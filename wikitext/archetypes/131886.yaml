  "'''Karakuri'''" (カラクリ ''Karakuri'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Starstrike Blast]]'', though its first member, "[[Karakuri Spider]]", debuted well below the rest of the archetype.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|Master Duel card storylines#Studying the Origins of the Karakuri}}

  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  The "Karakuri" monsters resemble wooden mechanized puppets or automata from Japan from the 17th century to 19th century. They are fashioned like characters from feudal Japan.

  === Etymology ===
  The word "''[[wikipedia:Karakuri ningyo|karakuri]]''" means a "''mechanical device to tease, trick, or take a person by surprise''". Like [[Wind-Up]] toys, they could only move in a predetermined pattern - this is reflected by the cards' effects, as they do not have a choice about whether they attack or defend. Most of them have names that are made up of [[wikipedia:Japanese numerals|Japanese numerals]], often the Japanese ''daiji'' 「大字」 or [[wikipedia:Japanese numerals#Formal numbers|Formal numbers]] are used. Multiplying the first 2 numbers in their names will give out the last number, with the exception of "[[Karakuri Barrel mdl 96 "Shinkuro"]]". The readings of some of the "Karakuris'" names also have English meanings relating to their role (Ninja, Muso, etc). For example, "[[Karakuri Ninja mdl 919 "Kuick"]]" can be pronounced as 'quick'. "[[Karakuri Barrel mdl 96 "Shinkuro"]]" can be pronounced as '[[Synchro Monster|Synchro]]', "[[Karakuri Muso mdl 818 "Haipa"]]" can be pronounced as 'Hyper' and "[[Karakuri Steel Shogun mdl 00X "Bureido"]]" can be pronounced as 'Blade'.

  Notably, the combined [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] of all "Karakuri" Synchro Monsters equal 4500.

  ==Playing style==
  Most "Karakuri" monsters, with the exception of the Synchro monsters, must attack if able and when attacked, change to Defense Position (The "Karakuri" released in [[Storm of Ragnarok]] simply change position). The "Karakuri" monsters do not always have high ATK or DEF, but have a very unique strategy based on changing the battle positions of monsters. Many "Karakuri" support cards are triggered when attacked, destroyed or shifted to Defense Position, and they generally play defensively, countering the opponent's moves. Other cards have the ability to change positions of cards on the field, draw cards, destroy cards, or search for other "Karakuri" monsters.

  Due to most "Karakuri" going to Defense Position when attacked, piercing effects work well against them.

  "Karakuri" can be used with [[Machine]] support cards like "[[Machina Fortress]]", as well as cards like "[[Machine Assembly Line]]" to increase the ATK of "Karakuri" monsters. Their [[DEF]] can be boosted by "[[Stronghold Guardian]]" or "[[Golden Gearbox]]". Their "attack if possible" effects can also be negated by cards like "[[Omega Goggles]]" and "[[Ekibyo Drakmord]]". Another profitable strategy is to use "[[De-Synchro]]" on any of the archetype's Synchro Monsters to gain more field presence. 

  Because all "Karakuri" monsters are EARTH monsters they can be used to make "[[Naturia]]" Synchro Monsters.

  Most modern "Karakuri" decks revolve around swarming the field with Synchros and field presence extremely quickly using cards such as "[[Iron Call]]", "[[Instant Fusion]]", "[[Emergency Teleport]]", "[[Solar Wind Jammer]]" and "[[De-Synchro]]" to create massive swarms of Synchro monsters in a single turn. 

  === Weaknesses ===
  "Karakuri" rely on massive amounts of Special Summons in one turn, making them vulnerable to any card that can stop that chain of summons. As a Machine deck, it is vulnerable to the most common counter to Machines, which is "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]"; as such, it is inadvisable to leave "[[Cyber Dragon]]" with your "Karakuri" monsters should your opponent have "Fortress Dragon" in their Extra Deck. "[[Chain Disappearance]]" totally destroys the "Karakuri" strategy, stopping "Komachi" or "Nishipachi" before the chain of Synchro Summons starts. In addition to that, "Karakuri" decks also have trouble with "Colossal Fighter" and monsters with ATK and DEF that are both higher than 2800. This deck usually relies on your chance of drawing either "[[Karakuri Komachi mdl 224 "Ninishi"]] '''or''' "[[Karakuri Strategist mdl 248 "Nishipachi"]]. The best way to increase your odds of getting them on the field is to activate "[[Machine Duplication]]" on either of the "Karakuri" monsters. Decks that attempt to summon multiple copies "Bureido" also have trouble with "[[Colossal Fighter]]" because it can get rid of all "Bureido" along with another "Karakuri" monster. "[[Summon Limit]]" prevents them from regaining advantage after a Synchro Summon or executing a long chain of Synchro Summons. "[[System Down]]" can banish all Machine monsters on the field and in the Graveyard. "[[Dark Highlander]]" completely shuts down any Synchro Summon attempt, and "[[Deck Devastation Virus]]" will destroy nearly every monster. However, "[[Evilswarm Ophion]]" is likely the deck's biggest weakness, as the deck's entire main function is rendered unusable and "Ophion"'s second effect will guarantee its protection from Spells or Traps as well. "[[El Shaddoll Winda]]" is similarly very problematic for the deck, allowing only one Special Summon per turn and being protected from destruction by card effects.

  == Trivia ==
  * The "Karakuri" archetype's debut in ''[[Starstrike Blast]] ''seems to be equivalent to the "[[Scrap]]" archetype's debut in ''[[Duelist Revolution]]''. Their [[Synchro Monster]]s have been released in [[Ultra Rare|Ultra]] and [[Ultimate Rare]] ("[[Karakuri Shogun mdl 00 "Burei"]]" and "[[Karakuri Steel Shogun mdl 00X "Bureido"]]"), one of their monsters and support cards are [[Super Rare]]s ("[[Karakuri Ninja mdl 339 "Sazank"]]" and "[[Karakuri Klock]]"), and the rest are [[Common]] and [[Rare]].

  * The "mdl" in the "Karakuri" monsters' English names is an abbreviation of "Model", i.e. "Karakuri Merchant Model #177 "Inashichi"" is "[[Karakuri Merchant mdl 177 "Inashichi"]]". The first two model numbers of all "Karakuri" [[Effect Monster]]s, except for "Karakuri Barrel MDL 96", give out the third and fourth when multiplied together.

  * The cloth flaps attached to most of the "Karakuri" monsters are called [[wikipedia:Shide (Shinto)|Shide]].
