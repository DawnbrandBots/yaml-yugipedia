  '''Vanquish Soul''' ({{Ruby|ＶＳ|ヴァンキッシュ・ソウル}} ''Vankisshu Souru'') is an [[Archetype|archetype]] of [[FIRE]], [[DARK]], and [[EARTH]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Wild Survivors]]''/''[[Wild Survivors]]''.

  ==Etymology==
  The name of the theme is likely in reference to how a fighting game introduces their opponents to the player as especially seen through the "VS" abbreviation on the cards in Japanese meant to refer to the word "versus".
   
  ==Design==
  The "Vanquish Soul" archetype shares many general aesthetics with those found in various popular fighting game franchises; such as ''[[wikipedia:Tekken|Tekken]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:BlazBlue|BlazBlue]]''. The archetype's monsters especially have designs that match the common character tropes rosters of this genre of games from monsters like "[[Vanquish Soul Razen]]" sharing common design elements with that of the standard Fighting Game Protagonist character to "[[Vanquish Soul Heavy Borger]]" being similar to the design of large grappler characters and the archetype's main boss monster, "[[Vanquish Soul Caesar Valius]]", taking ideas from the final boss of a fighting game.
   
  This influence can also be seen in the way the effects are formatted. The way many members of the archetype Special Summon themselves by returning other members of the archetype to the hand can be seen as representing tagging out to an assist character. The way each member has different effects depending on the quantity of Attributes revealed in the hand can be seen as representing different button inputs.

  ==Playing style==
  "Vanquish Soul" revolves around the shared ability to, as a [[Quick Effect]], [[Reveal|reveal]] monsters from the hand in order to activate a variety of effects depending on the revealed monster's Attribute. All "Vanquish Soul" monsters, by default, have one effect that can be activated by revealing a monster of the same Attribute as themselves with another, typically stronger, effect by revealing monsters in some combination of DARK, EARTH, or FIRE. As a result, each monster is able to fulfil a unique role to the Deck and able to make further advantage of using some of the best [[Hand trap]] cards in the game as well due to their attributes matching the main three used in "Vanquish Soul"; "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" for FIRE, "[[Ghost Belle & Haunted Mansion]] and "[[Maxx "C"]]" (in the OCG) for EARTH, and "[[D.D. Crow]]" for DARK.

  "[[Vanquish Soul Razen|Razen]]" and "[[Vanquish Soul Dr. Mad Love|Dr. Mad Love]]" make up the main searchers, able to add the monsters and backrow of the deck to hand as well as able to provide forms of removal with column-based monster destruction and non-targeting, non destruction removal. "[[Vanquish Soul Heavy Borger|Heavy Borger]]" and "[[Vanquish Soul Caesar Valius|Caesar Valius]]" make up the main boss monsters, able to Special Summon themselves by returning a "Vanquish Soul" that isn't the same Type as them to the hand with effects to draw a card and deal 1500 burn damage in the case of "Borger" and the effects to become unaffected by opponents card effects as well as pop a card on the field in the case of "Caesar", the latter needing to reveal 1 each DARK, EARTH, and FIRE to perform.

  Among the cards as well is the related [[Link Monster]], "[[Rock of the Vanquisher]]", which makes the opponent only able to attack the strongest monster while you control a "Vanquish Soul" as well as two Quick Effects to Special Summon a "Vanquish Soul" monster from hand or add one to the hand from the [[Graveyard|GY]], enabling easy and quick disruption abilities and swarming. 

  The theme is further supported through various [[Spell Card]]s and [[Trap Card]]s that offer extra consistency and bonus disruptions for the opponent to face.

  Due to the theme's main playstyle of revealing monsters of various attributes to activate their effects, player can allocate a large portion of the deck for various monster hand traps, such as "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" or "[[Effect Veiler]]" to both act as a prerequisite in summoning "Vanquish Soul" monsters and as an interruption.
