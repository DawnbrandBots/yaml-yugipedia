  "'''Resonator'''" is an [[archetype]] of [[Fiend]] [[Tuner monster]]s used by [[Jack Atlas]] and [[Imposter Jack Atlas|his imposter]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, as well as his [[Jack Atlas (ARC-V)|alternate universe counterpart]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. Their [[Card effect|effects]] are centered around being useful towards [[Synchro Summon]]ing and [[stall]]ing. With the exception of [[DIVINE]], there is at least one "Resonator" for each [[Attribute]]. Most of these monsters wield a tuning fork and a mallet.
  In the anime, "[[Clock Resonator]]" is the only [[Machine]] "Resonator", although it was changed to a Fiend when released in the ''[[OCG]]''. The first six "Resonator" monsters that were released in the OCG are each a different Attribute.

  ==Playing style==
  Earlier "Resonator" monsters generally have effects that protect them from battle or effect destruction. Later "Resonator" monsters generally have effects that enable swarming and Synchro combos, and they, as well as their support, generally interact with cards themed after [[Jack Atlas]]'s cards; these include high-Level and/or [[DARK]] and/or [[Dragon]] [[Synchro Monster]]s, "[[Red Dragon Archfiend]]"-specific support, or low-level [[Fiend]]s.

  As of [[Series 12]], "Resonator" monsters are near-exclusively played in "[[Red Dragon Archfiend (archetype)|Red Dragon Archfiend]]" decks, due to the cross-support between "RDA"-related support and "Resonator"-related support.
