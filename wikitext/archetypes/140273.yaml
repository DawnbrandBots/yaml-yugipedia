  "'''Resonator'''" is an [[archetype]] of [[Fiend]] [[Tuner monster]]s used by [[Jack Atlas]] and [[Imposter Jack Atlas|his imposter]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, as well as his [[Jack Atlas (ARC-V)|alternate universe counterpart]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. Their [[Card effect|effects]] are centered around being useful towards [[Synchro Summon]]ing and [[stall]]ing. With the exception of [[DIVINE]], there is at least one "Resonator" for each [[Attribute]]. Most of these monsters wield a tuning fork and a mallet.

  In the anime, "[[Clock Resonator]]" is the only [[Machine]] "Resonator", although it was changed to a Fiend when released in the ''[[OCG]]''. The first six "Resonator" monsters that were released in the OCG are each a different Attribute.

  ==Playing style==
  Earlier "Resonator" monsters typically have Defensive protection effects that protects them from being destroyed by battle or card effects. Later "Resonator" monsters have swarming-related effects revolving around controlling high-Level and/or [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] [[Synchro Monster]]s.

  "[[Crimson Resonator]]" and "[[Red Rising Dragon]]" both provide great swarming capacity to "Resonator" monsters, but restricts the player to only summoning DARK Dragon Synchro Monsters from the Extra Deck the turn their effects are activated. Because of this, current "Resonator" Decks (that take advantage of "Crimson Resonator" and "Red Rising Dragon") are typically combined with the "[[Red Dragon Archfiend (archetype)|Red Dragon Archfiend]]" archetype, and focus solely on RDA boss monsters.

  Within the "RDA-Resonator" Deck, "Crimson Resonator" and "Red Rising Dragon" are, as mentioned, both important swarm enablers to the strategy. "[[Resonator Call]]" is the main searcher Spell for the "Resonator" archetype, while "[[Resonator Command]]" is the Deck's secondary Fiend-general searcher Spell (which requires discarding a "Resonator"). The latter is typically used to search for the Level 4 non-Tuner monster "[[Wandering King Wildwind]]", who can Special Summon itself (to help make "Red Rising Dragon") and search for follow-up in the GY.
