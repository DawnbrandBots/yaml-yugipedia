  "'''Mermail'''" ({{Ruby|水精鱗|マーメイル}} ''Māmeiru'') is an [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Aqua]], [[Fish]] and [[Sea Serpent]] [[Monster Card|monsters]], used by [[Brooke Walker]] in the past, introduced in the ''[[Abyss Rising]]''. These monsters are based on [[wikipedia:Mermaid|mermaids]] outfitted with armor, hence "mail". They are intimately related to the "[[Abyss-]]" archetype, as they all belong to the archetype. The [[Level]] 3 "Mermail" monsters are all Aqua monsters, Level 4 "Mermail" monsters are all Fish monsters and Level 7 "Mermail" monsters are all Sea Serpent monsters, except for the Aqua "[[Mermail Abyssbalaen]]" and "[[Mermail Abyssteus]]".
  ==Design==
  Each "Mermail" monster is based on a real life aquatic animal. The original three Level 3 "Mermail" monsters released in ''Abyss Rising'', "[[Mermail Abysslinde]]", "[[Mermail Abyssgunde]]", and "[[Mermail Abysshilde]]" have names coming from the Rhinemaidens (Woglinde, Wellgunde, Flosshilde) in the German opera ''[[wikipedia:Der Ring des Nibelungen|Der Ring des Nibelungen]] (The Ring of the Nibelung)'' by [[wikipedia:Richard Wagner|Richard Wagner]]. The Level 7 "Mermail" monsters (excluding "[[Mermail Abyssbalaen]])", "[[Mermail Abyssmegalo]]", "[[Mermail Abyssleed]]" and "[[Mermail Abyssteus]]" take inspiration from [[wikipedia:extinct species|extinct aquatic species]]. The Xyz Monsters, "[[Mermail Abyssgaios]]" and "[[Mermail Abysstrite]]" take inspiration from [[wikipedia:Twelve Olympians|Ancient Greek deities]].

  == Story ==
  {{See also|Gagaga Academy Tospedia card storylines#"The Mermails and Atlanteans" Edition|Master Guide 4 card storylines#File No. 01: The Great Battle Raging between Fire and Water in the South Seas|Master Duel card storylines#The Tribe of the Abyssal Waters}}
  The "Mermails" used to peacefully live in their underwater city, "[[Lemuria, the Forgotten City|Lemuria]]", and albeit good in the arts of fighting, they would rarely use this ability. However, sudden changes in the earth's crust made "Lemuria" rise above the ocean, leaving the "Mermails" homeless. In that moment, the Emperor of the "[[Atlantean]]" army, "[[Poseidra, the Atlantean Dragon|Poseidra]]", choose to let the "Mermails" live under his protection, but they would have to obey his orders. Using the great treasure of the "Mermails", the [[Abyss-squall|Golden Ring]], to control the weather, "Poseidra" ordered an all-out attack against their archenemies, the "[[Fire King]]s". Unfortunately, “Poseidra’s” body was taken over by [[Mermail Abyssgaios|the king]] residing in the Ring. The king eliminated the “Atlantean” army with ease. It appears that “Abysstrite” sealed the Ring away because the advent of the king required a sacrifice.

  == Playing Style ==
  The "Mermail" archetype focuses on discarding or tributing WATER monsters to Special Summon "Mermail" monsters and activate their effects, and triggering additional effects off of these discards or tributes to generate advantage. They secondarily focus on interacting with the "[[Abyss-]]" archetype of Spell/Trap cards to support their strategy.
  Most [[Level]] 3 "Mermail" monsters (excluding "[[Mermail Abyssdine|Abyssdine]]" and "[[Mermail Abyssocea|Abyssocea]]") have similar [[Trigger Effect]]s that are triggered when they are [[send|sent]] to the [[Graveyard]], which usually Special Summons another "Mermail".

  |-
  ! Mermail !! Trigger Conditions (If/When this card is...) !! Triggered Effect

  |-
  | [[Mermail Abyssnerei‎|Abyssnerei‎]]
  | Sent from field to GY
  | Draw 1 card, then discard 1 card.
  |-
  |}

  Most Level 4 "Mermail" monsters (excluding "[[Mermail Abysslung|Abysslung]]" and "[[Mermail Abyssmander|Abyssmander]]") have Trigger Effects that can be activated when they are Normal or Special Summoned, and their effects involve discarding a WATER monster, which will trigger the above Level 3 monsters' effects.

  {| class="wikitable mw-collapsible autocollapse"
  ! colspan = 3 | Level 4 Mermail Summary
  |-
  ! Mermail !! Trigger Conditions (If/When this card [is]...) !! Triggered Effect
  |-

  | Normal or Special Summoned
  | Discard 1 WATER monster to GY, add 1 Level 3 WATER monster from Deck to hand.
  |-
  | [[Mermail Abyssturge|Abyssturge]]
  | Normal or Special Summoned
  | Discard 1 WATER monster to GY, add 1 Level ≤3 WATER monster from GY to hand.
  |}

  The Level 7 "Mermail" monsters each share two effects with a common effect pattern.
  {{Quote|
  #''"You can discard [Discard Cost] to the GY; Special Summon this card from your hand. When Summoned this way: You can [Effect 1]"''
  #''"You can Tribute [Tribute Cost]; [Effect 2]"''
  }}
  These effects will further trigger the Level 3 "Mermail" monsters' effects, and can also trigger some the ones that only trigger when sent from the field to GY via Tributing.

  |}

  The boss monster of the archetype, "[[Mermail Abyssgaios]]", is a Rank 7 Xyz monster that can prevent Level 5 or higher monsters from attacking, and negate the effects of opposing monsters with less ATK than it.

  The "Mermail" archetype supports, and is supported by, the "[[Abyss-]]" archetype of Spell/Traps. The "Abyss-" Traps provide some temporary power boosts or temporary Special Summons of "Mermail" monsters. The "Abyss-" Spells meanwhile are far more interesting: all the "Abyss-" Spells, the "Abyss-scale", are [[Equip Spell]]s that can only be equipped to "Mermail" monsters, and both boost the equipped monster's attack and provide 1 [[Negate|negation]] to an opponent's effect; "[[Abyss-scale of the Kraken|Kraken]]" negates a Monster, "[[Abyss-scale of the Mizuchi|Mizuchi]]" negates a Spell, and "[[Abyss-scale of Cetus|Cetus]]" negates a Trap. These negations are ''mandatorily'' applied to the first applicable effect they face, and they will immediately send themselves to the GY after negating one effect. Despite these drawbacks, the "Abyss-scale" cards are still searchable negates can significantly disrupt the opponent's plays.
  The main "Mermail" playstyle thus involves swarming "Mermail" monsters with Special Summoning effects, gaining advantage off of their own discards and tributes, and ultimately either beatdown the opponent by summoning several Level 7 beaters or controlling the field with "Abyssgaios" and the "Abyss-scale" Spells. "[[Mermail Abyssmegalo|Abyssmegalo]]" is thus vitally important for each of the three components of this strategy; it is a Level 7 beatstick that can Special Summon itself, discard other "Mermail" monsters, and search "Abyss-" Spell/Traps.

  The "Abyss-" trap card "[[Abyss-strom]]" connects the archetype to the "[[Umi (series)|Umi]]" series of [[Field Spell]]s, and the archetype does thematically have its own "archetypal Umi" in the form of "[[Lemuria, the Forgotten City]]". Though "Lemuria" is generic and does not specifically support "Mermail", it does support the "Mermail" playstyle of swarming monsters and making Xyz plays, enabling Xyz Monsters of other Ranks to be made.

  The "Mermail" archetype synergizes especially well with the "[[Atlantean]]" archetype, since their effects are activated when sent to the graveyard to activate a WATER monsters effect. By discarding "[[Atlantean Heavy Infantry]]", "[[Atlantean Marksman]]" or "[[Atlantean Dragoons]]", to activate the "Mermails" effects you can destroy a card on the field ("Heavy Infantry" and "Marksman") or search your Deck for any [[Sea Serpent]] monster ("Dragoons"), such as "Abyssmegalo", while also gaining the "Mermail" effects.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Cards that prevent searching or Special Summoning from the Deck, such as "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]", "[[Mistake]]", or "[[Deck Lockdown]]", slows down the archetype significantly, as the archetype requires significant searching to make combo plays and maintain their grind game.
  * Cards that negate card effect activations in the GY, such as "[[Debunk]]", "[[Silent Graveyard]]", "[[Necrovalley]]", "[[The End of Anubis]]", or "[[Soul Drain]]", halts many of the key GY monster effects the archetype.
  * Cards that banish cards sent to the GY, such as "[[Macro Cosmos]]" and "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", also prevents the archetype from activating their GY effects. It can also prevent "[[Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord]]" from being Summoned.
  * The archetype's need for discarding- and Tributing-friendly monsters means that it struggles to maintain its grind game if built or played poorly.
