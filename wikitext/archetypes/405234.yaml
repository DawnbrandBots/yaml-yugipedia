  "'''Fusion Dragon'''" (フュージョン・ドラゴン ''Fyūjon Doragon'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yuri]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" archetype, and is inherently related to the "[[Starving Venom]]" archetype. True to its name, all members of this archetype are [[Dragon]] [[Fusion Monster]]s, except for the [[Spellcaster]] [[Pendulum Monster]] "[[Purple Poison Magician]]".
  == Playing style ==
  The "Fusion Dragon" archetype is focused on "all-out stealing" and "nullifying", ranging from changing [[ATK]], gaining or negating [[effect]]s, and even [[destroy]] monsters when they are destroyed. 
  As two members of this archetype are members/support for the "[[Predaplant]]"/"[[Predap]]" archetype, the "Fusion Dragon" Fusion members basically serve as the bosses of "Predap" decks although "[[Starving Venom Fusion Dragon]]" can be easily brought out in a variety of decks.
  === With "Synchro Dragon", "Xyz Dragon" and "Pendulum Dragon" ===
  The play style offered by using the "Fusion Dragon", "[[Synchro Dragon]]", "[[Xyz Dragon]]" and "[[Pendulum Dragon]]" archetypes together is desgined to interact with "[[Supreme King Z-ARC]]". Both "[[Astrograph Sorcerer]]" and "[[Chronograph Sorcerer]]" can banish monsters of the four archetypes to Summon "Supreme King Z-ARC". In contrast, "[[Soul of the Supreme King]]" is the complete reverse of this, which can Special Summon "Z-ARC" without using any materials (though its effects are negated) but it can banish "Z-ARC" to Special Summon monsters from the four archetypes.
