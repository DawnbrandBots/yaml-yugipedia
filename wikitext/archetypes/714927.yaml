  "'''Favorite'''" (フェイバリット ''Feibaritto'') is an [[archetype]] of cards that are primarily related to the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Favorite" cards are minor pieces of support that can aid some "[[HERO]]" decks. "[[Favorite Hero]]" can search [[Field Spell Card]]s and protect Level 5 or higher "HERO" monsters from being targeted by the opponent's card effects, while "[[Favorite Contact]]" can Summon a Fusion Monster that lists a "HERO" monster by recycling the materials back into the Deck.

  The archetype is supported by "[[Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage]]", which can search or recycle one of the archetype's cards upon its Summon. Due to its [[Fusion Material]]s, the "Favorite" archetype cards are best used in "HERO" Decks that use "[[Elemental HERO]]" monsters.

  ==Trivia==
  * With the exception of "[[Eternal Favorite]]", all members and support for the "Favorite" archetype depict "[[Elemental HERO Flame Wingman]]" or one of its counterparts in their artworks. The archetype's name and its connection to the said card may be a reference to the numerous instances in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime where the series' protagonist [[Jaden Yuki]] (who uses "[[Elemental Hero Flame Wingman (later anime)|Elemental HERO Flame Wingman]]" as one of his signature cards) has described it as "his favorite monster".
  ** "Eternal Favorite" references Jaden's bond with [[Yubel (character)|Yubel]], whom he reconciled with at the end of their final Duel. "[[Yubel (anime)|Yubel]]" was his favorite card during his childhood, although the spirit within the card inflicted pain on his opponents whenever he played the card itself as a testament of its overprotectiveness towards Jaden.

  * In the ''[[TCG]]'', the "Favorite" archetype's support cards refer to it using this phrasing for archetypes: "''card with "Favorite" in its name''". This is similar to but not the same as the pre-[[Simplified Effect Text]] phrasing for [[archetype]] support: "''card(s) that include "[archetype]" in their names''", and was likely intended to remove ambiguity between the cards from this archetype and a person's favorite card in general.
