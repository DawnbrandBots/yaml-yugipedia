  "'''Favorite'''" (フェイバリット ''Feibaritto'') is an [[archetype]] of cards that are related to the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Favorite" cards are minor pieces of support that can aid some "[[HERO]]" decks. "[[Favorite Hero]]" being able to search [[Field Spell Card]]s, protecting Level 5 or higher "HERO" monsters from being targeted by the opponent's card effects while "[[Favorite Contact]]" can Summon a Fusion Monster that lists a "HERO" monster by recycling the materials back into the Deck.

  The archetype is supported by "[[Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage]]" which can search or recyle 1 of the archetype's cards upon its Summon. Due to its [[Fusion Material]]s, the "Favorite" archetype cards are best used in "HERO" Decks that use "[[Elemental HERO]]" monsters.

  ==Trivia==
  *So far, all members and support for the "Favorite" archetype depict "[[Elemental HERO Flame Wingman]]" or one of its counterparts in their artworks. The archetype's name and its connection to the said card may be a reference to the numerous instances in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime where the series' protagonist [[Jaden Yuki]] (who uses the [[Elemental Hero Flame Wingman (later anime)|Elemental HERO Flame Wingman]] as one of his signature cards) has described it as "his favorite monster".
