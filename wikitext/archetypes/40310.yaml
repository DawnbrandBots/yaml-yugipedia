  "'''Iron Chain'''", known as "'''Chain'''" ({{Ruby|Ｃ|チェーン}} ''Chēn'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an all-[[EARTH]] [[archetype]] from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' used by [[Mr. Armstrong]], included in ''[[Crossroads of Chaos]]''.
  "Iron Chain" cards focus upon a combination of [[mill]]ing the opponent's [[Deck]], manipulating the ATK and DEF of [[monster]]s on the field, and inflicting minor [[burn]] damage to the opponent. A Deck dedicated to "Iron Chain" monsters can be relatively flexible because of this. The user can use either "[[Poison Chain]]" to quickly make the opponent run out of cards, or "[[Iron Chain Repairman]]" to constantly recycle "[[Iron Chain Blaster]]" to burn the opponent each turn. Both can be used at once, and can be further devastating when combined with "[[Cemetary Bomb]]".  The user can also go for a beatdown strategy by taking advantage of how "[[Iron Chain Coil]]" can increase the ATK and DEF of an "Iron Chain" card permanently, as well as how "[[Iron Chain Dragon]]" can temporarily increase its own ATK.
  Most "Iron Chain" monsters are not very strong on their own. Without a card that can protect them during battle (e.g. "[[Scrap-Iron Scarecrow]]") or increase their ATK (e.g. "[[Gaia Power]]"), most cannot survive long - at least, not until "Iron Chain Coil" increases their ATK after a few turns. Since the archetype is not fully dedicated to a single method of defeating the opponent, it may not be as easy to control as other Archetypes, unless the user has a very good idea of what these cards are capable of as a group and what external support works well with their intended strategy.
  ==Playing style==
  "Iron Chains" are most basically used as a Mill Deck; however they can be used in a Burn Deck with "Iron Chain Blaster" and "[[Paralyzing Chain]]". "Iron Chain Repairman" is useful for reviving "Iron Chain" monsters from the [[Graveyard]]. This is useful, as "Poison Chain" needs "Iron Chain" monsters on the field to work. When used well, "Iron Chain" Decks can quickly achieve a [[Deck Out]].
