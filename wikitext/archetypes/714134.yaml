  "'''Branded'''" ({{Ruby|烙|らく}}{{Ruby|印|いん}} ''Rakuin'') is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Lightning Overdrive]]''.
  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX card storylines#No. 01: The Closed Land|The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines#No. 01: The Land of the Abyss|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 01: The Decisive Battle of the Northern Land}}

  ==Design==
  Similar to "[[World Legacy]]" throughout [[Series 10]], the "Branded" cards serve as a connecting narrative thread between many of the themes introduced throughout [[Series 11]] that are part of the [[The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines|Abyss storyline]] (such as "[[Dogmatika]]" and "[[Despia]]"), and detail major plot developments through their artworks.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Branded" is an archetype of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s (as well as one [[Fusion Monster]], "[[Albion the Branded Dragon]]") that support the [[Fusion Summon]]-based playstyles of "[[Fallen of Albaz]]" (and its related cards), the [[Ritual Summon]]-centric portion of the "[[Dogmatika]]" archetype, and generally supporting the "[[Despia]]" and "[[Bystial]]" archetypes. The "Branded" archetype generally serve as support to propel those archetypes' respective play styles by increasing advantage, recurring spent resources and/or providing protection and disruption capabilities.

  Alongside "Despia", the archetypes form an overarching playstyle typically called "Branded Despia"; within Branded Despia, "Branded" cards serve as the Deck's main playmakers, and accessing "Branded" cards via "Despia" monsters and "Albaz" Fusion Monsters composes the Deck's primary resource loop.

  For "Bystials", they are generally supported by the "Branded" [[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous Spells]] and [[Continuous Trap Card|Continuous Traps]]. "[[The Bystial Lubellion]]" and "[[Branded Beast]]" can place such cards directly from the Deck or GY respectively.

  The primary ways of searching "Branded" cards are "[[Aluber the Jester of Despia]]", "[[Springans Kitt]]" and "Albion the Branded Dragon". As an additional note, each of the "Branded" Spells & Traps that debuted in ''[[Lightning Overdrive]]'' have a shared [[only once per turn]] effect that Sets themselves to the [[field]] at the [[End Phase]] if discarded to activate the effect of "Fallen of Albaz". Similarly, other "Branded" Spells and Traps can recur themselves back to the hand when a Fusion Monster is sent to the GY (eg. "[[Branded in High Spirits]]" and "[[Brightest, Blazing, Branded King]]"), or by the effects of "[[Despian Tragedy]]", "Springans Kitt" and "[[Branded Retribution]]". "Branded" Spell/Traps can be sent to the GY with "[[Albion the Shrouded Dragon]]" or "[[Bystial Saronir]]" to set up for recursion or to banish them from the GY later for their additional effects (eg. "[[Branded Opening]]" to protect a Fusion Monster being destroyed or "[[Branded Sword]]" recurring a monster that is "Fallen of Albaz" or mentions said monster).
