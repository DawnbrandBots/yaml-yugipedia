  "'''Cyber Dragon'''" (サイバー・ドラゴン ''Saibā Doragon'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Machine]] monsters based on "[[Cyber Dragon]]". It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Cyber]]" archetype. "Cyber Dragon" cards are used by [[Zane Truesdale]], then later by [[Syrus Truesdale]], in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (manga)|manga]]''. First released in 2005 as a [[series]], it received its first full support in ''[[Structure Deck: Blitzkrieg of the Mechlight Dragons]]'' in 2013. The series was [[Cyber Dragon (Rush Duel series)|later released]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel]]'' in ''[[Over Rush Pack]]'', featuring ''Rush Duel''-original cards.
  The "[[Chimeratech]]" monsters are [[DARK]] Machine [[Fusion Monster]]s which are related to the "Cyber Dragon" archetype, but are not members of it; they each require either a "Cyber Dragon" or "Cyber Dragon" monster as their Fusion Materials.
  ==Design==
  ===Members===
  The "Cyber Dragon" monsters, aside from "[[Cyber Dragon]]" itself (and its [[Toon Monster]] direct counterpart "[[Toon Cyber Dragon]]"), can be divided into several subcategories.
  ====Pre-Cyber Dragons====
  These are two monsters that are considered in-universe to be precede the initial "Cyber Dragon", with "[[Proto-Cyber Dragon]]" being a prototype, and "[[Cyber Dragon Core]]" being "Cyber Dragon" before being outfitted with its external shell.
  ====Cyber Dragons with German Names====
  Some "Cyber Dragon" monsters have German words in their names, possibly referencing [[Zane Truesdale]]'s title of "Kaiser" in the anime and manga.

  ====Retrofitted Cyber Dragons====
  There are two specific monsters that depict "Cyber Dragon" monster retrofitted into different forms focusing on either full assault or protection through the effect of two specific [[Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s. One of these monsters is also remade for ''Rush Duel'' as a different monster that still reference its original ''OCG''/''TCG'' incarnation. Take note that due to their naming, they are not actually part of the "Cyber Dragon" archetype itself.

  ====Fusion Monsters====
  {{See also|Chimeratech}}
  There are several LIGHT or DARK Machine [[Fusion Monster]]s that support "Cyber Dragon" or its archetype, but lack the "Cyber Dragon" archetypal name. The DARK monsters among them also form their own monster [[series]], [[Chimeratech]]. These Fusion Monsters typically depict multiples of "Cyber Dragons" amalgamated into one being.

  |}

  ====Xyz Monsters====
  There are exactly two "Cyber Dragon" Xyz Monsters, the Rank 5 "[[Cyber Dragon Nova]]" and the Rank 6 "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]", with the latter being an upgraded form of the former that can even be Xyz Summoned using the former by itself.
  ====Other "Cyber Dragon"-Related====
  There are also other "Cyber" monsters that aren't part of the "Cyber Dragon" archetype nor fit into the preceding categories, but still have visual design based on "Cyber Dragon" and are related outside of gameplay. These are "[[Cyber Larva]]", "[[Cyber Valley]]", "[[Cyber Dinosaur]]", "[[Cyber Phoenix]]", "[[Cyber Ouroboros]]" and "[[Cyber Eltanin]]".
  ==Playing style==
  The "Cyber Dragon" archetype is centered on the monster "[[Cyber Dragon]]", a Level 5 LIGHT Machine monster that can Special Summon itself from the hand if only the opponent controls a monster. In terms of general game plan, the archetype is primarily focused on achieving a quick [[One Turn Kill]] with their powerful [[Fusion Monster]]s, and secondarily focused on controlling the game state with the Xyz Monster "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]".
  The Main Deck low-Level "Cyber Dragon" monsters serve as the Deck's main Normal Summons and supportive monsters. Several of them share the effect to change their name to "Cyber Dragon" while in the Field/GY; this supports certain card effects that require the presence of "Cyber Dragon", "[[Machine Duplication]]", and Fusion Material requirements specifying "Cyber Dragon". Of these monsters, the key ones are "Core", "Nachster", and "Herz".

  | [[Cyber Dragon Core|Core]]

  * Combo starter by searching for "Cyber" Spell/Traps when Normal Summoned.
  * GY effect provides comeback capabilities.

  | [[Cyber Dragon Herz|Herz]]
  |
  * Advantage-neutral discard target for "Nachster" and "[[Galaxy Soldier]]".
  * Second effect can situationally be used for Xyz plays.
  |}
  "Cyber Dragon" Extra Deck monsters have varied effects and varied applications: the Fusion Monsters focus on raw damage output, two "Chimeratech" Fusion Monsters feature [[Contact Fusion|unique Summoning conditions]] that let them act as special forms of removal, the Xyz Monsters focus on controlling the game state, and the Link Monster provides situational utility.

  | rowspan = 2 | [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]]
  | Xyz Summoned with 2 Level 5 Machines. Can revive a "Cyber Dragon" for more combos, boost its own ATK, and can float into a Machine Fusion Monster. Required bridge to "Infinity" with several good effects itself.

  To summon "Nova" and "Infinity", the archetype aims to swarm Level 5 Machine monsters, usually with these two methods:
  * Using "[[Machine Duplication]]" on a low-level "Cyber Dragon" monster, whose name is treated as "Cyber Dragon".
  * Summon "[[Galaxy Soldier]]" by discarding "[[Cyber Dragon Herz|Herz]]", triggering both of their effects to get another "Galaxy Soldier" and another "Cyber Dragon", then summon the second "Galaxy Soldier".
  The "[[Cyber]]" Spell/Trap cards are the primary Spell/Trap support for "Cyber Dragon", and are searchable by "Cyber Dragon Core". "[[Cyber Repair Plant]]" and "[[Cyber Emergency]]" can search "Cyber Dragon" and/or LIGHT Machine monsters in general (including "Galaxy Soldier" for "Cyber Repair Plant"), "[[Cyber Revsystem]]" is a searchable GY reborn Spell, "[[Cyberload Fusion]]" is a searchable Quick-Play Fusion Spell that can recycle banished monsters, and "[[Cybernetic Overflow]]" is a Trap Card that can destroy multiple opposing cards without targeting.
  The Deck is generally built as a blind-second OTK deck, aiming to clear the opponent's board with going-second staples, then swarm the field to summon a "Cyber Dragon Infinity" and a "[[Predaplant Verte Anaconda]]", who will copy "Overload Fusion" to Fusion Summon "Chimeratech Rampage Dragon" and OTK.
  The "Cyber Dragon" archetype has some overlapping support with the "[[Cyberdark]]" archetype, though a mixed "Cyber Dragon"-"Cyberdark" Deck leans more towards the "Cyberdark" playstyle and is thus described on the "Cyberdark" page.
  Outside of the archetype, as most cards lock the player into only summoning Machine monsters, the archetype can employ a variety of additional monster options. Since "[[Cyber Repair Plant]]" can search out any LIGHT Machine monsters, the deck has relatively easy access to "[[Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju]]", a "[[Kaiju]]" monster that provides a quick Monster removal option and can be easily dealt with later on, either using "Jizukiru" as the material for "Chimeratech Fortess Dragon", or absorb it with "Cyber Dragon Infinity". Another notable LIGHT Machine monster is "[[Arcjet Lightcraft]]", which can be summoned with the discard effect of "Cyber Dragon Nachster" and grants an access to Rank 9 Machine Xyz pool.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * As an archetype of LIGHT and DARK Machine monsters, specific Attribute and Typing counters such as "[[Ally of Justice]]" and "[[System Down]]" can hamper the deck's effectiveness.
  * Some key cards of the archetype, such as "Cyber Repair Plant" and "Cyber Revsystem", require the Graveyard to be set up in order to be used to its full effect. As such, cards that [[banish]] cards that would be sent to GY, such as "[[Dimension Shifter]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]" can slow down the deck. Though this is somewhat remedied by the effects of "Cyberload Fusion" and "[[Cyber Network]]".
  * "Chimeratech Fortress Dragon" and "Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon", despite being related to the archetype, can function as counters against the archetype itself; a "Cyber Dragon" player's opponent can use all the "Cyber Dragon" monsters and Machine monsters on the established "Cyber Dragon" field into materials to summon "Fortress Dragon" and "Megafleet Dragon", demolishing the field without giving a chance for a counterplay.
