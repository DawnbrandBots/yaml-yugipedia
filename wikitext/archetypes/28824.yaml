  "'''Armed Dragon'''" (アームド・ドラゴン, ''Āmudo Doragon'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Monster Card|monsters]] introduced in ''[[Soul of the Duelist]]'', composed primarily of [[WIND]] [[Dragon]] "[[LV]]" monsters. First support for this archetype did not appear until ''[[Duelist Pack: Legend Duelist 2]]'', which also released cards that tie this theme heavily to the "[[Ojama]]" and [[A-to-Z]] themes. All three of these themes were used famously in one Deck by [[Chazz Princeton]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime.

  "[[Hardened Armed Dragon]]" is not a member of this archetype due to its Japanese name ({{card name|Hardened Armed Dragon|ja}}).

  ==Playing style==
  The original "Armed Dragon" archetype focused on [[send]]ing cards from the [[hand]] to the [[Graveyard]] to [[destroy]] monsters on the [[field]]. Depending on the [[ATK]] of the monster sent, certain monsters could be destroyed while others were not. "[[Armed Dragon LV10]]", being the strongest, simply destroys all [[face-up]] monsters regardless of their ATK and ''any'' card could be sent from the hand to the Graveyard, rather than only monsters, as was the case with the lesser forms.

  The second wave of support, introduced in ''[[Blazing Vortex]]'', focuses on an additional lineup: the [[Armed Dragon Thunder]] series. While the original "Armed Dragon" monsters focused primarily on destructive effects, the Armed Dragon Thunder ones attempts to expedite the process of 'leveling up' "Armed Dragon" monsters as much as possible, being able to upgrade themselves with a simple discard of a monster in the hand. Additionally, they replenish advantage when discarded, making it feasible to cycle through to their strongest monster, "[[Armed Dragon Thunder LV10]]," with a single [[Normal Summon]]. Due to the nature of their effects, being treated as the originals while on the field, they can also be used to instead upgrade into one of the original lineup. Once "LV10" is active, the deck then uses various support cards to pump its ATK as high as possible, so as to reach 10,000 ATK and activate "LV10's" strongest effect, which will usually end a Duel on the spot. "LV10" can also attempt to disrupt the opponent mid-turn by discarding other "Armed Dragons".

  One can also attempt to hybridize the Deck with the "[[Ojama]]" lineup, as "[[Ojamatch]]" is an interesting support card and "[[Ojamagic]]" can provide discard fodder. However, this is generally not recommended, as "[[Armed Dragon Flash]]" can fill much the same role as "Ojamagic", and the combo as a whole will suffer from lack of consistency. Unless one is attempting to Summon "[[Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon]]", it is best to focus on [[Dragon]] support and pushing "LV10" to its fullest.

  }}

  ==Weaknesses==
  * In general, the Deck's major weaknesses are its lackluster consistency, as it has few low-[[Level]] monsters and not many search cards, and its poor protection, with limited destruction protection from "[[Armed Dragon Lightning]]" and "LV10" only having immunity from switching control. Because of this, disrupting its initial plays will often put it too far behind to come back.

  * "[[Deck Lockdown]]" prevents the Deck from playing at all without either removal or another Dragon-type extender in the hand.

  * "[[Poisonous Winds]]" can prevent this Deck from maintaining any major field presence, as well as reducing the ATK of most monsters that they manage to Normal Summon.
