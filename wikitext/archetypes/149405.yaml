  "'''Meklord Astro'''", known as "'''Machine Imperial God'''" ({{Ruby|機|き}}{{Ruby|皇|こう}}{{Ruby|神|しん}} ''Kikōshin'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is a small sub-[[archetype]] of the "Meklord" archetype, comprised of high-[[Level]] [[DARK]] and [[LIGHT]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monster]]s. They were used by [[Aporia]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime. Members have existed since 2011, but the archetype did not receive first support until ''[[Duelist Pack: Duelists of Gloom]]'' in 2020.
