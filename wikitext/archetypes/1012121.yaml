  "'''Silenforc'''" ({{Ruby|粛|しゅく}}{{Ruby|声|せい}} ''Shukusei'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] monsters introduced in ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]''. It is related to the "[[Skull Guardian (archetype)|Skull Guardian]]" [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]] archetype.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  The theme's Japanese name is a play on 粛正 (''shukusei'', "regulation"), where the first kanji can mean "solemn" or "quiet", and the second one is replaced with 声 ("voice"). It may be a reference to the ''TCG'' name of "[[Novox's Prayer]]", as "Novox" can be interpreted as "no vox" (from ''vōx'', Latin for "voice").

  ===Members===
  All members share the same [[Attribute]], [[Type]], [[Level]], [[ATK]], and [[DEF]] as their original counterparts (except for "Novox", whose counterpart is a [[Ritual Spell Card|Ritual Spell]]).

  ==Playing style==
  "Silenforc" can consistently perform multiple Ritual Summons in a single turn. The key cards are "Novox, the Silenforcer Disciple", "Skull Guardian, the Silenforcing Protector", and the archetype's Ritual Spell, "Silenforcing Prayer". Ritual Summoning "Skull Guardian, the Silenforcing Protector" by Tributing "Novox" would in turn give the player further access to another "Silenforc" monster (or any Warrior or Dragon Ritual monster in general), also, "Novox" can be revived from the GY by the time "Skull Guardian" is Summoned. The Normal/Special Summoned "Novox" enables the player to play one of the archetype's Continuous Spell/Trap directly from the Deck. The option, however, is a bit situational ; the Continuous Spell "Silenforcing Barrier" is a good card that provides protection to your LIGHT monsters, while at the same time redirects opponent's attacks toward your Ritual Monsters only. The spell also allows the player to tutor any "Silenforc" card or a "Skull Guardian" Ritual Monster from the Deck, promoting another variety of gameplay with any "Silenforc" card or another Ritual Summoning. If the player chose to play the Continuous Trap "Silenforcing Authority", it allows player to add (or in some case, Special Summon) a "Silenforc" monster straight from the Deck, or access more offensive play for field removal.
