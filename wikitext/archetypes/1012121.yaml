  "'''Silenforc'''" ({{Ruby|粛|しゅく}}{{Ruby|声|せい}} ''Shukusei'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] monsters introduced in ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]''. It is related to the "[[Skull Guardian (archetype)|Skull Guardian]]" [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]] archetype.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  The theme's Japanese name is a play on 粛正 (''shukusei'', "regulation"), where the first kanji can mean "solemn" or "quiet", and the second one is replaced with 声 ("voice"). It may be a reference to the ''TCG'' name of "[[Novox's Prayer]]", as "Novox" can be interpreted as "no vox" (from ''vōx'', Latin for "voice").

  ===Members===
  All members share the same [[Attribute]], [[Type]], [[Level]], [[ATK]], and [[DEF]] as their original counterparts (except for "Novox", whose counterpart is a [[Ritual Spell Card|Ritual Spell]]).

  ==Playing style==
  "Silenforc" focuses on Ritual Summoning "Skull Guardian, the Silenforcing Protector". It shares identical stats as its original, [[Skull Guardian|classic counterpart]], with unique ATK value at 2050, but if "Novox, the Silenforcer Disciple" is on the field or [[GY]], it can boost its own ATK to 4100. However, if the latter is present on the same board, "Skull Guardian, the Silenforcing Protector" is also able to act as an omni-negate.

  This archetype can effectively perform multiple Ritual Summons in a single turn. Ritual Summoning "Skull Guardian, the Silenforcing Protector" by Tributing "Novox, the Silenforcer Disciple" (which can serve as an entire Tribute for the Ritual Summon) would in turn give the player further access to another "Silenforc" monster (or any Warrior or Dragon Ritual monster in general), also, "Novox" can be revived from the GY by the time "Skull Guardian, the Silenforcer Protector" is Special Summoned.

  The Normal/Special Summoned "Novox" enables the player to play one of the archetype's Continuous Spell/Trap directly from the Deck. The option, however, is situational; the Continuous Spell "[[Silenforcing Barrier]]" is a good card that provides protection to your LIGHT monsters, while at the same time redirects opponent's attacks toward your Ritual Monsters only. This continuous effect is effective to protect "Novox" from attacks and card effects, while the buffed "Skull Guardian, the Silenforcer Protector" can serve as a big wall for battles. The spell also allows the player to tutor any "Silenforc" card or a "Skull Guardian" Ritual Monster from the Deck, promoting another variety of gameplay with any "Silenforc" card, such as "[[Saffira, the Wise Silenforcer Queen]]" to perform further combo of Ritual Summoning. If the player chose to play the Continuous Trap "[[Silenforcing Authority]]", it allows player to add (or in some case, Special Summon) a "Silenforc" monster straight from the Deck, or access more offensive play for field removal.

  This archetype works well with the other thematic Ritual Monsters: "[[Saffira, Queen of Dragons]]" and "[[Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended]]". They normally require "[[Hymn of Light]]" and "[[Sprite's Blessing]]" respectively to Summon, but both of them can also be Ritual Summoned by "Silenforcing Prayer" or by the effect of "Saffira, the Wise Silenforcer Queen". In addition to its connection to the archetype's lore, "Hymn of Light" is actually a good choice for the first effect of "Saffira, the Wise Silenforcer Queen" where it can mill the Spell to tutor a LIGHT Warrior or Dragon Ritual Monster from the Deck or GY, and at the same time, "Hymn of Light" in the GY provides destruction protection for your Ritual Monster(s).

  On the other hand, "[[Sauravis, the Sagely Silenforcer Dragon]]" is more likely to be an alternative beatstick that can be Special Summoned by shuffling two Spells, with at least one Ritual Spell among them, from the hand and/or GY to the Deck. It can also provide 'emergency' Ritual Summoning of any LIGHT Warrior or Dragon Ritual Monster from the player's hand or Deck in response to the activation of your opponent's card or effect.
