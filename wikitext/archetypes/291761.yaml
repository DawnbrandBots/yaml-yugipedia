  "'''Numeron'''" (ヌメロン, ''Numeron'') is an [[archetype]] used by [[Yuma Tsukumo]] and [[Don Thousand]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime, based on the [[Numeron Code]].
  The two "Numeron" [[Spell Card]]s that Yuma uses focus on [[Xyz Evolution]], being used to Summon "[[Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory (anime)|Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory]]" and "[[Number 39: Utopia Roots (anime)|Number 39: Utopia Roots]]". He also has "[[Number 100: Numeron Dragon (anime)|Number 100: Numeron Dragon]]", after obtaining it from [[Mizar]].
  The cards that Don Thousand uses mainly revolve around activating during the opponent's turn from the [[hand]] or even the [[Deck]], and are described as holding the power of the Numeron Code, being able to "rewrite" the opponent's cards and increase their own [[ATK]] to extremely high levels.
  The "[[Numerounius]]" archetype can be considered an upgrade to this archetype, containing related monsters with even higher ATK and stronger effects.
  ==Members==
  Cards based on members of this archetype were used in [[Boss Duel]], a special type of Duel performed in Japan during a Yu-Gi-Oh! Day event:

  ==Playing style==
  The main strategy of "Numeron" Decks involves using "[[Numeron Calling]]" to Summon up to 4 "Numeron Gate" Xyz Monsters to perform an [[OTK]]. Each "Numeron Gate" monsters has an effect to doubling the ATK of each other when they battled an opponent's monster, giving them a potential ATK increase of up to 16,000 with their effect alone.
  "[[Numeron Network]]" can copy the effect of "[[Numeron Calling]]" to accomplish this, with "Network" itself being searchable by "[[Numeron Wall]]" during either player's turn, provided they control no other cards (barring copies of "Wall" itself). "[[Memories of Hope]]" can be used to draw up to 4 cards after activating "Numeron Calling", giving you massive hand advantage, helped by the Deck being able to thin itself by a few cards prior, thus allowing better access to board-breakers and powerful [[staple]]s. "[[Kaiju]]" monsters were an ideal choice to remove an opponent's monster and acts as a "target" for the "Numeron" monsters to attack into.

  ==Weaknesses==
  * The deck has a generally poor board presence and relatively few disruption choices during the opponent's turn. If the opponent managed to survive the OTK attempt, player has a high risk of being counterattacked or even potential OTK in return.
  * "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" can seriously damage this Deck, since "Numeron Calling" Summons up to 4 monsters and as a result, makes the usage of other monsters such as "[[Number C1: Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya]]" a risky endeavor.
  * Cards such as "[[Macro Cosmos]]" can shut off the Deck entirely, as "Network" will not be able to send any copies of "Calling" to the GY if the player does not open/draw into the latter card early on.
  ** "Network" itself is essential and without it, the Deck would not function at all, thus protecting it is a necessity.
