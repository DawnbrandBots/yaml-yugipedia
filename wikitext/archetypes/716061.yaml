  "'''Nouvelles'''", spelled "'''Nouvellez'''" (ヌーベルズ ''Nūberuzu'') in Japanese, is an [[Archetype|archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Beast-Warrior]] and [[Warrior]] [[Ritual Monster]]s with 1850 DEF introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Wild Survivors]]''/''[[Wild Survivors]]''.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  "Nouvelles" is named after [[wikipedia:Nouvelle cuisine|nouvelle cuisine]], a style of French cuisine characterized by delicate dishes that emphasize presentation.

  ===Members===
  Each of the "Nouvelles" monsters (except the "[[Nouvelles Token]]") are based on both a demon (principally from the ''[[wikipedia:Ars Goetia|Ars Goetia]]'') and an aspect of French cuisine. Their names are a combination of the name of the demon and the French name of the aspect of French cuisine. Each member has a varying number of star decoration(s) on their body, matching with their Level. They all have 1850 [[DEF]], the same as the related "[[Hungry Burger]]".

  ==Playing style==
  "Nouvelles" is an archetype of [[Ritual Monster]]s centered around [[Tribute|Tributing]] [[Attack Position]] monsters. All "Nouvelles" monsters have effects that allow them to Tribute cards when targeted for an attack or a card effect to [[Special Summon]] a "Nouvelles" monster that is 1 or 2 Levels higher than that monster's Level. Each pair of monsters also share activation conditions with one another. For example: The [[Level]] 1 and 2 monsters, "[[Buerillabaisse de Nouvelles]]" and "[[Confiras de Nouvelles]]", share the effect that when they are targeted for an attack or effect, they can Tribute themselves and 1 Attack Position monster on either side of the field to Special Summon a new "Nouvelles" monster with 1 or 2 Levels higher than them from the [[hand]] or Deck. The Level 3 and 4 monsters, "[[Poeltis de Nouvelles]]" and "[[Foie Glasya de Nouvelles]]", share a similar effect, which can be activated when any monster is targeted, and they can also Tribute other "Nouvelles" monsters over themselves. Finally, the Level 5 "[[Balameuniere de Nouvelles]]" can Tribute just an opponent's Attack Position monster to Summon only a Level 6 monster while the Level 6 "[[Baelgrill de Nouvelles]]" can Tribute the opponent's Attack Position monsters to Special Summon "[[Hungry Burger]]".

  The main goal of "Nouvelles" is to establish a quick chain of Special Summons in order to speed through making the higher Levels of Rituals in order to remove the opponent's field through powerful effects. Due to the ease at which the cards are able to be recurred, the theme is able to afford running lower numbers of their actual monsters and going for various engines and tech cards. "Nouvelles" monsters are also supported by the "[[Recipe]]" cards, an archetype that helps establish board presence and interrupt the opponent's plays.

  The effects of the Ritual Monsters can be proactively activated during your turn using either the [[Pendulum Effect]] of "[[Poissonniere de Nouvelles]]" (which targets a monster to Special Summon itself and subsequently change the target's [[Battle Position]]), or the [[Graveyard]] effect of "[[Concours de Cuisine (Culinary Confrontation)]]" (which banishes itself to target an on-field monster to increase its [[ATK]] for each "[[Recipe]]" card in the GY's). "[[Recette de Personnel (Staff Recipe)]]" can accomplish this same goal during your opponent's turn by targeting a "[[Nouvelles]]" monster to Summon a "[[Nouvelles Token]]" copying its Level, as well as "[[Enemy Controller]]" and other such chainable targeting effects.
