  "'''Rescue-ACE'''" ({{Ruby|Ｒ－ＡＣＥ|レスキュー・エース}} ''Resukyū Ēsu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Warrior]] and [[Machine]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Amazing Defenders]]''/''[[Amazing Defenders]]''.
  == Etymology ==
  The archtype's name "Rescue-ACE" is based on the "R.A.C.E." firefighters safety procedure, of which the card "[[RESCUE!]]", "[[ALERT!]]", "[[CONTAIN!]]", and "[[EXTINGUISH!]]" is a reference to these procedure.
  == Design ==
  [[File:Crest-RescueACE.png|thumb|left|100px|The "Rescue-ACE" crest.]] The archetype's design is based on the tokusatsu show ''[[wikipedia:Tomica Hero: Rescue Force|Tomica Hero: Rescue Force]]'', which features various [[wikipedia:Fire engine|fire engines]] and firefighters alike as the heroes saving people from disasters caused by evil forces using various special vehicles.

  == Playing style ==
  "Rescue-ACE" is a theme with a [[Control|control-centered]] playstyle, with a central resource loop revolving around its boss monster "[[Rescue-ACE Turbulence]]". Once per turn, as an [[Ignition Effect]], "Turbulence" can [[set]] up to 4 "Rescue-ACE" [[Quick-Play Spell]]s and/or [[Normal Trap]]s with different names directly from the Deck. The Deck's other cards focus on supporting the massive card advantage provided by "Turbulence" by providing it with utility, consistency, recovery, and/or additional swarming.
  "Rescue-ACE" monsters consist of Main Deck Machine monsters and Warrior monsters. Aside from the Level 9 Machine "[[Rescue-ACE Turbulence]]" and the Level 1 Machine "[[Rescue-ACE Hydrant]]", the Deck's other monsters can be broadly divided into two types:
  * The Level 3 and 4 Warrior monsters all share a [[Quick Effect]] to [[Tribute]] themselves from the [[hand]] or field when the opponent activates a [[Monster effect]] on the field, in order to Special Summon a Machine "Rescue-ACE" monster from the hand, [[GY]] or [[Main Deck|Deck]].
  * The Level 6 and 7 Machine monsters all can be Special Summoned from the hand if a "Rescue-ACE" monster is Normal or Special Summoned to the field other than themselves.
  The Deck's boss monster, "[[Rescue-ACE Turbulence]]", can Special Summon itself by banishing two "Rescue-ACE" cards from the [[Graveyard|GY]]. As mentioned, its effect to set up to 4 "Rescue-ACE" Quick-Play Spells/Normal Traps from the Deck is the Deck's key resource generator, so getting access to "Turbulence" and making sure its effect resolves is the Deck's main goal during setup.
  A secondary key monster within the theme is "[[Rescue-ACE Hydrant]]". "Hydrant" is the Deck's starter, being able to easily and actively search for "Turbulence". It also features additional self-protection effects, and its presence enables the Deck's Spell/Traps to use additional effects.
  The theme's Spell and Trap cards are its main control element. The Quick-Play Spells and Normal Traps have basic supportive/disruptive effects that are enhanced while you control "Rescue-ACE Hydrant", while the Field Spell, "[[Rescue-ACE HQ]]", helps to aid in resource management and supporting getting monsters onto the board.

  The archetype consists of [[FIRE]] [[Warrior]] monsters, as well as [[Machine]] monsters whose ATK equals their own DEF, and thus benefits from various "[[Gizmek]]", "[[Igknight]]", and "[[Infernoble Knight]]" support cards. In addition, since "Rescue-ACE Hydrant" is a [[Level 1 Monster Cards|Level 1]] FIRE monster, the archetype also synergize well with the "[[Sinful Spoils]]" cards, particularly "[[Original Sinful Spoils - Snake-Eye]]" that can either search of special summon "Hydrant" from the deck with more consistency.
