  "'''Ice Barrier'''" ({{Ruby|氷|ひょう}}{{Ruby|結|けっ}}{{Ruby|界|かい}} ''Hyōkekkai'') is an [[archetype]] consisting of [[WATER]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] resembling, for the most part, famous concepts, figures, warriors, and mythological beings of different Asian cultures. Their team symbol resembles a hexagonal snowflake.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Ice Barrier" archetype consists of a large amount of Main Deck Effect Monsters, several [[Synchro Monster]]s that act as boss monsters, and some archetypal Spell/Trap support. The archetype's playstyle is focused on Summoning multiple different Main Deck "Ice Barrier" monsters, combining their individual protection effects to handicap the opponent, and Synchro Summon its boss monsters to break the opponent's board and push for game. After multiple waves of support, the latest iteration of the Deck can perform this quite consistently.

  "[[Lancea, Dragonic Ancestor of the Ice Spirit Mountain]]" is a Level 10 Synchro Monster that can Summon an "Ice Barrier" monster from the [[hand]], [[Deck]], [[GY]] or [[Extra Deck]] up to twice per turn, when the opponent Special Summons a monster. This card can single-handedly enable the lockdown effects of nearly every "Ice Barrier" monster, and thus Summoning it is the focus of the modern play style of the archetype. It also has a second effect, which Special Summons an "Ice Barrier" monster from the Extra Deck (by treating it as a [[Synchro Summon]]) when it leaves the field due to the opponent's card. This can be combined with "[[Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]" or "[[Trishula, Zero Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]", to [[banish]] the opponent's cards. By combining both effects, "Lancea" alone puts a lot of pressure on the opponent, especially when combined with the right "Ice Barrier" monsters.

  One simple method to Summon "Lancea" requires only "[[Revealer of the Ice Barrier]]". "Revealer" can discard a card to Summon "[[Hexa Spirit of the Ice Barrier]]", which can send "[[Mirror Magic Master of the Ice Barrier]]" to the [[GY]], and trigger its effect to search "[[Georgius, Swordsman of the Ice Barrier]]". Next, "Georgius" can Special Summon itself from the hand, and Summon "Mirror Magic Master" from the GY. "Lancea" can be Synchro Summoned using "Georgius" and "Revealer", while "Mirror Magic Master" can [[Tribute]] "Hexa Spirit" to Summon 3 "[[Ice Barrier Token]]s" and increase its Level to 5, allowing for the Synchro Summon of "[[Adamancipator Risen - Dragite]]".

  Among the monsters that can be Summoned by "Lancea", "[[General Raiho of the Ice Barrier]]" is one of the best targets, since it forces the opponent to discard a card in order to resolve their monster effects activated on the field, and it does not require the player to control another "Ice Barrier" monster. "Georgius, Swordsman of the Ice Barrier" is another great target, since it can prevent the opponent from activating monster effects in the GY, and also Summon a second "Ice Barrier" monster from the hand or GY in order to turn on its effect. "[[Warlock of the Ice Barrier]]" acts as an "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]", preventing both players from activating Spell Cards before Setting them, and forcing them to wait a turn before doing so.

  The Deck features several [[extender]]s, which allow the player to continue their turn even if "Revealer" or "Mirror Magic Master" are [[negate]]d. "Georgius", as mentioned before, can Summon itself from the hand and another Level 5 or lower "Ice Barrier" from the hand or GY, but only if the player controls an "Ice Barrier" monster. "[[Speaker for the Ice Barriers]]" can also Summon itself from the hand, and can also [[banish]] itself from the GY to Special Summon an "Ice Barrier Token". "[[Freezing Chains of the Ice Barrier]]" is a [[Continuous Spell]] that can Special Summon a Level 4 or lower "Ice Barrier" monster from the GY when it is activated, while also protecting "Ice Barrier" monsters from the effects of the opponent's Extra Deck monsters. "[[General Wayne of the Ice Barrier]]" can Special Summon itself from the hand by controlling an "Ice Barrier" monster, but also requires the opponent to control a monster. However, it can search any "Ice Barrier" Spell/Trap when Summoned.

  "[[Medallion of the Ice Barrier]]" is the Deck's main consistency card, searching for any "Ice Barrier" monster. "[[Winds Over the Ice Barrier]]" is a more risky option, Tributing any number of "Ice Barrier" monsters to Summon the same number of "Ice Barrier" monsters from the Deck. Given the great cost required to activate it, it is recommended to use it only at the end of the combo, far beyond a point in which the opponent would have used a [[hand trap]] (such as "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]"). Outside the archetype's cards, "[[Small World]]" is also a great option for the Deck, since the only shared element between all cards is their [[Attribute]] ([[WATER]]), thus allowing the player to trade any combo piece in their hand (or even hand traps such as "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]") for another extender or "Revealer".

  Finally, the Deck can use its several extenders to Summon its Extra Deck monsters. "[[Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]" is a classic boss monster that can banish up to 1 card from the opponent's hand, field and GY. "[[Trishula, Zero Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]" can banish up to 3 cards the opponent controls, instead. "[[Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]" and "[[Gungnir, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]" are also removal options, that discard cards in order to [[bounce]] or [[destroy]] the opponent's cards. "[[Dewloren, Tiger King of the Ice Barrier]]" can [[return]] cards the player controls to the hand, which works perfectly with "Freezing Chains of the Ice Barrier".

  The archetype can also make use of other powerful Extra Deck monster, mainly WATER monsters. "Revealer" and "Speaker" can be used to [[Xyz Summon]] "[[Bahamut Shark]]", which can Summon "[[Toadally Awesome]]", a card able to negate and destroy any activated card. "Mirror Magic Master", combined with its 3 Tokens, plus another Token from "Speaker", can Synchro Summon "[[Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys]]", and allow the player to draw 4 cards. Any 2 "Ice Barrier" monsters can Summon "[[Marincess Coral Anemone]]", which is used to bring back "Mirror Magic Master" from the GY. By combining "Georgius" with any Level 4 monster, "[[Icejade Gymir Aegirine]]" can be Summoned as well, protecting the player's cards from destruction and banishing the opponent's cards. Before locking itself into WATER monsters with the effects of "Revealer" and "Mirror Magic Master", the player can also make use of "[[Baronne de Fleur]]", another Level 10 Synchro Monster that can negate the opponent's cards.

  ===Tips===
  * "[[Icejade Ran Aegirine]]" is a perfect addition for the Deck, since it can [[Synchro Summon]] "[[Lancea, Dragonic Ancestor of the Ice Spirit Mountain]]" (or another Level 10 [[WATER]] [[Synchro Monster]]) by simply discarding another [[WATER]] monster to Summon itself and an "[[Icejade Token]]".
  * The one-card combo involving "[[Revealer of the Ice Barrier]]" to Summon "Lancea, Dragonic Ancestor of the Ice Spirit Mountain" and "[[Adamancipator Risen - Dragite]]" Summons "Lancea" as its [[List of unofficial terms#5th Summon|5th Summon]], thus allowing the player to Summon and use "[[Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]" if the opponent uses "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]".
  * While "Revealer of the Ice Barrier" is often the Deck's starter, it can be quite useful to use "[[Hexa Spirit of the Ice Barrier]]" + either "[[Georgius, Swordsman of the Ice Barrier]]" or "[[Speaker for the Ice Barriers]]" instead. This can result in the same combo as using only "Revealer", but does not lock the player into WATER monsters (until "Mirror Magic Master" is used), thus allowing the player to Summon "[[Baronne de Fleur]]" before commiting to the effect of "[[Mirror Magic Master of the Ice Barrier]]".
  ** When doing so, "Mirror Magic Master" can use itself and a Token to Synchro Summon "[[Coral Dragon]]" to the [[Extra Monster Zone]], allowing "Speaker" to banish itself to Summon another Token, and then Synchro Summon "[[Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys]]", drawing 1 card from "Coral Dragon" and 3 from "Archethys".
  * It is important to remember that "Lancea, Dragonic Ancestor of the Ice Spirit Mountain" is ''not'' an "Ice Barrier" monster. As such, lockdown effects that require the player to control another "Ice Barrier" monster (such as "[[Warlock of the Ice Barrier]]") still require the player to Summon another "Ice Barrier" monster before being applied.
  * If the player has both "Revealer of the Ice Barrier" and "Speaker for the Ice Barriers" in hand, they can Summon "Hexa Spirit of the Ice Barrier", Summon "Speaker" from the hand and make "[[Bahamut Shark]]" and "[[Toadally Awesome]]" as their 5th Summon. After doing so, "Hexa" can dump "[[Mirror Magic Master of the Ice Barrier]]" as usual, searching "Georgius", and "Bahamut Shark" and "Hexa" can be used to [[Link Summon]] "[[Marincess Coral Anemone]]" to Summon "Mirror Magic Master" from the GY. This allows the usual "Mirror Magic Master" combo, and saves "Georgius" to be used at the end of the combo.
  * The Tokens Summoned by "Mirror Magic Master" are a great way to activate "[[Winds Over the Ice Barrier]]", trading them for several Main Deck "Ice Barrier" monsters. Among them, "[[Spellbreaker of the Ice Barrier]]" can be particularly useful, since its effect won't work if Summoned by "Lancea".

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Unless the player has opened with multiple extenders, negating "[[Revealer of the Ice Barrier]]" or "[[Hexa Spirit of the Ice Barrier]]" can often end their turn on the spot.
  * Since all of the Deck's removal options are on their [[Extra Deck]], locking them out of it with cards such as "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" or "[[Vanity's Fiend]]" can prevent the player from establishing their board.
  * The Deck has no archetypal Spells/Traps to negate cards. As such, "[[Dark Ruler No More]]" and "[[Forbidden Droplet]]" can often deal with an "Ice Barrier" board.
  * "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" can be used if the player activates "[[Medallion of the Ice Barrier]]". This will prevent the search effect of "[[Mirror Magic Master of the Ice Barrier]]", and will most likely make their end board a lot weaker.
  * "[[Gozen Match]]" will prevent the player from Summoning more than 1 "Ice Barrier" monster.
