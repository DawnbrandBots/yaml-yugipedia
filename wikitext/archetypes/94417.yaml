  "'''R-Genex'''", short for "'''Real Genex'''" (レアル・ジェネクス, ''Rearu Jenekusu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is a sub-[[archetype]] of the "[[Genex]]" archetype, serving as [[support]] cards. Their [[Monster effect|effects]] are based on [[Special Summon]]ing more "R-Genex" and "Genex" monsters onto the [[field]], thus allowing any "Genex" Deck to [[swarm]] and [[Synchro Summon]] quickly.
  Running a completely pure "R-Genex" Deck is close to impossible, due to very little support, a lack of any powerful monsters and effects that support the "Genex" archetype more than themselves. A few "R-Genex" monsters are a welcome addition in "Genex" Decks, helping to increase the speed of the Deck and adding much-needed swarm power. The prime example is "[[R-Genex Accelerator]]", which allows you to [[Special Summon]] a "Genex" monster added from the Deck to the hand. Many [[Draw a card|draw]]/search cards can make a reasonably fast swarm for a relatively easy Synchro Summon.
