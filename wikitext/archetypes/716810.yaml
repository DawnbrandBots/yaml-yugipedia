  "'''Spright'''" (スプライト ''Supuraito'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]]/[[Rank]]/[[Link Rating|Link]]-2 [[DARK]] and [[FIRE]] [[Thunder]] monsters introduced in ''[[Power of the Elements]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 01: The Decisive Battle of the Northern Land}}

  == Etymology ==
  [[wikipedia:Sprite (folklore)|Sprites]] are fairy-like creatures in European folklore, similar to the [[wikipedia:Spriggan|Spriggan]] that the closely-related "[[Springans]]" archetype is based on.

  In particular, the "Spright" monsters are based on [[wikipedia:Sprite (lightning)|sprites]] (also called red sprites), an upper-atmospheric electrical phenomena named after the fairy due to their elusive nature. Other similar upper-atmospheric electrical phenomena are [[wikipedia:Upper-atmospheric lightning#Blue jets|blue jets]], [[wikipedia:Upper-atmospheric lightning#ELVES|ELVES]], and [[wikipedia:Upper-atmospheric lightning#Pixies|pixies]].

  == Design ==
  "Spright" monsters resemble humanoid beings made of pure plasma. The [[DARK]] monsters are made of blue plasma, while the [[FIRE]] monsters are made of red plasma.

  The "Spright" archetype also has a sci-fi theme, likely a reference to the proximity of [[wikipedia:Upper-atmospheric lightning|transient luminous events (TLE)]] to outer space. The majority of "Spright" monsters wear modern-style clothing, and several monsters use tools or equipment that resemble [[wikipedia:Satellite|artificial satellites]] or [[wikipedia:Unidentified flying object|UFOs]].

  [[Main Deck]] "Spright" monsters have zodiacal symbols marked on their attire or equipment. This indicates a relationship between the "Sprights", the "[[Therion]]", and the "[[Springans]]" archetypes. Additionally, the effect of "[[Spright Smashers]]" also implies a connection between the 3 archetypes.

  == Playing style ==
  "Spright" is an archetype centered on supporting [[Level]]/[[Rank]]/[[Link Rating|Link]]-2 monsters. Each [[Main Deck]] "Spright" monster can [[Special Summon]] themselves from the [[hand]] [[once per turn]], if the player [[control]]s either a Level 2 monster (all "Spright" monsters), a Rank 2 monster ([[DARK]] "Spright" monsters), or a Link-2 monster ([[FIRE]] "Spright" monsters). Each Main Deck "Spright" monster also has a second beneficial once per turn effect; either [[search]]ing monsters and [[Spell]]s/[[Trap]]s on summon ("[[Spright Blue]]", "[[Spright Jet]]"), providing effect negations ("[[Spright Carrot]]", "[[Spright Red]]"), or gaining [[ATK]]/[[DEF]] ("[[Spright Pixies]]").

  "Spright" Extra Deck monsters, rather than being boss monsters with field control effects (a role the deck primarily delegates to its Main Deck monsters with negate effects), are instead primarily resource points that support card searching and cycling.
  * "[[Gigantic Spright]]" can summon any Level 2 monster from the Deck.
  * "[[Spright Sprind]]" can send any Level 2 monster to the GY, and can conditionally [[List of unofficial terms#bounce|bounce]] a monster.
  * "[[Spright Elf]]" can revive any Level 2, or conditionally Rank/Link-2 monster from the GY as a Quick Effect.

  "Spright" Spell/Trap Cards provide additional extension ("[[Spright Starter]]"), stat boost ("[[Spright Gamma Burst]]"), and removal/interruption ("[[Spright Smashers]]", "[[Spright Double Cross]]"). The deck's main deck building restriction comes from the [[xenolock]]ing applied by the summon-from-deck searchers "[[Spright Starter]]" and "[[Gigantic Spright]]", who lock the player into only being able to Special Summon Level/Rank/Link-2 monsters.

  Taken together, the "Spright" Deck aims to swarm the field with large amounts of Level 2 monsters, use them to make generic Rank/Link-2 Extra Deck boss monsters, and control the board with these generic boss monsters and the in-engine negates ("[[Spright Carrot]]", "[[Spright Red]]") and interruption ("[[Spright Smashers]]", "[[Spright Double Cross]]").

  Externally, common Level 2 swarming engines used by "Spright" include:
  * [[Frog]]/[[Toad]] engine
  * "[[Deep Sea Diva]]" engine
  * "[[Nimble]]" engine
  * [[Live☆Twin]]/[[Evil★Twin]] engine
  * "[[Runick]]" engine
