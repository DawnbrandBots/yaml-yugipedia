  "'''Spright'''" (スプライト ''Supuraito'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]]/[[Rank]]/[[Link Rating|Link]]-2 [[DARK]] and [[FIRE]] [[Thunder]] monsters introduced in ''[[Power of the Elements]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 01: The Decisive Battle of the Northern Land}}

  == Etymology ==
  [[wikipedia:Sprite (folklore)|Sprites]] are fairy-like creatures in European folklore, similar to the [[wikipedia:Spriggan|Spriggan]] that the closely-related "[[Springans]]" archetype is based on.

  In particular, the "Spright" monsters are based on [[wikipedia:Sprite (lightning)|sprites]] (also called red sprites), an upper-atmospheric electrical phenomena named after the fairy due to their elusive nature. Other similar upper-atmospheric electrical phenomena are [[wikipedia:Upper-atmospheric lightning#Blue jets|blue jets]], [[wikipedia:Upper-atmospheric lightning#ELVES|ELVES]], and [[wikipedia:Upper-atmospheric lightning#Pixies|pixies]].

  == Design ==
  "Spright" monsters resemble humanoid beings made of pure plasma. The [[DARK]] monsters are made of blue plasma, while the [[FIRE]] monsters are made of red plasma.

  The "Spright" archetype also has a sci-fi theme, likely a reference to the proximity of [[wikipedia:Upper-atmospheric lightning|transient luminous events (TLE)]] to outer space. The majority of "Spright" monsters wear modern-style clothing, and several monsters use tools or equipment that resemble [[wikipedia:Satellite|artificial satellites]] or [[wikipedia:Unidentified flying object|UFOs]].

  [[Main Deck]] "Spright" monsters have zodiacal symbols marked on their attire or equipment. This indicates a relationship between the "Sprights", the "[[Therion]]", and the "[[Springans]]" archetypes. Additionally, the effect of "[[Spright Smashers]]" also implies a connection between the 3 archetypes.

  == Playing style ==
  "Spright" is an archetype centered on supporting [[Level]]/[[Rank]]/[[Link Rating|Link]]-2 monsters. Each [[Main Deck]] "Spright" monster can [[Special Summon]] themselves from the [[hand]] [[once per turn]], if the player [[control]]s either a Level 2 monster (all "Spright" monsters), a Rank 2 monster ([[DARK]] "Spright" monsters), or a Link-2 monster ([[FIRE]] "Spright" monsters). Each Main Deck "Spright" monster also has a second beneficial once per turn effect; either [[search]]ing monsters and [[Spell]]s/[[Trap]]s, providing effect negations, or gaining [[ATK]]/[[DEF]].

  The primary boss monsters of the theme are "[[Gigantic Spright]]" and "[[Spright Elf]]". "Spright Elf" is a Link-2 FIRE [[Thunder]] [[Link Monster]] that offers protection to the cards it [[points to]] and can Special Summon a Level 2 monster from the [[GY]] or, if the opponent controls a monster at activation, a Rank/Link-2 monster. "Gigantic Spright" is a Rank 2 DARK [[Thunder]] [[Xyz Monster]] that can be Xyz Summoned using Link-2 monsters the player controls as [[material]]s, and can Special Summon a Level 2 monster from the Deck, making it an Extra Deck starter for various Level 2-related engines; such as the "[[Frog]]" engine.

  "Spright" Spell Cards round out the playstyle by providing additional extension, stat boosts, and [[Quick Effect]] removal. "[[Spright Smashers]]" also acts as support for the "[[Springans]]" and "[[Therion]]" archetypes by offering forms of extension and revival for each archetype respectively and promotes potential blending of "Spright" with these themes.

  Two of the archetype's key cards, "[[Spright Starter]]" and "[[Gigantic Spright]]", both apply a Special Summoning lock to the player after their effect resolves, forcing the player into only being able to Special Summon Level/Rank/Link-2 monsters, limiting the player's Deck building and combo options. Notably, the restriction effect of "Giantic Spright" is also applied to the opponent; as a [[Spell Speed 1]] effect, this cannot be used as a disruption, but it can provide some protection against the opponent's Quick Effects in the player's turn, such as them using "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]".
