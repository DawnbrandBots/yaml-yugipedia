  "'''Puppet'''" (パペット ''Papetto'') is an [[archetype]] of [[monster]]s used by [[Reiko Kitamori]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! R]]'' manga and [[Quattro]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime.

  The first and only support for the "Puppet" archetype is "[[Promotion]]", which was released in ''[[Premium Pack 2022]]''. The only monsters supported by "Promotion" are [[EARTH]] [[Warrior]] "Puppet" monsters, which are specifically the [[wikipedia:Chess|chess]]-themed "Puppet" monsters used by Reiko Kitamori.

  While several other "Puppet" cards are also technically part of this archetype, such as "[[Gimmick Puppet]]s" (which were used by Quattro), they are not supported by any of this archetype's support cards, due to not being EARTH Warrior monsters.

  ==Members==
  The intended members of the "Puppet" archetype in the card game (i.e. Reiko Kitamori's EARTH Warrior "Puppet" monsters) are each based on a [[wikipedia:Chess|chess]] piece.

  Additionally, the card text of the manga version of "[[Promotion (manga)|Promotion]]" mentions the existence of a "[[Puppet Bishop]]" (based on the [[wikipedia:Bishop (chess)|Bishop]]) and a "[[Puppet Knight]]" (based on the [[wikipedia:Knight (chess)|Knight]]), but they never appeared in the manga and have not been released in the ''OCG''.

  The archetype's sole support card, "[[Promotion]]", is based on the [[wikipedia:Promotion (chess)|promotion]] mechanic in chess.
