  "'''Evil★Twin'''" (イビルツイン ''Ibiru Tsuin'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] and [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] [[monster]]s which debuted in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Genesis Impactors]]''. They share members with the "[[Ki-sikil]]" and "[[Lil-la]]" archetypes, and are also supported by the "[[Live☆Twin]]" archetype.
  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX card storylines#No. 04: Live☆Twin & Evil★Twin}}
  ==Etymology==
  Their name is likely a reference to [[wikipedia:Evil twin (wireless networks)|evil twin wireless networks]], a fraudulent Wi-Fi access point that appears to be legitimate but is set up to eavesdrop on wireless communications, usually to steal the passwords of unsuspecting users, either by monitoring their connections or by phishing, which involves setting up a fraudulent web site and luring people there.
  They also have a [[wikipedia:Palindrome#Semordnilap|play on the words]] ''evil'' and ''live'', with the "Evil★" cards showing the real characters and the "Live☆" cards showing their digital personas.
  ==Design==
  The "Evil★Twin" and "Live☆Twin" archetypes are inspired by [[wikipedia:VTuber|VTuber]] online entertainers. The "Live☆Twin" monsters are the online appearances of "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la", where they are comedic entertainers, while the "Evil★Twin" monsters are the real appearances of "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la", who are [[wikipedia:Gentleman thief|phantom thieves]]. The ''[[wikipedia:Chibi (slang)|chibi]]'' art styles of the "Live☆Twins" appear to be inspired by anime and cartoon shows such as ''[[wikipedia:Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt|Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi|Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi]]''.
  The individual names of "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la" are a reference to "Ki-sikil-lil-la-ke", a Sumerian night-demon, who was possibly the origin of the name [[wikipedia:Lilith|Lilith]].
  "[[Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny]]" depicts a rival entertainment duo to "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la", who are named as Luna and Sunny in lore.
  ===Members===
  There are three pairs of "[[Ki-sikil]]" and "[[Lil-la]]" monsters across the "Live☆Twin" and "Evil★Twin" archetypes.

  ==Playing style==
  The playstyle of "Evil★Twin" revolves around using the effects of "[[Ki-sikil]]" and "[[Lil-la]]" monsters to Summon their opposite counterparts, in order to link climb, maintain field presence, and accumulate card advantage. There are three pairs of "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la" monsters across the "Live☆Twin" and "Evil★Twin" archetype, each with their own pattern of effects:
  * "Live☆Twin": Consisting of "[[Live☆Twin Ki-sikil]]" and "[[Live☆Twin Lil-la]]", these are the Main Deck 1-card starters for the archetype. They can Special Summon their opposite "Twin" when Normal or Special Summoned while you control no other monsters.
  * Holiday "Live☆Twin": Consisting of "[[Live☆Twin Ki-sikil Frost]]" and "[[Live☆Twin Lil-la Treat]]", they serve as backup extenders in the hand and have situational GY effects. They can Special Summon themselves from hand if you control their opposite "Twin" monster.
  * "Evil★Twin": Consisting of "[[Evil★Twin Ki-sikil]]" and "[[Evil★Twin Lil-la]]", these are the main LINK-2 Link Monsters that serve as the main board presence and advantage generator for the archetype. They both have a [[Quick Effect]] to Special Summon their other "Twin" from the GY (also locking the player into only being able to Special Summon Fiend monsters from the Extra Deck for the turn), and both have a [[Trigger Effect]] that occurs when they're Special Summoned while you control the opposite "Twin" ("Ki-sikil" draws a card while "Lil-la" destroys a card on field).
  The ability for "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la" monsters to Special Summon the other allows them to easily Link climb from one "Live☆Twin" monster into a pair of LINK-2 "Evil★Twin" monsters, and from there one LINK-4 Fiend monster. The archetype's main boss monster (released in later waves of supports) is one such monster, "[[Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny]]". "Sunny" can, as a Quick Effect, Tribute itself to Special Summon both "Evil★Twin Ki-sikil" and "Evil★Twin Lil-la" from the Graveyard; doing so triggers both of their trigger effects, allowing a draw and a card pop. On the subsequent turn, the two "Evil★Twin" monsters' Trigger Effects can be easily triggered again (by using them as Link Materials and then reviving them) to gain more card advantage.
  With this in mind, the goal of "Evil★Twins" revolves around being able to continuously use and reuse the Trigger Effects of "[[Evil★Twin Ki-sikil]]" and "[[Evil★Twin Lil-la]]", in both the player's and the opponent's turn, to repeatedly draw cards and pop cards and overwhelm the opponent in card advantage. The archetype's ability to start their entire combo from 1 card and repeated card draws means that much of the deck can be filled with non-archetypal power cards and staples, such as [[hand trap]]s and [[trap card]]s.
  The deck has one additional power play in the form of the Level 8 boss monster "[[Evil★Twins Ki-sikil & Lil-la]]", which can be Special Summoned from the hand or Graveyard by Tributing any 2 Link Monsters, forces the opponent send cards from their field to the Graveyard until they are left with only 2 cards, and gains 2200 ATK while a "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la" monster are in the GY, leaving this monster with a menacing 4400 ATK. "Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny" can mill the monster to the Graveyard as a part of its Graveyard effect, enabling an easy Special Summon of the monster.
  To help support this playstyle, the "Live☆Twin" Spells and Spell Card "[[Secret Password]]" can help get "Live☆Twin" monsters to the hand/field while the "Evil★Twin" Traps focus on disrupting the opponent in one way or another.
  Because of the limits imposed on the Extra Deck ''after'' using their revival effects, the Deck seems limited at first, but has many routes it can take when being built. Due to the original "Live☆Twin" monsters being [[Cyberse]], a "[[Code Talker]]" variant can be made to focus on making "[[Decode Talker Heatsoul]]" before beginning any "Evil★Twin" plays to add additional draw support and resources. The effect of "Lil-la" to destroy a card when she is Special Summoned makes "[[Unchained]]" a very popular variant of the Deck as you can enable your "Unchained" Spells and Traps and introduce further disruption in tangent with "[[Unchained Abomination]]". "[[Knightmare]]" monsters are also a staple due to the Fiend limitation, the Deck works well with "[[Knightmare Gryphon]]" in particular. Another popular variant involves the "[[Eldlich]]" theme as that deck focuses more on Main Deck plays than Extra Deck ones, allowing for a solid control variant.

  ==Weakness==
  * While "Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny" provides good interruption during the opponent's turn, mass removal cards such as "[[Raigeki]]" or "[[Lightning Storm]]" can prove troublesome for the deck, as even if player tributed "Sunny" in response to the activation, the effects of "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la" summoned by "Sunny's" effect will not activate upon chain resolution before both were destroyed, leaving the player vulnerable to opponent's counterplay.
