  {{Quote|“In this world, there is a massive crystal embedded in the center of a great mountain range. An entire crystal domain extends forth from it in every direction, changing everything that’s touched by it into the same type of crystal, the crystal rot doesn’t just affect the environment either. It spreads to animals and other lifeforms within the domain of the great crystal, transforming them into an entire new being.

  Is it a natural disaster or something else? Whatever it is, the creatures it’s altered continue to roam free. The rot continues to spread and something else seems to be forming within the domain as well. At the center of it all lies something that has become known as the Crystal God Tistina, and all who gaze upon its form marvel at its beauty and experience true fear.”|source=Yu-Gi-Oh!

  "'''Tistina'''" is an [[archetype]] of [[Aqua]] monsters of various different [[Attribute]]s and [[Level]]s introduced in ''[[Duelist Nexus]]''.

  ==Design==
  Design-wise, the "Tistina" monsters carry a shared theme of crystalized organisms of different shapes and forms resembling animals and other creatures. Presumably, the cause of these organisms is due to the reaching influence of "[[Crystal God Tistina]]" changing its surroundings and even the animals and other lifeforms into fellow "Tistina" monsters to spread its rot and influence even further.

  ==Playing style==
  "Tistina" is a theme focused on controlling the board state through the effects of its main [[Level]] 10 boss monsters; "[[Crystal God Tistina]]" and "[[Demigod of the Tistina]]". Both monsters are able to change as many monsters the opponent controls to [[Face-down|face-down]] [[Defense Position]], followed by sending all remaining [[Face-up|face-up]] cards they control to the [[Graveyard|GY]]; a powerful effect that removes any [[Link Monster]] or face-up [[Spell Card]] or [[Trap Card]] the opponent controls upon resolution. This is supported by the lower-Level monsters of the theme, "[[Sentinel of the Tistina]]" and "[[Hound of the Tistina]]", with "Sentinel" being able to search "Tistina" cards and "Hound" allowing "Tistina" monsters to [[Direct attack|directly attack]] the opponent while they control a face-down Defense Position monster. Both "Sentinel" and "Hound" also share the effect to [[Special Summon]] themselves from the hand or GY if you control a [[LIGHT]] "Tistina" monster, allowing for easier access to the smaller monsters to utilize their effects.

  While "Demigod" has an effect to Special Summon itself from the hand, the primary way to Special Summon "Crystal God Tistina" is through the effect of their Field Spell; "[[Divine Domain Baatistina]]". This card is able to [[Send|send]] 1 "Tistina" monster from the Deck to the GY, then if the opponent controls 3 or more face-up cards, the player can Special Summon "Crystal God Tistina" from the hand or Deck. "Baatistina" is also capable of Special Summoning any "Tistina" monster from the Deck or GY if destroyed while in the [[Field Zone]] by the opponent's card effect.

  All together, the theme's core playing style is to go second using various powerful effects to lock down the opponent and attack over their face-down monsters with an amassed collection of various "Tistina" monsters.
