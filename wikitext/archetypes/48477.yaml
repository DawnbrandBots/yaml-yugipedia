  "'''Genex'''" (ジェネクス ''Jenekusu'') is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with various [[Attribute]]s (primarily [[DARK]]) introduced in ''[[Limited Edition 13]]'' in the ''[[OCG]]'' and in ''[[Duel Terminal 1]]'' in the ''[[TCG]]''. 

  Most of members' effects involves [[add]]ing monsters from the [[Deck]] to the [[hand]] and [[Special Summon]] them, as well as using "[[Genex Controller]]" with low-[[Level]] monsters of the four basic [[Attribute]]s for [[Synchro Summon]]. The name of "Genex" [[Synchro Monster]]s are based on sources of energy such as [[Hydro Genex|hydroelectric]], [[Geo Genex|geothermal]], [[Genex Solar|solar]], etc.

  A sub-archetype, "[[R-Genex]]", was added in ''[[Duel Terminal - Justice Strikes Back!!|Justice Strikes Back!!]]'', ''[[Duel Terminal - Champion of Chaos!!|Champion of Chaos!!]]'' and ''[[Duel Terminal - Charge of the Genex!!|Charge of the Genex!!]]''.

  ==Playing style==
  The classic playstyle of the "Genex" archetype uses "[[Genex Controller]]" to achieve various effects and perform Synchro Summons, "R-Genex" focuses on assisting the Special Summon of "Genex" and "R-Genex" monsters for swarming, and "Genex Ally" focuses on manipulating the six Attributes to achieve different effects.

  The modern playstyle is entirely dependent on the [[Link Monster]] "[[Repaired Genex Controller]]". Thanks to its effect, the player can [[Normal Summon]] a "Genex" monster each time a "Genex" monster is added to their hand, at the cost of not being able to [[Special Summon]] from their [[Extra Deck]], except [[Synchro Monster]]s by using only "Genex" Tuners. However, it does not restrict which Synchro Monsters can be Summoned, allowing the player to gather a multitude of monsters to be used as material for powerful generic Synchro Monsters, such as "[[Baronne de Fleur]]" and "[[Adamancipator Risen - Dragite]]".

  "Repaired Genex Controller" is played alongside "[[R-Genex Turbo]]", "[[Genex Power Planner]]", "[[R-Genex Magma]]", and "[[R-Genex Crusher]]". Not only each of them can be used as the sole material to Link Summon it, but each can search the other when they are Normal Summoned, triggering the effect of "Repaired Genex Controller" and rapidly gathering monsters to be used as material. Since the effect of "Repaired Genex Controller" is applied immediately after adding a monster, it is important to Summon a "Genex" Tuner before running out of Main Monster Zones. After doing so, the player can use that "Genex" Tuner and as many of the "Genex" monsters as they want in order to Synchro Summon.

  After performing a Synchro Summon, the player has several methods to "restart" the Summon chain that "Repaired Genex Controller" allows. One such method is to return a "Genex" monster from the field to the hand with "[[Genex Ally Birdman]]". By doing so, the returned "Genex" monster can be instantly Normal Summoned again, and repeat the Summon chain again. Other methods to return cards from the field to the hand, such as "[[Dewloren, Tiger King of the Ice Barrier]]" and "[[Merry Melffys]]", are also available to the player.

  "[[R-Genex Undine]]" is another important tool to "restart" the Summon chain. It can be sent to the [[GY]] by "[[Genex Undine]]" (which also searches "Genex Controller"), and from there, it can add itself and another "Genex" monster to the hand, at the cost of [[banish]]ing any card the player sends to their GY for the rest of the turn. This, combined with the second effect of "R-Genex Undine" to treat itself as a Tuner, can usually lead to at least another Synchro Monsters if the player has enough space on board.

  When available, the starters can be used to search a "Genex" Tuner instead. "Genex Power Planner" can search "Genex Ally Birdman". "R-Genex Turbo" can search "[[R-Genex Oracle]]", a Level 1 Tuner that can Special Summon itself when added to the hand. "R-Genex Magma" can search "[[R-Genex Turing]]", a Level 2 Tuner which can not only treat itself as Level 1 or 3, but can also Summon itself from the player's hand during the opponent's turn and perform a Synchro Summon.

  By using all these different "Genex" monsters to perform the Summon chain, the player can also make the best use of the archetype's boss monster, "[[Arms of Genex Return Zero]]". It has a powerful effect that can [[negate]] the activation and destroy up to 6 of the opponent's monsters by banishing a monster from the GY with that corresponding [[Attribute]], but only once for each Attribute. This can effectively shut down Decks that rely on monsters of different Attributes to make their plays, even if they are generic [[Extra Deck]] monsters or [[hand trap]]s. Finally, its second effect can shuffle up to 6 of the player's "Genex" monsters with different Attributes that are in the GY or banished, and [[destroy]] up to that many number of Spells & Traps on the field.

  Among their other cards, "Genex" also have "[[Locomotion R-Genex]]", which can take control of an opponent's monster when Synchro Summoned. Not only does it not [[target]], but it also works during the opponent's turn thanks to "R-Genex Turing". "[[Genex Ally Axel]]", a Synchro Monster that also requires a "Genex" Tuner, can Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Machine monster back from the GY, allowing for even more Synchro Summons.

  ===Tips===
  * Since it is vital to resolve the effect of "[[Repaired Genex Controller]]", cards such as "[[Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended]]", "[[Link into the VRAINS!]]" and "[[Crossout Designator]]" are recommended in order to protect it.
  * "[[PSY-Framelord Omega]]" is a great choice to Synchro Summon, since it can banish itself and a card from the opponent's hand. Not only this reduces the opponent's resources, but it also opens more zones for the player to use.
  * Among the starters, "[[Genex Power Planner]]" is usually one of the best options to return from the field to the hand, since it can search both "[[Genex Ally Birdman]]" and "[[Genex Undine]]", important pieces to finish the player's combos.
  * If the player already controls a "Genex" monster, "[[R-Genex Turing]]" can Summon itself during the opponent's turn alongside a "[[Bystial]]" monster (such as "[[Bystial Druiswurm]]"). This is a great method to Summon Synchro Monsters that have effects when Synchro Summoned, such as "[[Locomotion R-Genex]]" and "[[Black Rose Dragon]]".
