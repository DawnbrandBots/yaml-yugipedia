  "'''Yubel'''" (ユベル ''Yuberu'') is an [[archetype]] of 0 [[ATK]]/[[DEF]] [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] monsters that are all based on the various forms of [[Yubel|the card with the same name]]. All of them were used by the [[Yubel (character)|Duel Monster Spirit, Yubel]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. While the "Yubel" archetype was minimally supported in the anime by the anime version of "[[Neos Wiseman (anime)|Neos Wiseman]]", it was not officially supported as an archetype in the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'' until ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]''. ''OCG''/''TCG'' support for the "Yubel" archetype featured [[card evolutions|retrained versions]] of cards that were used by the Yubel character in the anime, specifically during their [[duel]] against [[Jaden Yuki]] in episodes [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Episode 153|153]], [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Episode 154|154]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX - Episode 155|155]].

  ==Playing style==
  "Yubel" monsters share the common effect that they cannot be [[destroy]]ed by [[battle]] and the controller does not take any [[battle damage]] from battles involving them. Also, when an [[Attack Position]] "Yubel" monster is attacked by an opponent's monster, before [[damage calculation]], they take damage equal to that monster's ATK. When using the more powerful monsters of the archetype, the latter effect also triggers when the "Yubel" monster battles and is also able to remove the opponent's battling monster from the field. 

  The archetype's original strategy was to have the original "Yubel" monsters being destroyed which triggered their effects that trigger to Special Summon the more powerful forms of "[[Yubel]]"; destroying the original "Yubel" allows the Special Summon of "[[Yubel - Terror Incarnate]]", which can destroy other monsters on the field during each turn. Making "Terror Incarnate" leave the field enables "[[Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare]]" to be Summoned, which can battle an opponent's monster, inflict damage and destroy them. The effects of "Yubel" monsters discouraged the opponent from trying to deal with them by battle, let alone Summoning their monsters in the first place, making them useful for [[stall]]ing. However, the strategy was not a threat throughout the game's history due to the limited number of viable choices that could Summon the original three "Yubel" monsters. "The Ultimate Nightmare" lacks additional protection or a floating effect upon its destruction, forcing the player to go through the original "Yubel" and "Terror Incarnate" again in order to Special Summon "The Ultimate Nightmare" again.

  In ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]'', the archetype has received its first wave of support that aided the archetype's original strategy. "[[Samsara Regenerating Lotus]]" can Tribute itself to Special Summon a "Yubel" monster from the Deck while if left alone on the field, it can make any monster effect into destroying a "Yubel" monster on the field, making it easier to trigger the destruction effects of the "Yubel" monsters. It is able to recur itself from the GY to make use of its effects constantly each turn. "[[Geist Grinder Golem]]" can reveal a "Yubel" monster to Special Summon itself to the opponent's field while Special Summoning the revealed monster. If "Geist Grinder Golem" battles its opponent's "Yubel", the opponent (mainly the card's original owner) gains 3000 LP. While both of these monsters can Special Summon the original "Yubel", the optimal "Yubel" monster to Special Summon is "[[Spirit of Yubel]]", which upon being Special Summoned, it can search a Spell/Trap card that mentions "Yubel". Upon its destruction, "Spirit of Yubel" can also Special Summon the original "Yubel".

  "[[Nightmare Pain]]" can destroy a DARK monster to add another support card for "Yubel" (thus triggering the destruction effects of "Yubel" monsters) and force all of the opponent's monsters to attack a "Yubel" monster. It also makes the opponent take battle damage from battles involving "Yubel" monsters which is independent of the "Yubel" monsters' shared effects of inflicting effect damage when they are attacked/battled, essentially making the opponent take damage double of their monster's ATK. "[[Mature Chronicle]]" makes use of Chronicle Counters earned from Special Summoning "Yubel" or its related monsters to either revive "Yubel", recur a banished card, banish a card from the Deck, destroy a card on the field, or even search "[[Super Polymerization]]". The archetype features a new boss [[Fusion Monster]], "[[Yubel - Das Ewig Liebe Wächter]]", whose generic materials makes it a prime choice for [[Fusion Summon]]ing with "[[Eternal Favorite]]" or "Super Polymerization" to clear away the opponent's monsters. It now gains effect destruction immunity in addition to battle destruction immunity and upon battling an opponent's monster, it can banish said monster after damaging them.

  One method to quickly Fusion Summon "Yubel - Das Ewig Liebe Wächter" by using the opponent's monsters requires only "Samsara Regenerating Lotus" and any other card in hand. "Samsara Regenerating Lotus" can Tribute itself to Special Summon "Spirit of Yubel" from the Deck, which can add "Nightmare Pain" to the hand. Next, "Nightmare Pain" can destroy "Spirit of Yubel" to add "Eternal Favorite" to the hand, while triggering "Spirit of Yubel" to Summon the original "Yubel" from the Deck. After Setting "Eternal Favorite", "Samsara Regenerating Lotus" can Special Summon itself during the [[End Phase]], and be Tributed by "Yubel" to keep itself on the field. At any moment during the opponent's turn, "Eternal Favorite" can be activated by [[discard]]ing a card and Fusion Summon "Yubel - Das Ewig Liebe Wächter" using "Yubel" and all of the opponent's monsters.

  While various staples can send "Yubel" monsters to the GY in preparation of Special Summoning them later, the most notable outsider cards for supporting the archetype's playstyle are "[[Dark Beckoning Beast]]" and "[[Opening of the Spirit Gates]]", which is able to revive "Yubel" or "Spirit of Yubel" and return a [[Continuous Spell]] from the GY to the hand (such as "Nightmare Pain" and "Mature Chronicle") while the player controls a Level 10 monster.

  === Official Decks ===
  A Deck that combines "Yubel" and "Madolche", and makes use of "[[Madolche Fresh Sistart]]" from "LINK VRAINS PACK".

  "Yubel – Terror Incarnate" destroys all monsters on the field except itself, while "Madolche Fresh Sistart", on the field, can return a "Madolche" monster from your GY to the Deck to remain on the field.

  In tandem, you can activate "[[Madolche Ticket]]" to Special Summon "Madolche" to the field, so you can Sweep your opponent’s field each turn, while preserving your own field, making it a strong combination.<ref>https://ygorganization.com/thekeyingredientinthesesweetsarenightmares/</ref>

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Cards that negate effects such as "[[Rainbow Veil]]", "[[Skill Drain]]", "[[Light and Darkness Dragon]]", "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" and "[[Angel O7]]" pose serious problems for "Yubel"-based Decks, especially since all "Yubel" monsters have 0 ATK/DEF. "[[Destiny HERO - Plasma]]" will also negate the effects of "Yubel". Another card that will wreck a "Yubel" strategy is "[[Prime Material Dragon]]", which switches effect damage into increasing Life Points, as well as its effect to negate the destruction effect of "[[Yubel - Terror Incarnate]]" and destroy it. All 3 forms of "Yubel" are at risk with "Prime Material Dragon" in play. However, this card can also turn into an advantage to a "Yubel"-beck by taking over control of your opponent's "Prime Material Dragon" (or using an own one) to use its second effect to destroy the original form of "Yubel" just at the moment when "Yubel" would destroy itself in case you can't tribute a monster so you could easily summon "Yubel - Terror Incarnate" and performing the same tactic on the second form again to summon the final "Yubel" form. Getting rid of "Prime Material Dragon" afterwards shouldn't be that much of a big problem since it could be destroyed by several cards which are common to destroy/remove a monster from the field. 

  * Cards that would remove "Yubel" monsters from the field other than destroying them, such as "[[Number 50: Blackship of Corn]]" and "[[D.D. Warrior Lady]]" can also pose a serious treat (though most of these effects will still trigger the effect of "Yubel - Terror Incarnate" to Special Summon "Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare"). 

  * As all "Yubel" Main Deck monsters are Level 10+ monsters and they do not have any useful effects while in the hand (aside from "Spirit of Yubel"), they become troublesome [[brick]]s if the user does not open with another card to make immediate use of them. Their high level also means that cards that prevent Special Summons are also troublesome to deal with since only the original "Yubel" and "Spirit of Yubel" can be Normal Summoned (each requiring 2 Tributes).
