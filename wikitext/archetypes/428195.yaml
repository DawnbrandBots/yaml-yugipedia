  "'''Battlewasp'''", known as "'''Bee Force'''" ({{Ruby|Ｂ・Ｆ|ビー・フォース}} ''Bī Fōsu'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[WIND]] [[Insect]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Shinji Weber]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime.
  ==Etymology==
  The Japanese name of "Bee Force", 「Ｂ・Ｆ」 is analogous to the Japanese name of "[[Blackwing]]", "Black Feather", also abbreviated 「ＢＦ」, which emphasizes the friendship between Shinji and [[Crow Hogan (ARC-V)|Crow Hogan]]. The English name reflects this with the initials of both archetypes' localized names being "'''BW'''".

  Individually, the [[Level 2]] or lower monsters are based on ranged projectiles, such as needles, pins, and darts, while the [[Level 3]] or higher monsters are based on piercing weapons, such as the [[wikipedia:Halberd|halberd]] and ranged weapons including [[wikipedia:Arbalest|arbalests]] and [[wikipedia:Ballista|ballistae]].

  ==Playing style==
  The "Battlewasp" archetype tends to focus on very typical for bugs [[swarm]]ing tactics to perform quick [[Synchro Summon]]s and overwhelm the opponent with [[ATK]]/[[DEF]] decreasing and burn effects. Furthermore, they seem to revolve around "numbers" - the more "Battlewasp" monsters you gather, the stronger their effects become, reflecting Shinji's mentality of union.
  "[[Battlewasp - Sting the Poison|Sting]]" begins the decks strategy by adding a "Battlewasp" to Hand from the Deck, while also carrying a [[Quick Effect]] that Negates the Effects of an Opponent's Monster. "[[Battlewasp - Twinbow the Attacker|Twinbow]]" is relatively simple in that it Special Summons itself from the Hand but locks the player to Insects for the rest of the turn. It can Attack Twice. "[[Battlewasp - Arbalest the Rapidfire|Arbalest]]" has the highest Attack of the Main Deck Battlewasps and Special Summons a Level 3 or Lower Insect from the [[Graveyard]] when it is Normal Summoned. When Destroyed by an Opponents card, it can Special Summon another "Battlewasp" from the Deck. [[Battlewasp - Pin the Bullseye|Pin]] can Special Summon itself while another Insect is on the Player's Field. It also can inflict 200 Damage for each "Pin the Bullseye" the Player controls. This burn trend continues with [[Battlewasp - Dart the Hunter]] which inflict the full attack of an Opponent's Monster Destroyed in Battle by a "Battlewasp". On the field it can also turn Insects into Tuners.
  The Synchro lineup consists of the Synchro Tuner "[[Battlewasp - Azusa the Ghost Bow]]" inflicts more damage when it sees a Battlewasp inflict effect damage and can revive itself when a Battlewasp Destroys a Monster in Battle. "[[Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge]]" halves a stronger Monster's Attack in Battle. It then inflicts effect Damage when it inflicts Battle Damage x 200 for each Battlewasp the Player controls. "[[Battlewasp - Hama the Conquering Bow|Hama]]" could be the end-game of the Deck, able to Attack twice when a Synchro Monster is used for its Synchro Summon. When it inflicts Battle Damage, the opponent's Monsters can lose 1000 ATK/DEF and if no Battle Damage has been inflicted at all, "Hama" can deal 300 for every "Battlewasp" in the Graveyard. "[[Battlewasp - Ballista the Armageddon]]" is the theme's boss being a Level 12 Synchro Monster. When summoned, it allows the Player to Banish all Insects in the GY to make the Opponent's Monsters lose attack, inflicts [[Piercing]] Battle Damage and if Destroyed by an Opponent's Card returns 3 of the Player's Banished Insects to the Field.
  "[[Revival Swarm]]" Special Summons Battlewasps from the Graveyard and can be Banished to provide proactive protection for an Insect Monster. "[[Summoning Swarm]]" is a "Battlewasp" exclusive version of "[[Soul Charge]]", but is unable to summon the Synchro Monsters, locks the Player to Insects from the Extra Deck and can only Summon up to the amount of Monsters their Opponent Controls. This leaves their Trap; "[[Battlewasp - Nest]]" which detects attacks on Battlewasps to Special Summon another from hte Hand or Deck before ending the Battle Phase. It also Destroys itself after this has been done twice.
  Being an Insect-based Deck, there is synergy with this theme and "[[Beetrooper]]"
  ==Weaknesses==
  Being Synchro based, this deck dislikes "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" and other cards that prevent or punish Synchro Summoning.
