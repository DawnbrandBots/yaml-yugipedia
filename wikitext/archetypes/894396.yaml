  "'''Purrely'''" (ピュアリィ ''Pyuaryi'') is an [[archetype]] of primarily [[LIGHT]] [[Fairy]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Amazing Defenders]]''/''[[Amazing Defenders]]''.

  == Etymology ==
  "Purrely" may be a portmanteau of "pure" and "fairy" while also playing on the word "purely."
  It may be a mix between "to Purr"
  and purely

  == Design ==
  "Purrely" monsters are feline-based creatures, with the Xyz monsters depicting the growth of the [[Purrely (card)|namesake]] monster into advanced forms of various elements. The Spell and Trap cards depicts what seems to be a photo of "Purrely" taken by its unseen owner.

  == Playing style ==
  "Purrely" is a theme focused on a Level 1 monster of the [[Purrely (card)|same name]] and stacking multiple materials onto its various archetypal [[Rank]] 2 [[Xyz Monster]]s. This is achieved through the monster "Purrely" and its effect to reveal a "Purrely" [[Quick-Play Spell Card]] from your hand and [[Special Summon]] a Xyz Monster which mentions that Quick-Play Spell in its text using "Purrely" and the revealed card as materials. Each of the Rank 2 "Purrely" Xyz Monsters has a unique effect that gains a bonus effect if it has a specific "Purrely" Quick-Play Spell as a material and each one shares the effect where, thrice per turn as a [[Quick Effect]], you can attach activated "Purrely" Quick-Play Spells to that monster as material with a bonus effect depending on the Rank 2 in question; from temporary removal of cards on the field to changing battle positions.

  | [[Epurrely Plump]]

  Their primary boss monster is [[Expurrely Happiness]], a Rank 7 Xyz Monster than can be Xyz Summoned using a Rank 2 Xyz Monster with 5 or more materials. "Expurrely Happiness" is a more aggressively focused monster in how it can negate the effects of all your opponent's monsters during your Main Phase and until the End Phase without being interrupted if it has a Level 1 "Purrely" monster as material as well as being able to inflict 1500 [[Burn Deck|burn]] damage when an attack is declared involving it while it has 5 or more materials. This is further helped by the 3 "Purrely" Quick-Play Spells granting bonus effects when used a material for a "Purrely" Xyz Monster; from multiple attacks to equipping more materials and even further stat gains.
