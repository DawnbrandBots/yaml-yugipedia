  "'''Dark World'''" ({{Ruby|暗|あん}}{{Ruby|黒|こく}}{{Ruby|界|かい}} ''Ankokukai'') is an [[archetype]] consisting of [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They were introduced in ''[[Elemental Energy]]'', with further support in ''[[Strike of Neos]]'', ''[[Gates of the Underworld Structure Deck]]'' and ''[[Primal Origin]]''.

  [[Brron, Mad King of Dark World (character)|Brron, Mad King of Dark World]] uses this archetype in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime.

  ==Naming==
  The names of "Dark World" monsters are mostly based on colors, many of which feature prominently in their artwork and their army positions. The English names are based on the words for the colors with either extra letters added/removed or corrupt spellings. The Japanese names are based on the transcriptions of the English words for the colors with one or more [[wikipedia:Mora (linguistics)|morae]] deleted. The Chinese names are combinations of the color names and [[wikipedia:Transcription into Chinese characters|transcription]]s/transliterations of English or Japanese words, in terms of phonetics.

  ==Playing style==
  "Dark World" cards are generally intended to gain advantage by [[Summon]]ing and [[destroy]]ing through [[discard]]ing cards (through effects) from your [[hand]]. Many "Dark World" monsters also gain extra effects if discarded by an opponent's effect. This does not include [[cost]]s that require the user to discard, such as "[[Lightning Vortex]]" or effects that send cards from the hand to the Graveyard, without discarding, such as "[[Hand Destruction]]". Monsters of this archetype can rapidly and aggressively [[swarm]] the [[field]] and overwhelm the opponent by destroying and discarding your opponent's cards. The deck's main boss monster, "[[Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World]]", has a built-in destruction effect and the ability to [[Special Summon]] itself from the [[GY]]; coupled with its high [[ATK]], it is the key card in any "Dark World" Deck. In addition to "Grapha", "[[Snoww, Unlight of Dark World]]" is able to provide quick searching and [[Deck]] thinning, which can make "[[Goldd, Wu-Lord of Dark World]]" and "[[Sillva, Warlord of Dark World]]" relatively obsolete. One strategy to utilize these effects is giving "[[Ceruli, Guru of Dark World]]" to the opponent, as when Summoned to their field, ''you'' become the player it affects. This is also particularly useful with monsters such as "[[Broww, Huntsman of Dark World]]" and "[[Beiige, Vanguard of Dark World]]", who allow for draw power and swarming the field for potential [[Link Summon|Link]] and [[Xyz Summon]]s, respectively. This can also be used to activate the effect of "[[Reign-Beaux, Overlord of Dark World]]" to utterly wipe the opponent's field clean.

  Cards like "[[Dark World Dealings]]", "[[Charge Into a Dark World]]" and "[[Dark World Brainwashing]]" are perfect inclusions, as they will provide raw power, recovery and recovering "Dark World" monsters for reuse while activating the effects of your monsters, respectively. "[[Dark Deal]]" can also help immensely, potentially putting a nice wedge in their own strategies. "[[Fabled Raven]]" is also a good choice, as not only is it a [[Tuner]] but can discard multiple "Dark World" monsters, allowing for mass Special Summoning with the right hand.

  ===Discard effects===
  This section will show exactly which effects are activated with any "Dark World" monster's discard. This also shows exactly the additional effect that happens when the opponent's effect is the cause for the discard.
  <!-- This is not a Decklist. Please only add "Dark World" monsters with effects that activate under conditions in which it was discarded.-->

  However, a "Dark World" Deck should generally not rely too heavily on card effects that require the opponent to force a discard. Although the archetype has some means of forcing the opponent to make you discard, their situational nature means that you will often have difficulty making the most of the effects. This could also lead into [[overextending]], so one should be careful with how they go about using effects that discard.

  ===Weaknesses and counter-strategies===
  * The ultimate threats to "Dark World" decks are cards that banish or lock-down GY: "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Karma Cut]]", "[[Kashtira Arise-Heart]]", "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]", "[[Banisher of the Radiance]]" , "[[Banisher of the Light]]" or "[[Macro Cosmos]]".
  ** Any Decks that stop discarding effects will also completely shut down "Dark World" decks.
  * "[[Magical Thorn]]" can inflict severe damage by forcing the opponent to take 500 damage every time they discard a card.
  * "[[The End of Anubis]]", "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]", "[[Soul Drain]]" or "[[Abyss Dweller]]" will [[Negate|negate]] or stop '''activated''' GY effects, making "Dark World" cards nearly useless.
  ** Those cards '''do not '''prevent the Summon of "Grapha".
  * "[[Consecrated Light]]" prevents DARK monsters from [[Attack|attacking]] or being Summoned.
  * [[Mirror Match]]ing another "Dark World" deck will cause any of your cards that also make your opponent discard to become a double-edged sword.
  * Like all Special Summon-based decks, cards that [[prevents Special Summons|prevent Special Summons]] will slow this deck down.
