  "'''Dark World'''" ({{Ruby|暗|あん}}{{Ruby|黒|こく}}{{Ruby|界|かい}} ''Ankokukai'') is an [[archetype]] consisting of [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They were introduced in ''[[Elemental Energy]]'', with further support in ''[[Strike of Neos]]'', ''[[Gates of the Underworld Structure Deck]]'' and ''[[Primal Origin]]''.

  [[Brron, Mad King of Dark World (character)|Brron, Mad King of Dark World]] uses this archetype in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime.
  ==Naming==
  The names of "Dark World" monsters are mostly based on colors, many of which feature prominently in their artwork and their army positions. The English names are based on the words for the colors with either extra letters added/removed or corrupt spellings. The Japanese names are based on the transcriptions of the English words for the colors with one or more [[wikipedia:Mora (linguistics)|morae]] deleted. The Chinese names are combinations of the color names and [[wikipedia:Transcription into Chinese characters|transcription]]s/transliterations of English or Japanese words, in terms of phonetics.

  ==Playing style==
  "Dark World" cards are generally intended to gain advantage by [[Summon]]ing, [[Searcher|searching]] and [[destroy]]ing cards when they are [[discard]]ed from the [[hand]] by a card effect. (They do not activate if discarded as a cost, such as with "[[Knightmare]]" monsters.) This results in a playstyle that can rapidly and aggressively [[swarm]] the [[field]] and overwhelm the opponent by disrupting their card advantage. The deck's main boss monster, "[[Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World]]", destroys cards when it is discarded and has the ability to [[Special Summon]] itself from the [[GY]]; coupled with its high [[ATK]], it is the key card in any "Dark World" Deck. In addition, "[[Snoww, Unlight of Dark World]]" and "[[Reign-Beaux, Overking of Dark World]]" can provide quick searching and [[Deck]] thinning, allowing the archetype to get whichever card is needed for the situation; the latter also has the ability to Special Summon itself from the GY.

  In order to enable their effects, "Dark World" Decks use multiple cards with effects to discard cards while gaining additional advantage. "[[Dark World Dealings]]" and their [[Field Spell Card]] "[[The Gates of Dark World]]" are some of their most versatile cards for discarding, while other cards like "[[Charge Into a Dark World]]" or "[[Dark Smog]]" provide additional field presence and disruptive banishing, respectively. The archetype also benefits from some non-archetypal [[Extra Deck]] monsters that can discard cards, such as "[[Muckraker From the Underworld]]" and "[[Number 60: Dugares the Timeless]]", as well as other archetypes that focus on discarding, such as the "[[Danger!]]" archetype.

  Many "Dark World" monsters also gain extra effects if discarded by an opponent's effect. This can be achieved by Summoning "[[Ceruli, Guru of Dark World]]" to their field, at which point its mandatory effect activates and allows the "Dark World" player to discard a card; as it is on the opponent's field, it is counted as a discard by an opponent's effect. It can also be achieved by using a card that changes an opponent's card effect to one that causes the player to discard, such as "[[Dark World Brainwashing]]", "[[Dark Deal]]", and their main [[Fusion Monster]], "[[Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World]]".

  Since the archetype's two strongest [[Main Deck]] monsters are Level 8 and can Special Summon themselves, Rank 8 monsters can also be included. "[[Coach King Giantrainer]]" can be helpful, since it can draw 3 cards and putting all of those monsters back in the GY to allow them to Summon themselves again.

  ===Discard effects===
  This section shows which effects are activated when a "Dark World" monster is discarded, and the additional effect that applies when it was discarded by an opponent's card.
  <!-- This is not a Decklist. Please only add "Dark World" monsters with effects that activate under conditions in which it was discarded.-->

  ===Additional synergies===
  * "[[Akashic Magician]]" can return a "Ceruli" on the opponent's field to the hand for reuse.
  * Some "[[Fabled]]" monsters also activate effects when they are discarded, enabling [[Synchro Summon]]s. "[[Fabled Raven]]" also discards cards as an effect to enable multiple "Dark World" activations.
  * The effect of "Ceruli" from the opponent's field will allow a player to activate "[[Triple Tactics Talent]]" and "[[Triple Tactics Thrust]]".
  * Since most "Dark World" monsters activate their effects in the GY, it is possible to use "[[Skill Drain]]" while still making the most of these effects.

  ===Weaknesses and counter-strategies===
  * The ultimate threats to "Dark World" decks are cards that [[Banishes cards that would be sent to the Graveyard|banish cards that would be sent to the GY]]: "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Karma Cut]]", "[[Kashtira Arise-Heart]]", "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]", "[[Banisher of the Radiance]]", "[[Banisher of the Light]]" or "[[Macro Cosmos]]".
  ** Any Decks that stop discarding effects will also completely shut down "Dark World" decks.
  * "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" will immediately shut down the effects of searchers such as "Snoww, Unlight of Dark World", "Reign-Beaux, Overking of Dark World" or "Genta, Gateman of Dark World" and may leave the player vulnerable.
  * "[[Magical Thorn]]" can inflict severe damage by forcing the opponent to take 500 damage every time they discard a card.
  * "[[Abyss Dweller]]", "[[The End of Anubis]]", "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]", "[[Soul Drain]]", "[[Necrovalley]]", or "[[Gravekeeper's Trap]]" will [[Negate|negate]] or prevent activated GY effects, making most "Dark World" cards nearly useless.
  ** The above cards besides "Gravekeeper's Trap" '''do not''' prevent the Summon of "Grapha" or "Reign-Beaux Overking", as their Summoning condition is not an ''activated'' effect.
  * "[[Consecrated Light]]" prevents DARK monsters from [[attack]]ing or being Summoned.
  * In a [[Mirror Match]] against another "Dark World" Deck, any cards that make both players discard will become a double-edged sword.
  * Like all Special Summon-based decks, cards that [[prevents Special Summons|prevent Special Summons]] will slow this deck down.
  * Due to the possible sequence of multiple effects or Special Summons performed in a single turn, "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" could also be dangerous to this Deck.
