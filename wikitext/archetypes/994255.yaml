  "'''Veda'''" is an [[archetype]] that debuted in ''[[Duelist Nexus]]'' before receiving direct support in ''[[Age of Overlord]]''.

  Currently, there are only 2 "Veda" monsters; "[[Veda Kalanta]]" and "[[Veda Upanishad]]". Both monsters and their related support cards also support the [[Visas]] archetype.
