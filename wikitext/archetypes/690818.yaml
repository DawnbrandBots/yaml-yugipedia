  "'''Rebellion'''" (リベリオン ''Riberion'') is an archetype of [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] [[Xyz Monsters]] used by [[Yuya Sakaki]], [[Yuto]], and [[Z-ARC]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. It is related to the "[[Odd-Eyes]]" and "[[Xyz Dragon]]" archetypes.

  The cards "[[Rebellion]]" and "[[Darklord Rebellion]]" are not members of the archetype, but since the support for this archetype only affects Xyz Monsters, this is not an issue.

  ==Playing style==
  The Rank 4 and 5 "Rebellion" members play identically to the "[[Xyz Dragon]]" archetype, having effects that can help them reach up to high ATK values to aid them in battle. 

  The "Rebellion" members that are also members of the "Odd-Eyes" archetype (ie. "[[Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon]]" and "[[Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon Overlord]]") focuses on being able to attack 3 times though it is difficult to set up the material requirements of Xyz Summoning "[[Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon]]" and getting its effect off. The introduction of the archetype's first support, "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon Overlord", gives this playstyle an alternate game plan. "Overload" can also attack 3 times like its original counterpart although it requires to be Xyz Summoned using a Rank 7 Xyz monster as material to gain this effect. It can however be Xyz Summoned on top of any "Rebellion" Xyz Monster. It is more favorable to instead use "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" (Xyz Summoned or simply cheated out of the [[Extra Deck]] with an effect such as "[[Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon]]") and then simply Xyz Summoning its "Overlord" counterpart on top of it. If "Overlord" goes to the Pendulum Zone, its Pendulum Effect can be used to Special Summon itself from there, then Xyz Summon any "Rebellion" monster using itself as material. If used to summon its original counterpart this way, this allows usage of its original counterpart with its effect being able to be activated.

  The most practical use of "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon Overload" however is to be the "middle-man" for all of the other "Rebellion" members to rank up to after they battle, before finally Xyz Summoning "[[Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder]]" on top of "Overload" with enough materials to use its Quick Effect.
