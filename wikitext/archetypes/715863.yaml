  "'''Melffy'''" (メルフィー ''Merufī'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 2 [[EARTH]] [[Beast]] [[monster]]s introduced in ''[[Rise of the Duelist]]''.
  ==Design==
  [[File:Melffy-ConceptArt.png|thumb|left|200px|Concept art for several "Melffy" monsters]]
  The artworks of this archetype are drawn in a cartoonish style similar to children's story books. It also uses pastel color palettes.
  ===Etymology===
  The name of this archetype may be a portmanteau of "märchen" (メルヘン) and "fee" (フィー). Both words are German, with "märchen" meaning "fairy tale" and "fee" meaning "fairy". It may also be a pun on "fluffy". The Spells and Traps reference various [[wikipedia: List of children's games|children games]].
  ===Appearance===
  Every member of this archetype are based on various kinds of animal. "Melffy Mommy" is probably supposed to be the 'mother' of all Melffy, as shown in the artwork of "[[Melffy Playhouse]]", where "Mommy" appears to be gigantic and taking care small Melffy monsters. All members have a heart pattern on their chest and a flower pattern on their thigh. All of the main deck monsters except "Melffy Rabby" have a combined ATK/DEF value of 400, while the extra deck monster except "Melffy Mommy" have combined value of 2500.

  ==Playing style==
  "Melffy" is an archetype focused on [[Xyz Summon]]ing and disruption tactics. Every Main Deck "Melffy" monster can Special Summon themselves from the hand on the player's End Phase, and return themselves to the hand when attacked or if the opponent summons a monster, along with some other effect meant to generically support [[Beast]] monsters, such as adding them to the hand, special summoning them or recovering them from the graveyard.
  The Xyz Monsters of the archetype have effects based on having many [[Xyz Material]]s, with the Deck's boss monster, "Melffy Mommy" being able to be Xyz Summoned with many materials at once, and gaining powerful effects once it has 5 of them, turning it into essentially a Beast "[[Yubel]]". It's very defensive in nature and stronger in grind games, attempting to gather as many resources as it can for a big attack at the end, mainly through the trap "[[Melffy Playhouse]]", which can return most of your opponent's field to the hand and increase your Xyz Monsters' ATK to ludicrous levels for a final OTK.
