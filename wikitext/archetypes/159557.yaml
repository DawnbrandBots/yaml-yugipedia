  {{Quote|[[Z-one]] on the "Timelords"|The Timelords: they're given life from an [[Infinite Machine|infinite]] term. They [[wikipedia:Sefirot|intertwine with one another]] and consist of ten god-like cards and the [[Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord|Almighty God of Gods]].}}
  "'''Timelord'''", known as "'''Time Machine God'''" ({{Ruby|時|じ}}{{Ruby|械|かい}}{{Ruby|神|しん}} ''Jikaishin'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an archetype consists of [[Level]] 10 [[Fairy]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Z-one]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime. [[Eve]] also uses a member of this archetype in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' manga, the [[Synchro Monster]] "[[Timelord Progenitor Vorpgate]]".
  In the anime, Timelords have a [[Rare]] rarity, with the exception of "[[Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord (anime)|Sephylon]]", which has an [[Ultra Rare]] rarity instead.
  ==Design==
  <div style="float:right;">[[File:Timelord Tree Of Life.png|thumb|190px|The Tree of Life and the Timelords]]</div>
  [[File:Timelord Lineart.jpg|thumb|left|Lineart]]
  The first 10 "Timelords" are based on the 10 attributes or emanations of the [[wikipedia:Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]], the mystic symbol used in the [[wikipedia:Kabbalah|Kabbalah]], known as the [[wikipedia:Sefirot|Sefirot]]. The 11th member, "[[Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord]]", is named after the Sefirot itself (Sephirot). The "Timelords" are depicted as metal suits of armor with an angel face on their chest.
  The first 10 "Timelords" each reflect a Sefirah, as well as an [[wikipedia:archangel|archangel]]. "[[Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord|Sephylon]]" reflects the mystical state where all 10 Sefirots become one, [[wikipedia:Da'at|Da'at]], and God.
  {{clear|left}}
  ===Members===
  The first 10 "Timelords" share the following [[Monster effect|effects]]:
  * ''Cannot be [[Special Summon]]ed from the [[Main Deck|Deck]].''
  * ''If you control no [[Monster Card|monsters]], you can [[Normal Summon]] this card without [[Tribute|Tributing]].''
  ** For "[[Sandaion, the Timelord]]" only, this is instead ''If only your opponent controls a monster, you can Normal Summon this card without Tributing.''
  * ''Cannot be [[destroyed by battle]] or [[card effect]]s.''
  * ''You take no [[battle damage]] from [[attack]]s involving this card.''
  ** For "[[Metaion, the Timelord]]", and all "Timelord" monsters in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 6]]'', this effect only applies if the monster is in [[Attack Position]].
  ** "[[Sandaion, the Timelord]]" instead prevents either player from taking battle damage from attacks involving it.
  * ''At the end of the [[Battle Phase]], if this card [[battle]]d: [Unique effect].''
  ** In ''Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 6'' only, for "[[Raphion, the Timelord]]" this effect [[activate]]s at the end of the [[Damage Step]].
  * ''[[Once per turn]], during your [[Standby Phase]]: [[Shuffle]] this card into the Deck.''
  * Additionally, "[[Lazion, the Timelord]]" and "[[Zaphion, the Timelord]]" have additional unique effects that are not dependent on the Battle Phase.

  "[[Timelord Progenitor Vorpgate]]" is separate from the first 10 Timelords and "Sephylon", as it originates from the ''ARC-V'' manga instead. It is named after the [[wikipedia:Vulgate|Vulgate]], a late-4th-century Latin translation of the Bible, instead of an archangel.

  ==Playing style==
  "Timelord" [[Monster Card|monsters]] have a [[Stall]] and [[Burn Deck|Burn]] playstyle. They protect the player from [[battle damage]], while their other [[Card effect|effects]] slowly [[Effect damage|damage]] the opponent. As they do not need to rely on [[Special Summon]]s, many [[anti-meta]] cards can be used with them.
  An [[OTK]] is possible by Normal Summoning "[[Sandaion, the Timelord]]" and Special Summoning "[[Michion, the Timelord]]" with "[[Celestial Transformation]]" (or vice-versa), attacking with "Michion" to halve the opponent's LP (8000 LP → 4000 LP) and "Sandaion" to inflict 2000 damage (4000 LP → 2000 LP), then Xyz Summon "[[Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max]]" and using its effect (2000 LP → 0 LP).

  ===Weaknesses===
  While the "Timelords" cannot be destroyed, they are not unbeatable and can can still be [[banish]]ed or [[Tribute]]d. Their Summon can also be negated by a card like "[[Solemn Warning]]". To overcome these weaknesses, cards that protect against direct attacks can be useful.
  In addition, cards that can negate the effects of "Timelord" are extremely useful, as that will strip them of all their protection and leave the opponent with a 0 ATK monster that cannot do anything. (However, this will be less useful against "Sandaion" and "Sephylon".)
  Cards that can attack the opponent directly, such as "[[Earthbound Immortal]]" or "[[Toon]]" monsters can be very useful against "Timelord" monsters, as they can bypass their protection and effects and deal your opponent significant damage in the process.
  "Timelord" monsters rely on attacking for their effects to activate, so any number of basic [[stall]] cards that aim to block the opponent's attacks will stop them as well, including [[battle position]] changers. However, this weakness can be overcome by using cards that force the "Timelord" monster to be attacked.
  "Timelord" monsters are also especially weak against [[Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon]] because it banishes any monster that is not destroyed by it when it attacks. Since the "Timelord" is banished, its effect cannot trigger and it bypasses the "Timelord" non-destroyable effect via banishment.
  ==Trivia==
  * During his [[Turbo Duel]] with [[Yusei Fudo]], Z-one Summons the "Timelords" in the order of their corresponding Sefirot. In addition, he also attacks in this order when he controls multiple "Timelords".
