  "'''Floowandereeze'''" (ふわんだりぃず ''Fuwandarīzu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[WIND]]/[[WATER]] [[Winged Beast]] monsters introduced in ''[[Burst of Destiny]]''.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines#No. 06: Floowandereeze}}

  ==Etymology==
  "Floowandereeze" is a combination of "wander" and "breeze", with an additional "Floo" added to the front to approximate the archetype's Japanese name (while also being reminiscent of the English word "flew"). The original Japanese name's first part instead comes from the Japanese word ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ふわふわ fuwafuwa]'' ("fluffy").

  ==Design==
  <div style="float:right">[[File:Floowandereeze-ConceptArt.png|thumb|250px|"Floowandereeze" concept art]]</div>
  These cards all show in their artwork the titular three "Floowandereeze" birds, which are based on the [[wikipedia:Arctic tern|Arctic tern]], traveling to various locations (as seen in the artwork of "[[Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map|Magnificent Map]]" and other [[Spell]]s/[[Trap]]s) to meet a different type of bird. The travel of the "Floowandereeze" birds and the locations they visit (Europe, the Americas, and Africa) is based on the Arctic tern's long North-South migration route from the Arctic to the Antarctic.

  The [[Level]] 10 "Floowandereeze" monsters are both based on birds from polar regions, while the other "Floowandereeze" monsters are based on birds in non-polar regions.

  ==Playing style==
  The archetype is centered around [[Normal Summon]]ing many times per turn and gaining advantage out of those Normal Summons.

  Each of the [[Level]] 1 "Floowandereeze" monster has a two-part [[Trigger Effect]] that can be activated upon being Normal Summoned. At resolution, the Trigger Effect first provides the player with an advantageous effect, and then allows the player to immediately Normal Summon another [[Winged Beast]] monster. This allows the player to sequentially Normal Summon several Level 1 "Floowandereeze" monsters in a row to continuously gain advantage and expand their board.

  |}

  The key starter card for the deck is "Robina", who provides a 1 card combo: "Robina" can search out and Normal Summon "Eglen", who can then search out a Level 7 or higher Winged Beast monster, such as one of the "Floowandereeze" boss monsters, and [[Tribute Summon]] it.

  The archetype has a secondary focus on [[banish]]ing its cards and then recurring them. The Level 1 "Floowandereeze" monsters are banished if they leave the [[field]], but while banished, they can return themselves to the [[hand]] if a Winged Beast monster is Normal Summoned, replenishing the player's hand for another sequence of Normal Summons and effect activations. These effects give the [[Deck]] an extremely reliable grind game, and the player will almost never run out of Level 1 monsters for Normal Summoning.

  The archetype's primary game plan is to establish a floodgate by Tribute Summoning its Level 10 boss monsters, "[[Floowandereeze & Empen]]" and "[[Floowandereeze & Snowl]]", who specialize in countering [[Special Summon]]ing. "Empen" can prevent the opponent from [[activating]] the effects of [[Attack Position]] Special Summoned monsters, while "Snowl" can [[flip]] all of the opponent's Special Summoned monsters [[face-down]] as a [[Quick Effect]].

  The archetype's [[Spell]]/[[Trap]] [[support]] reaffirms its Normal Summon-centered strategy and rounds out the strategy with protection and consistency.

  * "[[Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map]]" and "[[Floowandereeze and the Advent of Adventure]]" both provide [[search]] power and resistance against negates (via chain blocking and banishing the player's cards as cost to dodge targeted effects).
  * "[[Floowandereeze and the Unexplored Winds]]" provides [[Draw a card|draw]] power and card removal during Tribute Summoning.
  * "[[Floowandereeze and the Dreaming Town]]" enables the player to Normal Summon during the opponent's turn, allowing the player to rapidly expand their board, search for follow-up, and disrupt the opponent.
  * "[[Floowandereeze and the Scary Sea]]", the theme's [[Counter Trap]], is an additional piece of floodgate that [[negate]]s an opponent's Special Summon, locks them from Special Summoning for the rest of that turn, but in exchange allows them to Normal Summon 3 times during that turn.

  The player cannot Special Summon during turn they use either effect of the Level 1 monsters, so a "Floowandereeze" Deck has no reliance on the [[Extra Deck]] at all, which allows the player to use generic cards like "[[Pot of Duality]]", "[[Pot of Prosperity]]", "[[Dogmatika Punishment]]", "[[The Monarchs Stormforth]]", "[[Tribute Burial]]" etc whose downsides generally are not an issue to the player whatsoever. Additionally, the archetype's focus on banish and recursion allows mass banishing floodgates like "[[Dimension Shifter]]" to be freely used in the Deck.

  Externally, "Robina" and "Eglen" can search a variety of other Winged Beast monsters whose effects complement the Deck: "Robina" can search "[[Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds]]" and immediately Normal Summon it, or search "[[D.D. Crow]]" for an extra disruption. "Eglen" meanwhile can search "[[Mist Valley Apex Avian]]", "[[Raiza the Mega Monarch]]", "[[Simorgh, Lord of the Storm]]", "[[Dark Simorgh]]", and "[[Simorgh of Darkness]]", providing a diverse array of boss monster options.

  ===Not recommended===
  * "[[The Monarchs Erupt]]" might seem attractive in the first place, but it locks out all of your level 1 "Floowandereeze" monsters.
  ===Weaknesses===
  * As the archtype is heavily reliant on banishing their own cards, cards that prevent banishing effect, such as "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" or "[[Chaos Hunter]]" can shut down most of the play.
  * As the archtype is dependent on requiring Winged Beast monsters on the field to activate their effects, cards that change the [[Type]] of monsters, like "[[Zombie World]]" can slow down the deck.
