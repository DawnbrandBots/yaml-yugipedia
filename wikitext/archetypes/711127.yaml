  "'''Labrynth'''" (ラビュリンス ''Rabyurinsu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Tactical Masters]]''/''[[Tactical Masters]]''. It also has a sub-archetype of [[Normal Trap Card]]s: "[[Welcome Labrynth (archetype)|Welcome Labrynth]]".

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 04: Labrynth}}

  ==Etymology==
  The archetype's name, "Labrynth", seems to be a portmanteau of "love" or "love you" and "labyrinth"; additionally, the name's reading sounds similar to "labrys", a term for double-bladed axes (which can be seen wielded by "[[Lovely Labrynth of the Silver Castle]]"), which is an important religious symbol of the ancient Cretan religion usually depicted alongside the religion's goddesses.

  ==Design==
  [[File:Crest-Labrynth.png|thumb|right|150px|The "Labrynth" crest.]]
  The "Labrynth" cards are themed after trap-filled mansions often seen in "trap 'em up" video games such as the ''[[wikipedia:Deception (video game series)|Deception]]'' series and its spinoff ''[[wikipedia:Trapt (video game)|Trapt]]'', as well as the ''Dungeon Maker'' series; in these games, the player sets up traps to eliminate and/or capture invading enemies. Additionally, the theme is also based on the ancient [[wikipedia:Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of [[wikipedia:Theseus|Theseus]] and the Minoan [[wikipedia:Labyrinth#Cretan labyrinth|Labyrinth]] of the [[wikipedia:Minotaur|Minotaur]].

  The theme's monsters are based on denizens of a certain [[Trap]]-filled castle ("[[Labrynth Labyrinth]]"), as well as the animated inanimate objects stationed within that may spring to life and attack the invaders.

  ==Playing style==
  "Labrynth" is a Trap-focused archetype focusing on using [[Normal Trap Card]]s to [[Leaves the field|remove]] monsters from the [[field]], in order to activate [[Trigger Effect]]s from archetypal cards.

  {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
  |-

  | rowspan="5" | [[Effect Monster]]

  |-
  | [[Arianna the Labrynth Servant|Servant Arianna]]
  | rowspan="2" | [[Draw]] 1 card, then [[Special Summon]] 1 [[Fiend]] monster, or [[Set]] 1 [[Spell]]/[[Trap]], from the hand.
  |-
  | [[Ariane the Labrynth Servant|Servant Ariane]]
  |-
  | [[Labrynth Chandraglier|Chandraglier]]
  | [[Add]] this card from the [[GY]] to the hand.
  |-
  | [[Labrynth Stovie Torbie|Stovie Torbie]]
  | Special Summon this card from the GY.
  |-
  | [[Welcome Labrynth|Welcome]]
  | [[Normal Trap]]
  | Set this card from your GY.
  |}

  If the player's field and GY is set up with these "Labrynth" cards, removing a single monster with a Normal Trap can trigger all of these Trigger Effects at once, generating a massive amount of advantage.

  The key starter and engine card for the archetype is the archetypal Normal Trap "[[Welcome Labrynth]]", which Special Summons a "Labrynth" monster from the player's [[Deck]], and can recover itself with its trigger effect for more Summons. Aside from generic searchers, it is also searchable in-archetype by "Labrynth Chandraglier", "Labrynth Stovie Torbie", and "Arianna the Labrynth Servant".

  Aside from their Trigger Effects, "Labrynth" cards also feature [[effect]]s that support non-"Labrynth" Normal Traps. This, combined with the fact that the archetype's own Normal Traps, "[[Farewelcome Labrynth]]", "[[Labrynth Barrage]]", and "Welcome Labrynth", are ineffective at removing monsters due to their restrictive conditions and effects (in the case of "Welcome Labrynth", it requires the archetype's [[Field Spell]], "[[Labrynth Labyrinth]]", to be able to remove monsters), strongly encourages the player to use non-archetypal traps.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Because of their heavy reliance on Trap Cards, cards that counter them or prevent them from activating or playing such as "[[Jinzo]]", "[[Royal Decree]]" and "[[Eradicator Epidemic Virus]]" will immediately cripple or shut down the deck.
  * As Labrynth monsters are all DARK, "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" is also very effective against Labrynth monsters and can counter them from searching Trap Cards.
  * "[[Consecrated Light]]" prevents DARK monsters from [[Attack|attacking]] or being Summoned.
