  "'''Vylon'''" (ヴァイロン ''Vairon'') is an [[archetype]] that debuted in ''[[Duel Terminal - Vylon Descends!!]]'' and focuses around the use of [[Equip Card]]s.
  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  The monsters appear as angelic, vaguely humanoid machines, have [[LIGHT]] as their [[Attribute]], and have either [[Fairy]], [[Machine]], or ([[Vylon Prism|in one case]]) [[Thunder]] as their [[Type]]. Their team symbol is a golden-orange orb, often with gold metal trim.
  ===Members===
  The names of various cards from the archetype are based on mathematical concepts and constants.
  ====Tuner monsters====
  "Vylon" [[Tuner monster]]s are based on three-dimensional polytopes.

  ==Story==
  {{Cleanup|section}}
  In the story of the Duel Terminals, the Vylon are holy machine weapons created by the "[[Constellar]]" in The Ancient Era to oversee the seal they had placed upon the "[[Steelswarm]]", and were designed to be impervious to the corruption of the "[[lswarm]]". As ages passed and the Constellar returned to the stars, the Vylon merely observed the confrontations that took place on the Surface World below. Even through the wars against the "[[Worm]]s" and the "[[Fabled]]s" and the resulting devastation caused by the "[[Ice Barrier]]" Dragons, they stayed silent.
  Within the second generation of the Duel Terminals, the Vylon choose to appear during a conflict that breaks out between the "Laval" and "[[Gem-Knight]]" tribes, descending from the heavens amidst the fighting and forcing a temporary ceasefire between the warring clans. "[[Gishki Noellia]]", a former member of the "Ice Barrier" possessed by the madness of the "lswarm", revives the Steelswarm by launching an assault on the "[[Gusto]]" tribe in their homeland of the Mist Valley Marshlands, trying to gain control of [[Shrine of Mist Valley|a certain shrine]]. Feeding off the chaos of the fighting, the Steelswarm break free of their containment and ravage the Surface World, seeking revenge on those that had sealed them away long ago. The Vylon relay this turn of events to the Constellar before turning their attention to the battles ahead. The fated collision, that which they had been created for so long ago, awaited them.
  To combat this powerful threat and common enemy, the four tribes of "Gem-Knight", "Laval", "Gusto" and "[[Gishki]]" create an alliance under the umbrella of the Vylon forces. In their time of need, the Vylon send each of the tribes new power via "[[Vylon Element]]".

  War rages against the onslaught of the Steelswarm and many are lost, including "[[Vylon Alpha]]". The final battle reaches its appex when "[[Steelswarm Hercules]]" rises to end it himself. Suddenly "[[Vylon Omega]]" arrives from the Vylon Element gateway to turn the tides! Omega descends upon the field of battle to cast judgment, vaporizing all the lesser Steelswarm that draw near. The war is decided when the two leaders clash, and in the end both lie defeated.
  Peace after their victory doesn't last as the other tribes soon return to fighting over their petty conflicts. The Vylon cannot understand such disunion, and the defeat of the Steelswarm is shown to have had an effect on them: during the final battle, when "[[Vylon Tetra]]" was used in a ritual by Noellia to merge into Tetrogre, the evil of the "lswarm" possessing Noellia touched the hive-mind of the Vylon. The resulting madness quickly spread through the Vylon ranks, warping them in a way that the "lswarm" never could physically. The Vylon resolve to exterminate the other tribes to end their on-going feuds for good and create the perfect utopia. "[[Vylon Stigma]]", "[[Vylon Tesseract]]" and "[[Vylon Pentachloro]]" [[Xyz Summon|join]] to create the seeker of absolute unity, "[[Vylon Disigma]]".
  The four tribes are forced to unite once again, [[Xyz Summon|sharing their powers]] to combat this friend-turned-foe. Disigma absorbs members of the other tribes, gaining the power to defeat each one in turn and heavily damaging them. Disigma decides the fate of "[[Evigishki Merrowgeist]]", "[[Evigishki Gustkraken]]", "[[Lavalval Ignis]]", "[[Lavalval Dragun]]", "[[Daigusto Phoenix]]", and "[[Daigusto Falcos]]" in his rampage (minus "[[Kamui, Hope of Gusto]]", who Falcos aided in escaping). Only "[[Gem-Knight Pearl]]", created from the strength of the Gem-Knights and the Gishki, proves [[Non-Effect Monster|immune to Disigma's absorption ability]] and has the power to end the [[Xyz Reversal|twisted angel]]. With the Vylon [[Oni-Gami Combo|crushed]], yet another threat is overcome. [[lswarm|The true enemy]] is only just stirring, however, and now the Vylon are not there to oppose it...
  ==Playing style==
  Vylon is an [[Equip Card]]-focused archetype, revolving around using Equip Cards to power up its Extra Deck monsters. Vylon Main Deck [[Tuner]] and [[Union monster]]s can typically equip themselves to other monsters, and Vylon Extra Deck monsters typicaly have effects that require sending Equip Cards to the Graveyard as [[cost]], as well as effects to equip additional Equip Cards to themselves.
  Most Vylon Decks throughout the Deck's history revolved around a [[swarm]]ing loop created by "[[Vylon Element]]" and "[[Rod of Silence - Kay'est]]". However, there did exist some historical variants that forgoed the loop, such as Vylon Sigma OTK, which focused on performing an [[OTK]] with "[[Vylon Sigma]]" (by equipping it with "[[Twin Swords of Flashing Light - Tryce]]" and "[[Mage Power]]"), and Epsilon Control, which focused on summoning "[[Vylon Epsilon]]" and controlling the field by destroying opposing cards.
  Vylon Main Deck monsters are low-Level monsters with minor Equip-related battle or utility effect. The only Vylon non-Tuner monsters of note are:
  * "[[Vylon Hept|Hept]]", who can Special Summon a Vylon monster that is an Equip Card.
  * "[[Vylon Tesseract|Tesseract]]" and "[[Vylon Pentachloro|Pentachloro]]", who are [[LIGHT]] [[Machine]] [[Union monster]]s; they're thus supported by Machine Union support, most notably "[[Union Hangar]]".
  Vylon Tuner monsters are the Deck's main combo enablers.
  * "[[Vylon Cube|Cube]]" can search any [[Equip Spell]] if sent to the Graveyard for the Synchro Summon of a LIGHT monster, enabling specific Equip-based combos.
  * "[[Vylon Sphere|Sphere]]", "[[Vylon Tetra|Tetra]]", "[[Vylon Stella|Stella]]", "[[Vylon Prism|Prism]]" can equip themselves to a face-up monster if they're sent from the Monster Zone to the Graveyard, providing more Equips to Vylon Extra Deck monsters.
  ** "[[Vylon Sphere|Sphere]]" can replace itself with an Equip Spell in the player's Graveyard, enabling certain specific combos.
  All Vylon [[Equip Spell]]s ("[[Vylon Segment|Segment]]", "[[Vylon Component|Component]]", "[[Vylon Material|Material]]", "[[Vylon Filament|Filament]]") can only be equipped to Vylon monsters, and provide minor battle boosts or protection. Their main use comes in their shared secondary effect: if they are sent from the face-up field to the GY, they can each search another Vylon Spell. This provides immediate access to the Deck's key combo-making Spells, and its non-once-per-turn nature enables the Vylon swarming loop.
  The [[Continuous Spell]] "[[Vylon Element]]" is the key to the Vylon swarming loop. Non-once-per-turn, when a "Vylon" Equip Card is destroyed, "Element" can Special Summon a "Vylon" Tuner monster from the player's Deck. By equipping a Vylon monster with "[[Rod of Silence - Kay'est]]", then equipping it with "Vylon" Equip Spells, "Rod of Silence" will immediately destroy the Equip Spells, triggering "Element" to summon a Vylon, and triggering the Equip Spells to search out another Equip Spell, which can be repeated for more summons. With enough Vylon monsters, the Deck can easily summon multiple "[[Vylon Omega]]" with multiple equip spells for multiple negates, or set up a [[Link Monster]]-based board.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Performing the "Vylon Element" loop requires a large amount of "Vylon" Tuner monsters and "Vylon" Equip Spells, most of which have largely irrelevant effects, giving the Deck issues with [[brick]]ing.
  * The "Vylon Element" loop requires searching several specific cards to function, and its setup can be easily disrupted.
  * The deck generally lacks Special Summoning tools outside of "Element", meaning that the Deck is quite fragile and struggles to play through disruption.
  * The deck provides little in-archetype protection against backrow removal, and removing Equip Cards can often completely shut down the effects of "Vylon" Extra Deck monsters.
  * The "Vylon Element" loop is directly countered by:
  ** Anti-Graveyard floodgates (e.g. "[[Macro Cosmos]]")
  ** Anti-Spell floodgates (e.g. "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]")
  ** Anti-Summoning floodgates (e.g. "[[Summon Limit]]")
  * The Deck as a whole is directly countered by:
  ** Anti-Synchro floodgates (e.g. "[[Dimensional Barrier]]")
  ** Anti-LIGHT floodgates (e.g. "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]", "[[Koa'ki Meiru Drago]]")
  ==Trivia==
  * All non-[[Synchro Monster|Synchro]], [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] and [[Tuner monster|Tuner]] Vylons are [[Level 4 Monster Cards]].
  * All of the "Vylon" monsters have a similar armor style to the "[[Constellar]]" monsters.
  * "[[Steelswarm Roach]]" is a "[[Steelswarm Sentinel]]" that gained power from a corrupted Vylon fragment, as shown in "[[Advance Zone]]".
  * The Vylon monsters in ''[[Duel Terminal - Xyz Startup!!]]'' all lack the team symbol.
  * Vylons are the only Duel Terminal archetype that don't have a corrupted version of one of their monsters as an [[lswarm]] monster, aside from the Steelswarm from which the corruption originated. While they were amongst the first to be tainted by this epidemic, they could not be physically corrupted into an Evilswarm monster, thus why they were tasked with dealing with the [[Steelswarm]] in the first place.
  * This Archetype's Synchro Monsters (white card frames) are mainly white, while its [[Xyz Monster]] (black card frame) is mainly black.
  ** This seems symbolic of their moral alignment in the [[Duel Terminal]] story: while at first they are the world's saviors in the name of order, their need for order turns them against the other tribes after their battle with the [[Steelswarm]].
  *The majority of the Vylon Synchro/Xyz Monsters are Fairy (except "[[Vylon Alpha]]"), while their Tuner monsters are Machine, except "[[Vylon Prism]]" (Thunder) and "[[Vylon Stella]]" (Fairy).
  *All Tuners, except "[[Vylon Stella]]", have ATK equal to their DEF like the original "Ancient Gears".
