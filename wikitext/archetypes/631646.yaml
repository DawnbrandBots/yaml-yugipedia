  ==Playing style==
  The "Appliancer" archetype has a unique play-style revolving around their cards being [[linked]] or not, referencing the way appliances work. By nature of being a [[Link Monster]]-heavy archetype, they can also accomplish [[swarm]]ing to do this. Within the [[Main Deck]], "Socketroll" [[Special Summon]]s itself from the [[hand]] if you control another member of the archetype, which can allow "Copybokkle" to [[target]] it and in turn, Special Summon itself from the hand as well; this also lets "Copybokkle" copy that monster’s name until the [[End Phase]]. Special Summoning any "Appliancer" while controlling "Socketroll" allows said monster to [[Summon]] additional copies of itself from the Deck as well. "Copybokkle" can aid in this as by [[banish]]ing it from the [[GY]], bar the turn it was sent there, allows it to Summon additional members from the hand and GY as long as they share a name. This can potentially be repeated during each of your turns to quickly [[Link Summon]] practically almost any monster for the situation. To protect these monsters, the effects of "Breakerbuncle"can be used, as [[discard]]ing it during battle can save them from destruction and prevent [[battle damage]]. It can also banish itself from the GY to provide protection from card effects that would destroy your cards.
  When activated, "[[Appliancer Electrilyrical World]]" can [[add]] any cards from the archetype to your hand, except any [[Field Spell]]s. It can also recycle your "Appliancer" monsters in the GY once each turn you Link Summon one of the [[Extra Deck]] members and, taking advantage of the way they function is able to move them to different [[Main Monster Zone]]s when an attack is declared. "[[Appliancer Reuse]]" revives any of the monsters, but places them on the bottom of the Deck if they [[leave the field]]. "[[Appliancer Test]]", on the other hand, is able to bring back multiple [[Link Rating|Link]]-1 members from the GY to any zones the targeted "Appliancer" Link Monster points to, though they will be banished if still present during the [[End Phase]]. 
  As for said monsters, the most important one is "[[Appliancer Celtopus]]", as it’s the only Link-2 member as well as the only one with [[Link Arrow]]s that point down; all others point up, as such keeping it in the [[Extra Monster Zone]] is paramount to the archetype’s play-style. Luckily, while linked it cannot be targeted for card effects or attacks, while also providing any linked "Appliancer" an additional 1000 [[ATK]] per monster linked to "Celtopus" during damage calculation. If an "Appliancer" Link Monster that is not linked is destroyed, it allows you to draw 1 card. For the Link-1 monsters, "[[Appliancer Dryer Drake]]" cannot be used as [[Link Material]] the turn it’s Link Summoned - an effect shared by all the Link-1 monsters - but gains 1000 ATK if linked and can switch places with any other "Appliancer" during your [[Battle Phase]], which allows the other monster to attack twice, but when a monster that isn’t [[co-linked]] is attacked it can negate said attack. "[[Appliancer Kappa Scale]]" can [[Tribute]] itself to either Special Summon one of its Link brethren or a [[Level]] 4 or lower Main Deck "Appliancer" from the GY depending on whether it was or was not co-linked, respectively. "[[Appliancer Laundry Dragon]]", while incapable of inflicting battle damage, can banish any monster it battles while co-linked, and while not, it instead destroys that monster while inflicting its [[Original ATK and DEF|original ATK]] as [[effect damage]]. "[[Appliancer Vacculephant]]" can send a card from your hand to the GY to target and destroy a card the opponent controls, but while do-linked can destroy any of their monsters without losing [[hand advantage]] or is able to attack directly while not co-linked.

  ==Weaknesses==
  * Being made up of Machines, "[[Cyber Dragon]]" can consume all the monsters on the field for "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" as well as making "[[System Down]]" hugely disruptive without "Conversion" to recover Banished resources.
  * "[[Artifact Scythe]]" prevents "Appliancers" from accessing over half their theme's names for a turn. "[[Vanity's Fiend]]" and "[[Archlord Kristya]]" can also devastate any chance of progression to the deck's win conditions.
