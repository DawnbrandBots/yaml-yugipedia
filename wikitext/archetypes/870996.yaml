  "'''Tearlaments'''" (ティアラメンツ ''Tiaramentsu'') is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[DARK]] [[Aqua]] monsters introduced in ''[[Power of the Elements]]''.

  ==Etymology==
  "Tearlaments" is a portmanteau of "tear", "tiara", and "lament". The theme of sadness may be a reference to the tragic fairy tale ''[[wikipedia:The Little Mermaid|The Little Mermaid]]''.

  The archetype's name may also be a play on "firmaments", referring to the tiered layers of "[[Primeval Planet Perlereino]]".

  The majority of "Tearlaments" [[Main Deck]] monsters are named after types of mermaids and other similar mythological creatures. "[[Tearlaments Kitkallos]]" is named after ''[[wikipedia:Chaetoceros|Chaetoceros]]'', a genus of marine planktonic diatoms. This may also be a reference to ''The Little Mermaid'', as marine planktons are one of the main components of sea foam (according to the fairy tale, mermaids turn into sea foam upon death).

  "[[Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart]]" is named after a kaleidoscope, referencing the archetype's stained glass aesthetic.

  ==Design==
  ===Members===
  With the exceptions of "[[Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart]]", "[[Tearlaments Reinoheart]]", and "[[Tearlaments Kashtira]]", the members of the archetype are [[DARK]] [[Aqua]] monsters.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Tearlaments" archetype is centered on [[mill]]ing cards from the player's [[Deck]], in order to perform [[Fusion Summon]]s with the [[Trigger Effect]] activated when a Main Deck "Tearlaments" monster is sent to the GY. The Deck has a notable secondary focus on Fusion Summoning during the opponent's turn to trigger additional beneficial Trigger Effects. As an archetype in the lore of "[[Visas Starfrost]]", certain "Tearlaments" cards also interact with "Visas Starfrost".

  Every Main Deck "Tearlaments" card has a beneficial Trigger Effect triggered when they are sent to the GY by a [[card effect]] (such as by being milled). The central effect among them is the Fusion effect of the 3 "Tearlaments" mermaid monsters; by triggering this effect on both player's turns, and using GY materials, the Deck can rapidly create Fusion boards with minimal on-field material costs.

  "Tearlaments" Main Deck monsters are the Deck's main starters, as each of them provides a milling-related on-field effect. "[[Tearlaments Havnis|Havnis]]" is a [[hand trap]] that mills 3, "[[Tearlaments Merrli|Merrli]]" mills 3 on summon, and "[[Tearlaments Scheiren|Scheiren]]" is a special summon extender (with an extra discard cost) that also mills 3. Lastly, "[[Tearlaments Reinoheart|Reinoheart]]" precisely sends 1 "Tearlaments" monster from Deck to GY on summon, making it a 1-card starter.

  "Tearlaments" Spell/Traps provide searchable interaction and extension. Many of them first provide a beneficial effect, and then forces the player to send a monster from their hand/field/Deck to the GY. By activating them on the opponent's turn, the Deck can trigger its monsters' GY effects, and in turn Fusion Summon, in the opponent's turn.

  The Deck has an additional non-archetypal Field Spell, "[[Primeval Planet Perlereino]]", who lacks a GY effect. It searches a "Tearlaments" monster on activation, providing immediate access to the 1-card starter "[[Tearlaments Reinoheart|Reinoheart]]". It also targets and destroys 1 card if a "Tearlaments" monster is returned from the field/GY to the Deck/Extra Deck, providing additional advantage from "Tearlaments" Fusion Summons, even in the opponent's turn. It can also be used to destroy friendly cards to trigger their GY effects for more varied combos.

  "Tearlaments" Fusion Monsters provide the Deck's main field prescence and consistent combo-making tools.

  * "[[Tearlaments Kitkallos|Kitkallos]]" is the Deck's main Extra Deck searcher and combo enabler, with 3 extremely powerful consistency-boosting effects.
  ** If it is summoned, it can take 1 "Tearlaments" card from the Deck, and add it to hand or send it to the GY, providing access to almost every effect within the archetype.
  ** Its second effect targets 1 friendly monster, Special Summons 1 "Tearlaments" monster from hand or GY, and sends that friendly monster to the GY; this provides access to the on-summon effects of "Reinoheart" and "Meirrow", and triggers even more "Tearlaments" monsters' GY effects.
  ** Its third effect is its GY trigger effect triggered if it is sent to the GY by a card effect, which mills 5 cards, providing a significant boost of GY milling resources for more Fusion Summons.
  * "[[Tearlaments Kaleido-Heart|Kaleido-Heart]]" is the Deck's main offensive 3-material boss monster. If it is summoned, or if an Aqua monster is sent to the player's GY by a card effect, it can target and shuffle 1 opposing card into the Deck. This provides immediate on-summon removal (synergizing with Fusion Summons made in the opponent's turn), and also synergizes with milling effects done in the opponent's turn. Its second GY trigger effect has it Special Summon itself and send 1 "Tearlaments" card from Deck to GY, giving it self-recovery and engaging additional "Tearlaments" GY effects.
  * "[[Tearlaments Rulkallos|Rulkallos]]" is the Deck's main defensive 2-material boss monster. It provides battle protection to Aqua monsters and a Special Summon negate, the latter also requiring  sending 1 "Tearlaments" card from the player's hand or face-up field to the GY (engaging more "Tearlaments" GY effects). It also has a (functionally one-time-only) GY self-revival effect if it is sent to the GY by a card effect after being Fusion Summoned.

  The Deck is incredibly resilient against effect destructions, as destroying any of its cards with effects will trigger their GY Trigger Effects, leading to more Fusion Summons or resource recovery. The Deck even has the potential for turn-0 plays, thanks to the hand-activated effect of "Havfenis".

  Externally, the Deck can synergize with a wide variety of Fusion or milling-based engines and packages.
