  "'''Dododo'''" (ドドド ''Dododo'') is an [[archetype]] of (mostly) [[wikipedia:Vikings|viking]]-themed [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yuma Tsukumo]] from the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (manga)|manga]]. All members of this archetype are [[Warrior]] monsters, except for the [[Machine]] "[[Dododo Bot]]" and [[Rock]] "[[Dodododwarf Gogogoglove]]", and [[EARTH]], except for the [[LIGHT]] "[[Utopic Onomatopoeia]]".

  ==Playing style==
  The [[effect]]s of the [[Monster Card|monsters]], particularly "[[Dododo Buster]]", are designed to allow for easy [[Rank]] 4 and 6 [[Xyz Summon]]s. In addition, they all have respectable [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] on their own, and two of the five members of the archetype excel at dealing with opposing card effects when they [[attack]]; "[[Dododo Bot]]" cannot be affected by other cards (allowing it to punch through such defenses as "[[Dimensional Prison]]" unhindered), while "[[Dododo Warrior]]" [[negate]]s effects that would activate in the [[Graveyard]] such as "[[Necro Gardna]]".

  "[[Dododo Witch]]" allows you to Special Summon other "Dododo" monsters in either [[face-up]] [[Attack Position]] or [[face-down]] [[Defense Position]]. The former can be used to bypass the Summoning restrictions of "Dododo Bot", while the latter can be used to effectively Summon the Level 8 "[[Dododo Swordsman]]" and use its effects, letting it destroy two face-up monsters, and potentially turning it into a 3500 ATK beatstick.
