  "'''Z-ONE'''" ({{Ruby|Ｚ－ＯＮＥ|ゾーン}}, ''Zōn'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Boss Duel]] cards, based on cards used by [[Z-one]] in the anime. The [[Monster Card|monsters]] are all based on "[[Timelord]]" monsters, and can Summon Tokens that are part of the "Timelord" archetype that are also based on "Timelord" monsters.

  "[[Z-ONE]]" is not a "Z-ONE" card because it does not have 「{{Ruby|Ｚ－ＯＮＥ|ゾーン}}」 in its Japanese name.
