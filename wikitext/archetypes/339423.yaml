  '''"Performage"''', known as '''"Entermage"''' ({{Ruby|Ｅｍ|エンタメイジ}} ''Entameiji'')  in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Dennis McField]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. They debuted in the set ''[[Clash of Rebellions]]''.

  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  "Performage" [[Monster Card|monsters]] are based on [[wikipedia:Circus|Circus]] artists, such as jugglers, flame eaters and trapeze artists.

  ===Etymology===
  "Performage", the English name of this archetype, is a portmanteau of "Perform" and "Mage". "Entermage", the Japanese name of this archetype, is a portmanteau of "Entertainment" and "Mage". Their name draws parallels with [[Yuya Sakaki|Yuya]]'s "[[Performapal]]" [[Monster Card|monsters]] ("Entermate" in the OCG and Japanese anime), as with [[Reed Pepper]]'s "[[Cookpal]]" monsters. "Entermage" even receives a near-identical abbreviation in the Japanese to "Entermate"– differentiated only by letter case ("Performage"/"Entermage" is "Em" while "Performapal"/"Entermate" is "EM")– as well as featuring cross-archetype support with "Performapal" through "[[Bubble Barrier]]".

  ==Playing style==
  When the first three Effect Monsters were revealed, and the rarely seen or mentioned "[[Performage Stilts Launcher|Stilts Launcher]]" (With "[[Performage Flame Eater]]" being the only native card that could trigger it's second effect), they instantly became assets to "[[Chaos]]"-like and Rank 4 based Decks. Two prominent examples were "[[Shaddoll]]" and "[[Nekroz]]" before both becoming restricted soon after the release of this archetype and "[[Elder Entity Norden]]".

  "[[Performage Damage Juggler|Damage Juggler]]" and "[[Performage Plushfire|Plushfire]]" can add "Performage" monsters from the Deck to the hand or Special Summon them from there, respectively.

  As a general rule of thumb, "[[Performage Trick Clown|Trick Clown]]" should be the first to be Special Summoned or searched as it can repeat itself when used as any kind of Material for an Extra Deck Summon, and if possible should use its effect only when "[[Performage Hat Tricker|Hat Tricker]]" is already on the field to negate the 1000 Life Point cost of "Trick Clown". It is difficult to make "Hat Tricker" reach 3300 ATK without multiple activations of "Plushfire", however.

  "[[Performage Mirror Conductor|Mirror Conductor]]" is the Main Deck power play of the Performages. Its Pendulum Effect brings ATK and DEF to whichever is lowest and its monster effect switches the two, which is an asset as it can be used during either player's turn.

  "[[Performage Trapeze Magician|Trapeze Magician]]" can let your monsters attack twice to try to achieve an OTK, removing your own Xyz Monsters that have no materials, or destroying an opponent's Monster in Main Phase 2.

  "[[Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer]]" and its Synchro counterpart, "[[Ignister Prominence, the Blasting Dracoslayer]]", have destruction effects to activate the Special Summoning effect of "Plushfire" and both the "[[Dracoslayer]]" and "Performage" archetypes can rapidly Special Summon monsters from the Main Deck.

  "[[King of the Feral Imps]]" can search the Level 4 Tuner "[[Masked Chameleon]]", "[[Jigabyte]]", and sometimes "[[X-Saber Palomuro]]" for "[[Naturia Beast]]" with "Hat Tricker".  The combination of "King of the Feral Imps", "Performage" and "Dracoslayer" is commonly called "PePe & Pals" (short for Performage Pendulum).

  "[[Heroic Challenger - Assault Halberd]]" can search for "[[Heroic Challenger - Thousand Blades]]", which can be combined with "Trick Clown" to Summon multiple Rank 4 Xyz Monsters. This is known as the "[[Clownblade]]" engine.

  Historically Performage was extremely effective when paired with the "[[Performapal]]" archetype. This combination of the two archetypes, known as "PePe", would prove extremely powerful and several of its key cards would be Limited or Forbidden in [[February 2016 Lists|February 2016]].
