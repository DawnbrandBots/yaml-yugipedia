  "'''Synchro Dragon'''" (シンクロ・ドラゴン ''Shinkuro Doragon'') is an [[archetype]] of [[WIND]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yugo]] and [[Yuya Sakaki]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. It is inherently related to the "[[Clear Wing]]" archetype. All members of this archetype are [[Dragon]] [[Synchro Monster]]s, except for the [[Spellcaster]] [[Pendulum Monster]] "[[White Wing Magician]]".

  == Playing style ==
  "Synchro Dragon" monsters focus on negating the activation of a specific [[card type|type]] or effect once per turn, then Synchro Monsters destroys said card. The monster may also gain ATK by negating and destroying this way or by other means.

  === With "Fusion Dragon", "Xyz Dragon" and "Pendulum Dragon" ===
  The play style offered by using the "[[Fusion Dragon]]", "Synchro Dragon", "[[Xyz Dragon]]" and "[[Pendulum Dragon]]" archetypes together is desgined to interact with "[[Supreme King Z-ARC]]". Both "[[Astrograph Sorcerer]]" and "[[Chronograph Sorcerer]]" can banish monsters of the four archetypes to Summon "Supreme King Z-ARC". In contrast, "[[The Supreme King's Soul]]" is the complete reverse of this, which can Special Summon "Z-ARC" without using any materials (though its effects are negated) but it can banish "Z-ARC" to Special Summon monsters from the four archetypes.
