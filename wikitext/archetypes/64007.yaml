  ==Playing Style==
  "Bamboo Sword" is an archetype that can become a draw engine in [[Equip Card]] decks or become a control element within the Duel thanks to "Burning Bamboo Sword", that [[Skips Main Phase 1]] and "Soul Devouring Bamboo Sword" which turns any monster equipped into the [[Forbidden]] "[[Yata-Garasu]]". "Golden Bamboo Sword" allows the controller of a "Bamboo Sword" Equip Spell to Draw 2 Cards. "Cursed Bamboo Sword" is an upgraded version of the central card that can allow the monster to Attack Directly and can search for a "Bamboo Sword" Card when sent to the Graveyard.
  "Bamboo Swords" are typically seen in "[[Infernoble Knight]]"/[[Gemini monster|Gemini]] Decks or Decks that focus on ""[[Fairy Tail - Rella]]" to Equip a "Bamboo Sword" directly from the deck.
  ==Weaknesses==
  * "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]", "[[Imperial Order]]" and "[[Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell]]" can prevent this Deck from functioning.
  * "[[Ghost Belle & Haunted Mansion]]" and "[[D.D. Crow]]" can prevent the player from recovering destroyed copies of "[[Cursed Bamboo Sword]]" or "[[Broken Bamboo Sword]]".
  * As four of the five "Bamboo Sword" cards are [[Equip Spell Card]]s and remain on the [[field]] after being played, Spell/[[Trap]] removal effects such as those of "[[Harpie's Feather Duster]]" and "[[Twin Twisters]]" can heavily damage the Deck.
