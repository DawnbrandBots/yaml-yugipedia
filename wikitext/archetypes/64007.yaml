  "'''Bamboo Sword'''" ({{Ruby|竹|たけ}}{{Ruby|光|みつ}} ''Takemitsu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card]]s, with each card released in a different [[Booster Pack]]. All members of this archetype are [[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous]] or [[Equip Spell Card]]s, except for the [[Normal Spell Card]] "[[Golden Bamboo Sword]]".

  Peculiarly, despite every "Bamboo Sword" Equip Spells does not give any stat change, it has an effect that specified that the equipped monster "gains 0 ATK".

  ==Playing Style==
  The "Bamboo Sword" archetype that can become a draw engine in [[Equip Card]] Decks or become a control element within the Duel thanks to "[[Burning Bamboo Sword]]", which skips the opponent's [[Main Phase 1]], and "Soul Devouring Bamboo Sword", which skips the opponent's [[Draw Phase]]. "[[Cursed Bamboo Sword]]" is an upgraded version of "[[Broken Bamboo Sword]]", which allows the [[equip]]ped monster to attack directly and it can [[search]] for a "Bamboo Sword" Card when it is sent to the [[Graveyard]].

  "Bamboo Swords" are typically seen in "[[Infernoble Knight]]"/[[Gemini monster|Gemini]] Decks or Decks that focus on ""[[Fairy Tail - Rella]]" to equip a "Bamboo Sword" directly from the Deck.

  ==Weaknesses==
  * "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]", "[[Imperial Order]]" and "[[Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell]]" can prevent this Deck from functioning.
  * "[[Ghost Belle & Haunted Mansion]]" and "[[D.D. Crow]]" can prevent the player from recovering destroyed copies of "[[Cursed Bamboo Sword]]" or "[[Broken Bamboo Sword]]".
  * As four of the five "Bamboo Sword" cards are [[Equip Spell Card]]s and remain on the [[field]] after being played, Spell/[[Trap]] removal effects such as those of "[[Harpie's Feather Duster]]" and "[[Twin Twisters]]" can heavily damage the Deck.
