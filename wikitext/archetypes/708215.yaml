  "'''Phantasm'''" ({{Ruby|幻|げん}}{{Ruby|魔|ま}} ''Genma'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] [[Fusion Monster]]s that are associated with the [[Sacred Beasts]].

  They are only supported by one card, "[[Dimension Fusion Destruction]]", which, as a "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Fusion]]" card, currently works with only three of the members: "[[Armityle the Chaos Phantasm]]", "[[Armityle the Chaos Phantasm - Phantom of Fury]]" and "[[Phantasm Emperor Trilojig]]". "Armityle" is used by [[Yubel (character)|Yubel]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime and is the merger of all three Sacred Beasts, while "Trilojig" is used by [[Eve]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' manga and was modelled after the Sacred Beasts.

  A number of cards, such as "[[Phantasmal Lord Ultimitl Bishbaalkin]]", "[[Harpie's Pet Phantasmal Dragon‎]]", "[[Dream Mirror Phantasms]]", and the entire "[[Phantasm Spiral]]" archetype, include "Phantasm" in their English names but are not part of this archetype, as their Japanese names do not contain {{Ruby|幻|げん}}{{Ruby|魔|ま}}. However, because ''TCG''/''OCG'' support for this archetype only works on Fusion Monsters in the [[Extra Deck]], none are an issue.
