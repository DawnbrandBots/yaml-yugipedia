  "'''Elemental HERO'''" ({{Ruby|Ｅ・ＨＥＲＯ|エレメンタルヒーロー}} ''Erementaru Hīrō'') is a "[[HERO]]" sub-[[archetype]] of monsters used by both [[Jaden Yuki]] and [[Aster Phoenix]] (for a period of time until the latter changed to the "[[Destiny HERO]]" archetype) in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. The former also used this archetype, along with his mentor [[Koyo Hibiki]], in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' manga. All members of this sub-archetype are [[Warrior]] monsters, except for the [[Plant]] "[[Elemental HERO Knospe]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Poison Rose]]"; the [[Pyro]] "[[Elemental HERO Heat]]", "[[Elemental HERO Inferno]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Lady Heat]]"; the [[Thunder]] "[[Elemental HERO Voltic]]"; and the [[Spellcaster]] "[[Elemental HERO Neos Kluger]]".

  They were designed by [[Kazuki Takahashi]], and are based on comic-book superheroes in the anime and on natural elements in the manga.

  "Elemental HERO" Decks focus heavily on [[Fusion Summon]]ing. Most of these fall into two primary "Elemental HERO" monsters categories that can be fused with one another: [[Normal Monster]]s from the anime (monsters that are specifically required as materials for Fusion Summons) and the manga counterparts that also have effects (while the [[Fusion Monster]]s require generic [[Fusion Material]]s).

  ==Groups==
  "[[Elemental HERO Avian]]", "[[Elemental HERO Burstinatrix|Burstinatrix]]", "[[Elemental HERO Clayman|Clayman]]", and "[[Elemental HERO Bubbleman|Bubbleman]]" are based on the four elements (which are reflected in their [[Attribute]]s: [[WIND]], [[FIRE]], [[EARTH]], and [[WATER]], respectively). There is at least one [[Fusion Monster]] for each pair of them (except "Avian" and "Clayman"), as well as "[[Elemental HERO Electrum]]", which is a Fusion of all 4.

  "[[Elemental HERO Bladedge]]", "[[Elemental HERO Wildheart|Wildheart]]", and "[[Elemental HERO Necroshade|Necroshade]]" are often grouped together because there is at least one Fusion Monster for each pair of them (except "Bladedge" and "Necroshade").

  "[[Elemental HERO Sparkman]]" was introduced very early on and is usually depicted in the artwork of cards like "[[Fifth Hope]]" and "[[HERO's Bond]]". "Sparkman" has the most Fusion Monsters of any "Elemental HERO" monster, other than "[[Elemental HERO Neos]]", with a total of 6 ("[[Elemental HERO Thunder Giant|Thunder Giant]]", "[[Elemental HERO Tempest|Tempest]]", "[[Elemental HERO Shining Flare Wingman|Shining Flare Wingman]]", "[[Elemental HERO Shining Phoenix Enforcer|Shining Phoenix Enforcer]]", "[[Elemental HERO Plasma Vice|Plasma Vice]]", and "[[Elemental HERO Darkbright|Darkbright]]").

  "[[Elemental HERO Neo Bubbleman]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Clay Guardian|Clay Guardian]]" can be [[Special Summon]]ed by the [[Forbidden]] card "[[Metamorphosis]]".

  "[[Elemental HERO Neos]]" has instead his own support, along with the "[[Neo-Spacian]]" monsters. [[Contact Fusion]] is the main mechanic of "Neos". However, it also has Fusion Monsters with other series of cards such as the "[[Ultimate Crystal God]]" monsters ("[[Rainbow Neos]]"), the "[[Yubel (archetype)|Yubel]]" monsters ("[[Elemental HERO Neos Kluger]]"), and the "Elemental HERO" [[Fusion Monster]]s ("[[Elemental HERO Shining Neos Wingman]]").

  The [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (manga)|manga]] "Elemental HERO" monsters (unoffically called "Omni Heroes") are also grouped together since they do not have Fusion Monsters with the anime "Elemental HERO" monsters. They include "[[Elemental HERO Ocean]]", "[[Elemental HERO Woodsman|Woodsman]]", "[[Elemental HERO Heat|Heat]]", and "[[Elemental HERO Lady Heat|Lady Heat]]".

  "[[Elemental HERO Stratos]]", "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist|Shadow Mist]]", "[[Elemental HERO Blazeman|Blazeman]]", "[[Elemental HERO Solid Soldier|Solid Soldier]]", "[[Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier|Liquid Soldier]]" are considered a group of their own due to their better effect and [[ATK]].

  ==Design==
  The "Elemental HERO" monsters are based after the western comics' heroes. In the Japanese version, their naming scheme is "Elemental HERO [Term related to its element] -man" (for the male monsters, with the exceptions of "[[Elemental HERO Prisma]]" and every "[[Neos]]" monster). The only female "Elemetal HERO" monsters are "[[Elemental HERO Burstinatrix]]", "[[Elemental HERO Lady Heat|Lady Heat]]", "[[Elemental HERO Poison Rose|Poison Rose]]", and "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist|Shadow Mist]]" (the first two have "Lady" instead of "Man" in their Japanese name). Some of the names were changed in the English ''[[TCG]]''.

  As the name says, the "Elemental HERO" monsters each represent an element of nature. In western culture, the main elements are fire, water, air, earth, light and darkness, but in eastern culture, more elements are considered, such as lightning, wood, metal, and ice, though ice is many times not considered since it is another form of water.

  The manga does not have the same theme as the anime, but the monsters are still based around those same elements.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Elemental HERO" archetype has many [[Main Deck]] monsters and [[Extra Deck]] [[Fusion Monster]]s, each with their own varied effects. Historically, the archetype can be built to focus on their Main Deck monsters or their Fusion Monsters; currently in 2022, the Main Deck "Elemental HERO" monsters are too weak in contrast to the general power level of the game, and later "Elemental HERO" support leaned into their [[Fusion Summon]]ing playstyle, meaning that the Extra Deck playstyle is preferred for this archetype.

  The pure "Elemental HERO" playstyle aims to Fusion Summon their Extra Deck Fusion boss monsters by [[search]]ing out their required [[Fusion Material]]s and Fusion [[Spell Card]]s as quickly as possible. This can be done through a combination of specific "Elemental HERO" support cards (e.g. "[[E - Emergency Call]]"), generic "[[HERO]]" support cards (e.g. "[[Vision HERO Vyon]]"), and non-archetypal [[Warrior]]/Fusion support cards (e.g. "[[Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights]]").

  The "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monsters typically have battle-focused effects with little defensive capabilities. Most "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monsters also require Fusion Materials with specific names, but some of them have generic [[material]]s and are much easier to summon. The 6 most notable ones are "[[Elemental HERO Great Tornado]]", "[[Elemental HERO Nova Master|Nova Master]]", "[[Elemental HERO The Shining|The Shining]]", "[[Elemental HERO Escuridao|Escuridao]]", "[[Elemental HERO Absolute Zero|Absolute Zero]]", and "[[Elemental HERO Gaia|Gaia]]", which require 1 "Elemental HERO" monster and a monster with a specific [[Attribute]] as their materials. Among these 6, "Escuridao" and "Absolute Zero" are the most commonly used, because "Escuridao's" [[DARK]] Attribute is ubiquitous, and "Absolute Zero" has a very strong effect, and also only requires a "HERO" monster rather than an "Elemental HERO" monster as its material, making it even easier to Summon in a general "HERO" [[Deck]].

  An "Elemental HERO" Deck can consider running "[[King of the Swamp]]" and other [[Fusion Substitute Monster]]s to substitute for "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monsters with specified materials.

  ===Other "HERO" support===
  Within the entire "[[HERO]]" meta-archetype, the "Elemental HERO" archetypal playstyle is strongly supported by the "[[Vision HERO]]" combo

  "[[Vision HERO Faris|Faris]]" → "[[Vision HERO Increase|Increase]]" → "[[Vision HERO Vyon|Vyon]]"

  Since "Vyon" can search out "[[Polymerization]]" and can [[send]] "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]" to the [[GY]] to search out more needed "Elemental HERO" monsters. The "Vision HERO" [[Fusion Monster]]s, "[[Vision Hero Adoration|Adoration]]" and "[[Vision HERO Trinity|Trinity]]", are also good options for an "Elemental HERO" Deck to run due to their generic [[material]]s.

  The "[[Xtra HERO]]" [[Link Monster]]s provide many helpful benefits to the "Elemental HERO" playstyle. "[[Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer|Infernal Devicer]]" can directly search out up to 2 listed [[Fusion Material]]s on a "HERO" Fusion Monster, making it most strongly support the "Elemental HERO" playstyle of [[Fusion Summon]]ing monsters with specific materials. "[[Xtra HERO Wonder Driver|Wonder Driver]]" can recover Fusion [[Spell Card]]s, making it useful for longer combos or grind games.

  ===How "Elemental HERO" supports other "HERO" sub-archetypes===
  On the other side, the "Elemental HERO" archetype (specifically, a few individual members) are vital combo pieces to the overall "[[HERO]]" meta-archetype playstyle. The most important "Elemental HERO" monster with regards to the entire "HERO" archetype is "[[Elemental HERO Stratos]]", a non-once-per-turn searcher for all "HERO" monsters and the ideal target for "[[A Hero Lives]]". "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]" is a once-per-turn searcher for all "HERO" monsters when [[sent]] to the [[GY]] (usually by "[[Vision HERO Vyon]]"), but it is also a searcher for "[[Change]]" [[Spell Card]]s, which enables the [[Special Summon]] of the powerful "[[Masked HERO]]" monsters (most notably "[[Masked HERO Dark Law|Dark Law]]" and "[[Masked HERO Acid|Acid]]", usually Summoned by using "Absolute Zero" to perform a board wipe); the variety of [[Attribute]]s the "Elemental HERO" monsters have makes them ideal for summoning "Masked HERO" monsters, making "Masked HERO" monsters good options even in a pure "Elemental HERO" build.

  "[[Elemental HERO Solid Soldier]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier|Liquid Soldier]]" are good monsters to [[Normal Summon]], as they can [[Special Summon]] needed "HERO" monsters (usually "Shadow Mist" to search for "[[Mask Change]]"). Lastly, "[[Elemental HERO Honest Neos|Honest Neos]]" is an [[ATK]]-booster for all "HERO" monsters, and "[[Elemental HERO Sunrise|Sunrise]]" is a [[Fusion Monster]] with generic "HERO" [[Fusion Material]]s that can search out "[[Miracle Fusion]]", a powerful Fusion Spell Card that can use monsters in the [[GY]] as Fusion Materials, allowing a Fusion Summon with zero card loss to the [[field]] advantage.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * "Elemental HERO" monsters often lack protection, and has such the player can often easily have their [[field]] cleared by mass destruction cards and effects like "[[Dark Hole]]".
  * Pure "Elemental HERO" monsters have very weak disruption and oppression power, having little ability to disrupt or prevent the opponent's plays.
  * "[[Gozen Match]]" can significantly disrupt a pure "Elemental HERO" Deck due to their variety of [[Attribute]]s.
  * As all "Elemental HERO" non-[[Contact Fusion|Contact]] Fusion Monsters [[Nomi|cannot be]] [[Special Summon]]ed in other ways than [[Fusion Summon]], cards like "[[Non-Fusion Area]]" can lock these Fusion Monsters down. Furthermore, cards like "[[Nekroz of Unicore]]" can have their effects negated.
  * As "Elemental HERO" monsters are mostly Warrior-Type, cards such as "[[Cipher Soldier]]" and the side deck "[[Warrior Elimination]]" can pose as a threat to such decks.
