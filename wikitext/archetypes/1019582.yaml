  "'''Goblin Rider'''" (ゴブリンライダー ''Goburin Raidā'') is a "[[Goblin]]" sub-[[archetype]] of [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 3 monsters with 0 [[DEF]] introduced in ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]''.

  This archetype is related to the "[[Diabellstar]]" archetype.

  == Etymology ==
  In the OCG, the reading "Goblin Rider" is is applied to the kanji "百鬼羅刹", a portmanteau of "百鬼夜行" (''hyakki yagyou'', [[wikipedia:Hyakki Yagyō|Night Parade of a Hundred Demons]]) and "悪鬼羅刹" (''akki rasetsu'', demons and [[wikipedia:Rakshasa|rakshasa]].)

  == Appearance ==
  Compared to the older "[[Goblin]]" monsters, "Goblin Rider" monsters features the more modern "[[wikipedia:Gremlin|gremlin]]-like" design. Each "Goblin Riders" are smaller in size compared to traditional "Goblin" while having more animalistic features, such as very large rat-like ears and some having body parts of other animals. Each "Goblin Riders" rides tamed beasts and outfitted themselves with a biker gang-themed outfits.  
  == Playing style ==
  "Goblin Rider" is a theme focused on their ability to swarm the [[Field|field]] with numerous "[[Goblin]]" monsters through not just their own effects if [[Normal Summon|Normal]] or [[Special Summon|Special Summoned]], but through a shared effect to [[Detach|detach]] 1 [[Xyz Material]] from an [[Xyz Monster]] on either player's field to Special Summon that monster to the player's field. As a result, the theme is able to create a variety of boards based on which Xyz Monsters are summoned to the field, usually benefitting most from those able to have many Xyz Materials to detach through their own effects.

  One of the main benefits of the theme is its [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card|Trap]] lineup that help to further benefit its Playing style. The [[Continuous Spell Card]], "[[Grand Meeting of the Goblin Riders]]", is of particular note as it not only gives all "Goblin" monsters on the field more ATK and an additional Normal Summon, it contains the effect to target 2 "Goblin" monsters and either make the [[Level]] of one of the targets become the same as the other monster's Level or make both of their Levels become the combined total. This allows the theme to make a wider range of Xyz Monsters, most predominantly Rank 6 and 7 Xyz monsters, as well as expands their ability to [[Synchro Summon]] with the optional tech "[[Scrap Goblin]]" to make powerful Level 12 [[Synchro Monster]]s such as "[[Ultimaya Tzolkin]]" and even "[[Geomathmech Final Sigma]]".
