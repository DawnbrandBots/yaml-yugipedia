  "'''Ninja'''" ({{Ruby|忍|にん}}{{Ruby|者|じゃ}} ''Ninja'') is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They are supported by the "[[Ninjitsu Art]]" Spell and Trap Card archetype. A handful of the "Ninja" cards existed in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|TCG]]'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game|OCG]]'' prior to being united by support cards in later sets. Characters that used "Ninja" decks in the anime include [[Jean-Claude Magnum]], [[Kaze]], [[Moon Shadow]] and [[Sun Shadow]].

  While they are primarily Warrior-Type, several "Ninja" cards are part of the "[[Karakuri]]" and "[[Superheavy Samurai]]" archetypes, which are [[Machine]]-Type instead. The [[Dragon Ninja]] series are a variety of types, due to aligning with the effects of "[[Ninjitsu Art of Transformation]]" and "[[Ninjitsu Art of Super-Transformation]]".

  "Ninja" were a candidate to be released in [[Collection Pack 2020]] and received 2.8% of votes in the poll, coming in 7th place. These were specifically going to be "Ninja" cards used by Jean-Claude Magnum.

  ==Origin==
  "[[Goe Goe the Gallant Ninja]]", "[[Masked Ninja Ebisu]]", "[[Lady Ninja Yae]]", and "[[Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke]]" are characters based on [[Konami]]'s popular video game series ''[[wikipedia:Legend of the Mystical Ninja|Legend of the Mystical Ninja]]''. Incidentally, all the [[Sasuke Samurai (series)|Sasuke Samurai]] monsters are from this series, as well.

  ==Playing style==
  The Spell, Trap, and Monster cards of the "Ninja" archetype revolve around control-based strategies.

  For offensive examples, "[[Strike Ninja]]" can temporarily remove itself from the Field (dodging a card effect). "[[Ninja Grandmaster Sasuke|Sasuke]]" can bypass walls such as "[[Marshmallon]]" and higher DEF Monsters. Other "Ninja" tend to work behind the scenes, such as the effect of "[[Upstart Golden Ninja]]" for summoning, and the effect of "[[Ninja Grandmaster Hanzo]]" [[toolbox]]ing effect.

  "Ninja" Decks can be made in a variety of ways, but since Ninja-specific support is few and far in between, most of their abilities are far from game-breaking, making them more of an uncommon rogue Deck to use. However, they can excel against [[Stall Deck]]s that revolve around a particular card. The [[Ninjitsu Art of Transformation|transformation]] [[Ninjitsu Art of Super-Transformation|traps]] in their arsenal give "Ninja" splashability with "[[Mist Valley]]", "[[Chaos]]", "[[Dragon]]", "[[Dark Simorgh Lockdown]]", and "[[Monarch (series)|Monarch]]" Decks, among others.

  [[WIND]] and/or [[Winged Beast]]-oriented Decks aid "[[Lady Ninja Yae]]", while [[DARK]] monsters will keep up the stealth of "[[Strike Ninja]]". "[[Dark Simorgh]]" is DARK, WIND and Winged Beast, giving support to not only the above Ninja and "[[Ninja Grandmaster Hanzo|Hanzo]]", but is an ideal target for "[[Ninjitsu Art of Transformation]]".

  "[[Roc from the Valley of Haze]]" can return to the Deck once he is discarded by "Yae" to become her transformation target within the same turn.

  "[[Armed Ninja]]" and "[[Crimson Ninja]]" may be paired with such cards as "[[Ninjitsu Art of Duplication]]" and "[[Senior Silver Ninja]]", both of which enable the weak "Ninja" to swarm the Field, ready to Flip.

  "[[White Dragon Ninja]]" is meant to be paired with "Super-Transformation" by means of her own effect that protects the controlling player's back-row. This card has a strong synergy with the card "[[Safe Zone]]" as they both protect each other.

  "[[Armor Ninjitsu Art of Alchemy]]" was made for removing [[Ninjitsu Art]] cards once they have outlived their use. "[[Magic Planter]]" and "[[Uria, Lord of Searing Flames]]" can also profit off of a "Ninjitsu Art"-heavy Deck. Although slow, "[[Karakuri Ninja mdl 339 "Sazank"]]" is another useful tool for dispatching an enemy monster that might have bypassed one's Traps and other Monsters. 

  In a Warrior-only "Ninja" Deck, "[[The Immortal Bushi]]" can be used to Tribute Set "Senior Silver Ninja" and start the swarming.

  ===Weaknessess===
  There are ways to break the [[Safe Zone]] and [[White Dragon Ninja]] lock once it has been completed, such as using [[Trap Stun]] to temporarily remove Safe Zone's protection from White Dragon Ninja, using [[Trap Eater]] to remove Safe Zone (since it doesn't destroy), using [[Book of Eclipse]] to flip White Dragon Ninja face-down (since it doesn't target or destroy), both removing Safe Zone's protection and temporarily nullifying White Dragon Ninja's effect, or using [[Skill Drain]].

  == Trivia ==
  * "[[Barrier Ninjitsu Art of Transcription]]", "[[Blind Spot Strike]]", "[[Spy Attack]]", and "[[Debunk]]" suggest that "Ninja" have some sort of rivalry with the "[[Shien]]". Also, "[[Ninjitsu Art of Super-Transformation]]" implies a rivalry between the "Ninja" and the "[[Karakuri]]" monsters, despite the fact that some monsters are members of both archetypes.
