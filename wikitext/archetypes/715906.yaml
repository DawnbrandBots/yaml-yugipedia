  "'''Mikanko'''" ({{Ruby|御巫|みかんこ}} ''Mikanko'') is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Amazing Defenders]]''/''[[Amazing Defenders]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 07: Mikanko}}

  == Etymology ==
  "Mikanko" is a complex wordplay with multiples references. It is a play on ''mikan'' ({{Ruby|蜜柑|みかん}}, "citrus") and ''ko'' ({{Ruby|子|こ}}, "child"), meaning it effectively sounds like "citrus girl" - this is reflected by the emblem of theme resembling both the [[wikipedia:Imperial Seal of Japan|Imperial Seal of Japan]] and a lemon slice.

  "[[Ohime the Manifested Mikanko]]" is named after the Japanese sun goddess ''[[wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu]]'', while the other "Mikanko" members are named after descendants of ''Amaterasu'' who inherited her [[wikipedia:Imperial Regalia of Japan|three sacred treasures]].

  == Playing style ==
  "Mikanko" is an [[Equip Spell Card]]-based theme with some [[Ritual Monster]]-based support. Its playstyle revolves around using Equip Spells as combo tools, effect enablers, and disruption. All of its monsters also have effects that can [[Your opponent takes battle damage|reflect battle damage]] back at the opponent; the Deck generally aims to go second and set up damage-reflection-based [[OTK]]s, but could play a more control-oriented strategy and set up Equip-based disruptions and recursion.

  All "Mikanko" monsters have 0 [[ATK]]/[[DEF]], and have effects that can prevent battle destruction and reflect battle damage. For the non-Ritual Monsters, this effect is only active if they are equipped with [[Equip Card]]s, while the Ritual Monsters always have the effect. Each "Mikanko" non-Ritual Monster also gain additional effects if or while they are equipped with Equips; "[[Ha-Re the Sword Mikanko|Ha-Re]]" searches "Mikanko" Equip Spells, "[[Ni-Ni the Mirror Mikanko|Ni-Ni]]" gains a [[Quick Effect]] [[List of unofficial terms#Snatch Steal|stealing]] effect, and "[[Hu-Li the Jewel Mikanko|Hu-Li]]" grants targeting protection and searches "Mikanko" Traps.

  The Deck's core searcher is "[[Ohime the Manifested Mikanko]]", who can activate its effect in the hand to search any "Mikanko" card. Other important searchers are the aformentioned "Ha-Re" and "Hu-Li", "[[Mikanko Water Arabesque|Water Arabesque]]" described below, as well as the GY effect of "[[The Great Mikanko Ceremony]]", a send-to-GY searcher.

  Each of the Deck's Equip Spells have different functions; most also prevent their equipped monster from being destroyed by effects.
  * "[[Mikanko Water Arabesque|Water Arabesque]]" is a summon-from-Deck searcher and a monster removal (by equipping it onto enemy monsters).
  * "[[Mikanko Reflection Rondo|Reflection Rondo]]" is a monster steal.
  * "[[Mikanko Purification Dance|Purification Dance]]" is a bounce disruption.
  * "[[Mikanko Fire Dance|Fire Dance]]" is a revival and a setup for battle damage reflection.
  * "[[Mikanko Dance - Mayowashidori|Mayowashidori]]" is a revival from GY and a battle phase removal.

  Other "Mikanko" Spells and Traps, as well as the on-field effects of "Ohime", provide additional searchable utility across a wide range of effects related to "Mikanko" Main Deck monsters and Equip Spells.

  As a go-first control strategy, "Mikanko" aims to tutor out its Spell Speed 2 disruption points (e.g. "Ni-Ni", a summoned "Ohime", "Purification Dance", "[[Mikanko Spiritwalk|Spiritwalk]]", "[[Mikanko Rivalry|Rivalry]]") and out-grind the opponent over turns 2 and 3. As a go-second OTK strategy, "Mikanko" aims to quickly remove opposing disruptions while leaving behind high ATK monsters, that "Mikanko" monsters can attack into for a damage reflection OTK.

  Due to "Ha-Re" being a [[FIRE]] [[Warrior]], the deck is compartible with various "[[Infernoble Knight]]" and generic FIRE support. Both of which allows the "Mikanko" player to explosively set up their board either when going first or second, using "Ha-Re" as a bridge to several combos.

  Aside from being a deck on its own, the searching power offered by "Ohime" and the versatility of "[[Mikanko Water Arabesque]]" also means that "Mikanko" can function as a compact engine in other decks, providing various forms of "Mikanko"-based utility (e.g. removal + summon, Spell Speed 2 steal, etc).

  ===Weaknesses===
  * As "Mikanko" Deck is entirely reliant on dealing reflect damage, the Deck fares poorly against Decks that summons little to no monsters or using monsters with 0 ATK/DEF. Such as the [[Burn Deck|burn]] variant of "[[Timelord]]" Deck.
  * "[[Skill Drain]]" and "[[Scareclaw Kashtira]]" can pose a serious threat to "Mikanko" player, as both can easily disable the damage reflection effect and bypass the targeting protection of "Hu-Li".
  * Since "Mikanko" theme utilize a large number of [[Equip Spell Card]], players may often have their [[Spell & Trap Zone]] to be clogged by their own cards, thus preventing them from activating any other Spell/Trap on their hand.
  * Being a backrow-heavy Deck, mass Spell & Trap or non-target removal effect (such as "[[Harpie's Feather Duster]]") can easily disable the effects of the Level 3 "Mikanko" monsters.
