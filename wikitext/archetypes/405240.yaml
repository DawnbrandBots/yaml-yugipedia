  "'''Xyz Dragon'''" (エクシーズ・ドラゴン ''Ekushīzu Doragon'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yuto]] and [[Yuya Sakaki]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. It is related to the "[[Rebellion (archetype)|Rebellion]]" archetype.

  It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Xyz (archetype)|Xyz]]" archetype, and it is made up by 4 [[Dragon]] [[Xyz Monster]]s ("[[Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon|Dark Rebellion]]", its [[Card evolutions|evolution]]s "[[Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon|Dark Requiem]]" and "[[Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon|Arc Rebellion]]", and "[[Odd-Eyes Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]", a [[Xyz Pendulum Monster|Xyz Pendulum]] combined form of "Arc Rebellion" and "[[Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]]") and 1 [[Spellcaster]] [[Pendulum Monster]] ("[[Black Fang Magician]]", which has an [[archetype condition]] that makes it a member despite its name).

  ==Playing style==
  Most "Xyz Dragon" monsters have effects that lower the ATK of opponent's monsters, with the Xyz Monsters also gaining the lost amount. This allows decks using the "Xyz Dragon" monsters to finish off their opponent, with the most potent being "[[Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]" which can gain huge amounts of ATK in a field of numerous monsters. "Arc Rebellion" can also be easily Summoned via "[[Raider's Knight]]". However, "[[Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon]]" is more useful for disruption as it can also negate monster effect activations (then destroying them) that has neither a once per turn or a once per chain activation restriction as long as it has "[[Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]" as material. 

  Meanwhile, "[[Odd-Eyes Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]" can destroy up to two of the opponent's monsters despite not having any ATK increasing effects.

  Being almost an entirely Extra Deck archetype, "Xyz Dragon" monsters and their support are best used in various DARK decks (in particular, "[[Phantom Knights]]" and "[[Magician]]") that can easily make "[[Raider's Knight]]" (and "Arc Rebellion"). Likewise, such decks are also able to utilize "Dark Rebellion" and "Dark Requiem" if one uses "Phantom Knights" cards (such as "[[The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche]]" to fetch "[[Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force]]").

  === With "Fusion Dragon", "Synchro Dragon" and "Pendulum Dragon" ===
  The play style offered by using the "[[Fusion Dragon]]", "[[Synchro Dragon]]", "Xyz Dragon" and "[[Pendulum Dragon]]" archetypes together is desgined to interact with "[[Supreme King Z-ARC]]". Both "[[Astrograph Sorcerer]]" and "[[Chronograph Sorcerer]]" can banish monsters of the four archetypes to Summon "Supreme King Z-ARC". In contrast, "[[Soul of the Supreme King]]" is the complete reverse of this, which can Special Summon "Z-ARC" without using any materials (though its effects are negated) but it can banish "Z-ARC" to Special Summon monsters from the four archetypes.
