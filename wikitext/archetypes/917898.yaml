  "'''Manadome'''" (マナドゥム ''Manadumu'') is an [[archetype]] of primarily [[Fairy]] monsters introduced in ''[[Cyberstorm Access]]''.

  ==Etymology==

  ==Design==
  The artworks for "[[Manadome Hearless]]" and "[[Manadome Meek]]" depict orbs on a tree featuring the worlds of the "[[Scareclaw]]", "[[Primitive Planet Reichphobia]]", as well as the "[[Tearlaments]]", "[[Primeval Planet Perlereino]]", while "[[Manadome Riumheart]]" is an observer to these events.

  ==Playing style==
  "Manadome" is a [[Synchro Summon|Synchro]] archetype focused on destroying their own monsters through various effects, such as the effect of "[[Visas Starfrost]]", to generate more resources for Synchro Summons. Both [[Level]] 2 [[Tuner monster]]s, "[[Manadome Hearless]] and "[[Manadome Meek]]", share the same general effects to [[Special Summon]] themselves from the [[Hand|hand]] if you control either "Visas Starfrost" or a monster with 1500 ATK/2100 DEF on the field and the ability to Special Summon another copy of themselves from the Deck when destroyed by battle or card effect with an additional effect; either increasing the ATK of Synchro Monsters for the Battle Phase for "Hearless" or increasing the Level of the next monsters Summoned by 2 for "Meek". This is further enhanced through their [[Field Spell Card]], "[[Primal Planet Kalarium]]" and its ability to resummon a Tuner monster from the GY that was destroyed by battle or card effect once per turn.

  The primary boss of the theme is "[[Manadome Prime-Heart]]", A Level 10 [[Synchro Monster]] that is unique in that it is the first Synchro Monster since "[[XX-Saber Gottoms]]" that is able to be Synchro Summoned using solely Tuner Monsters. "Prime-Heart" is able to attack multiple times in the [[Battle Phase]] up to how many Tuner Monsters were used to Synchro Summon it with targeting protection and the ability to Special Summon "Visas Starfrost" or a monster with 1500 ATK/2100 DEF that is banished or in the GY when it leaves the field by an opponent's card.

  Generally speaking, "Manadome" is flexible in that it can be used in tandem with the primary lore themes of the [[World Destruction]] series due to various cards supporting "Visas Starfrost" alongside their own archetypes. The best contender for this is "[[Scareclaw]]" however as the theme allows for added consistency to go into strong Synchro and Link plays with the many resources produced by spawning Tuner monsters to the field.

  ==Trivia==
  * The "Manadome" arc of the [[World Destruction]] storyline reverses the roles of "Visas Starfrost" and his counterpart. In the previous arcs with "[[Scareclaw]]", "[[Tearlaments]]", and "[[Kashtira]]", "Visas" is the hero stopping his various evil counterparts. In this arc, "Visas" has become the evil "[[Vicious Astroud]]" and his counterpart is the good guy trying to stop him.  
  * Its implied that the "Manadome" characters, locations, and events take place inside "Visas Starfrost"'s mind, with the Level 2s representing the memories of his prior experiences, "Ruimheart" representing "Visas"'s superego and its battle with "Astroud" representing how the id and superego conflict with one another over what choice the ego should make.
