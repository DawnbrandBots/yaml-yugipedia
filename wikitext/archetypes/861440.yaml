  "'''Runick'''", known as "'''Rune'''" ({{Ruby|神碑|ルーン}} ''Rūn'') in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Tactical Masters]]''/''[[Tactical Masters]]''.

  ==Etymology==
  The [[wikipedia:Runes|runic alphabet]] was a writing system used by ancient Germanic people before the adoption of the Latin alphabet. The Japanese name of the archetype uses the kanji characters 「神碑」 (''Shinpi''), literally meaning "Divine Runestone" (most likely referring to "[[Runick Fountain]]"), and has a forced reading of 「ルーン」 (''Rūn''). 「神碑」 is also homophonous and visually evokes the word「神秘」 (''Shinpi'', "Mystery").

  ==Design==
  The "Runick" monsters are based on [[wikipedia:Norse mythology|Norse mythology]] and Germanic [[wikipedia:Runes|runes]]. They also feature elements from video games, primarily [[wikipedia:Action role-playing game|action RPGs]].

  The artworks of all "Runick" [[Spell Card]]s are drawn from a first-person perspective, usually with the hand of the POV character being visibly in frame. This is likely intended to mimic the appearance of a first-person RPG. Their artworks also each depict a different weapon/ability being used by the POV character, and have different settings.

  The "[[Generaider]]" monsters, which are also based on Norse mythology and video games, are related to this archetype, as evidenced by "[[Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses]]" appearing in the artwork of "[[Runick Allure]]", and the same characters appearing in both "[[Generaider Boss Fight]]" and "[[Runick Dispelling]]".

  ==Playing style==
  "Runick" is an archetype almost entirely made up of [[Spell Card]]s (especially [[Quick-Play Spell]]s), with an exclusive focus on a [[Deck out]] victory condition. The archetype has no [[Main Deck]] monsters, only one monster with non-zero [[ATK]] (who [[Prevents battle damage|cannot deal battle damage]]), and the effects of all its Quick-Play Spells cause the player to skip their next [[Battle Phase]], forcing the archetype to entirely forgo combat to focus on Deck out.

  All "Runick" Quick-Play Spells can be [[activate]]d [[only once per turn]], and each allows choosing between one of two effects: a unique effect that provides consistency/disruption/Deck [[mill]]ing and then [[banish]]es a varied number of cards from the top of the opponent's Deck, or a shared effect to [[Special Summon]] 1 "Runick" monster from the [[Extra Deck]] to the [[Extra Monster Zone]]. Activating either effect of a "Runick" Quick-Play Spell requires the player to skip their next Battle Phase.

  The "Runick" Extra Deck monsters serve as the archetype's defensive strategy, providing additional resource searching or cycling, and some protection against battle or effects.

  The key card to the archetype's resource loop is their [[Field Spell]] "[[Runick Fountain]]", which lets the player activate "Runick" Quick-Play Spells from the [[hand]] during the opponent's turn, and [[once per turn]] (during either player's turn) it can place up to 3 "Runick" Quick-Play Spells from the [[Graveyard]] to the bottom of the Deck and have the player [[draw]] that many cards.

  Though "Runick Fountain" functions best when the archetype is played pure, the archetype's ability to easily [[Special Summon]] low-level [[Fusion Monster]]s also enables the Summoning of [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]], [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]], or [[Link Monster]]s requiring low-Level extenders if the archetype is hybridized with other engines.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Since this archetype focuses mostly on [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s, cards that counter them (or [[Spell Card]]s in general), like "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]" and "[[Secret Village of the Spellcasters]]", can be extremely dangerous.
  * The archetype critically depends on its [[Field Spell]] "[[Runick Fountain]]" to maintain its card advantage, making it a prime target for the opponent's removal effects.
  * The archetype has almost no [[Monster Zone]] presence, and is almost entirely dependent on randomly [[draw]]n "Runick" [[Quick-Play Spell]]s to provide disruption and protection, making it quite fragile.
  * Utilizing external engines, or even external cards in general, reduces the chances of the player drawing into additional "Runick" cards off of "Runick Fountain", slowing down the Deck's tempo significantly.
  * The Deck's playstyle is countered by anti-Graveyard floodgates like "[[Macro Cosmos]]", who can prevent "Runick Fountain" from returning cards to draw cards.
  * [[Deck]]s with cards that [[activate]] their effects when [[banish]]ed, like the "[[Shiranui]]" monsters, could use this archetype's strategy of banishing the opponent's cards to their own advantage.
