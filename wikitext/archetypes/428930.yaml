  "'''Supreme King Gate'''" ({{Ruby|覇|は}}{{Ruby|王|おう}}{{Ruby|門|もん}} ''Haōmon'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Z-ARC]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. It is part of the [[Supreme King]] series.

  == Playing style ==
  "Zero" and "Infinity" offer the complete range for [[Pendulum Summon]]ing, starting from Level 1 and ranging all the way to Level 12 with their respective [[Pendulum Scale]]s of 0 and 13. However, "Infinity" only allows Pendulum Summoning while the user controls no monsters. "Zero" can destroy both itself and "Infinity" so the user may [[add]] a "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" or "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" card to their hand, and remove the negative effect of "Infinity".

  After they are destroyed, they can be Pendulum Summoned back and use their Effect to Special Summon out a specific Extra Deck Dragon monster that can be used as a potential [[Fusion Material]] for "[[Supreme King Z-ARC]]", and after that, they may be placed back in the [[Pendulum Zone]], and thus, repeating the loop as the user can then finally search an appropriate "Fusion" Spell or "Polymerization" Spell that can Fusion Summon "Supreme King Z-ARC".

  "Zero" and "Infinity" also gain additional Pendulum Effects if the user also controls "Supreme King Z-ARC", with "Zero" blocking all [[effect damage]] and "Infinity" being able to gain LP, which can potentially can be used to [[stall]].

  The "Supreme King Gate" cards are supported by some "[[Supreme King Dragon]]" monsters and other related support; "[[Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm]]" and "[[Performapal Duelist Extraordinaire]]" can search a "Supreme King Gate" card, while "[[Supreme King Dragon Odd-Eyes]]" and "[[Supreme King Dragon Dark Rebellion]]" can Tribute or return to the Extra Deck to Special Summon back face-up "Supreme King Gate" monsters from the Extra Deck.
