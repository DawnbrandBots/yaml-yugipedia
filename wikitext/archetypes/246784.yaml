  == Playing style ==
  The "Battlin' Boxer" archetype focuses on Battle Phase advantage and disrupting the opponent via their "[[Battlin' Boxing]]" counter trap card. The deck achieve this mainly by swarming the field as fast as possible to XYZ summon their extra deck monster.

  The 2 main consistency monster of the deck are "[[Battlin' Boxer Uppercutter]]" and "[[Battlin' Boxer Promoter]]", promoter can quickly swarm the field by tributing itself to summon 2 "Battlin' Boxer" and can banish itself to modulate their level, while Uppercutter help search "counter" trap card when it's summon or when it's send to the GY via your card effects.
  Some extender of the deck that these monster can be bring out or search are : "[[Battlin' Boxer Chief Second]]", "[[Battlin' Boxer Glassjaw]]", "[[Battlin' Boxer Shadow]]" and "[[Battlin' Boxer Sparrer]]" which helps swarm the field or recovery.

  The deck also host 4 different hand traps in which 2 can be used in the Gy via banishing which could be setup by "[[Battlin' Boxer Headgeared]]" with two of the most notable one being "[[Battlin' Boxer Counterpunch]]" and "[[Battlin' Boxer Chief Second]]".

  The Extra deck "[[Battlin' Boxer]]" have a varriety of effects raging from setting up disruption with "[[Battlin' Boxer King Dempsey]]" and "[[Number C79: Battlin' Boxer General Kaiser]]" or Dealling a lot of effect damage via battle with "[[Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus]]" and "[[Number C105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus]]". A good bridge between these two style is "[[Number 79: Battlin' Boxer Nova Kaiser]]" who can provide main deck monster for "[[Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus]]" effect and extra body for summoning "[[Number C105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus]]" and "[[Number C79: Battlin' Boxer General Kaiser]]" via level modulation from "[[Battlin' Boxer Promoter]]" or a rank-up magic card for the extra effect.

  Perhaps one of the most unique aspect of the archetype is it's ability to search out trap card with "counter" in it's name making the use of "[[Flamvell Counter]]" very effective in the deck as "[[Battlin' Boxer Uppercutter]]" coincidentally have 200 Def. Some other options include "[[Battlin' Boxing Cross Counter]]" and "[[Jolt Counter]]".
