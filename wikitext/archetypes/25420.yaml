  "'''Frog'''" (ガエル ''Gaeru'') is an [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Aqua]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Cybernetic Revolution]]''. This was both the first WATER archetype and the first Aqua archetype. The archetype is used by [[Princess Rose]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. The "[[Toad]]" series is a related series of monsters that support the "Frog" archetype.

  "[[Froggy Forcefield]]" is not a member of this archetype, as its name does not contain「ガエル」. 

  ==Design==
  True to their their name, the general design of "Frog" as well as the related "Toad" monsters resemble their real-life counterparts. Some "Frog" monsters like "[[Flip Flop Frog]]" and "[[Poison Draw Frog]]" showcase their long, sticky tongues in their artwork. Most of the "Frog" and Toad monsters have distinctive colorful markings on their bodies and heads, most notably "[[Swap Frog]]", "[[Dupe Frog]]", "[[Beelze Frog]]", and "[[Ronintoadin]]".

  Some "Frog" and Toad monsters resemble angels like "[[Treeborn Frog]]", while others resemble demons like "Beelze Frog" and "Swap Frog". This thematic resemblance to angels and demons is further highlighted by the contrasting half-angel, half-demon appearances of "[[Substitoad]]" and "[[Tradetoad]]".

  ===Etymology===
  The Japanese name of the "Frog" archetype, ''gaeru'', is the [[wikipedia:Rendaku|voiced]] form of the word for "frog", ''kaeru''; ''kaeru'' in turn is used in the Japanese names of the Toad monsters. Most ''[[TCG]]'' languages localize ''gaeru'' as "frog" and ''kaeru'' as "toad" in their own languages. In Portuguese, however, the reverse is true: "Frog" is translated as "Sapo" ("toad"), while "Toad" is translated as "Rã" ("frog").

  In the Japanese, the names of "Frog" and Toad monsters are puns on ''gaeru''/''kaeru'', primarily exploiting the fact that many verbs in Japanese end in one of those sequences.

  ==Playing style==
  Though with weak stats, "Frog" monsters are very versatile and their effects include rapid Summoning, the option to increase their ATK or protect themselves from destruction, and wiping out all cards the opponent controls, with "[[Des Croaking]]".

  One card that kept "Frogs" versatile and powerful was "[[Substitoad]]", but after ''[[Frog FTK]]'' won the ''2010 World Championships'', it was [[Forbidden]], so many "Frog" Decks lost their supreme speed.

  Before "[[Monarch]]" monsters gained support through recent years, they were commonly combined with monsters like "Treeborn Frog", "Swap Frog" and "Ronintoadin", that could provide fodders for the Tribute Summons. This granted them popularity and competitive viability and the Deck became known as ''[[Frog Monarch]]''.

  Another popular combination is "[[Sea Lancer]]". It can equip itself with as many banished Aqua, Fish and Sea Serpent monsters as possible, which raises is ATK by 1000 and those targets can be easily provided by "Ronintoadin". It can send an equipped monster to the Graveyard to prevent its destruction and by sending a "[[Dupe Frog]]" or "[[Poison Draw Frog]]", it is possible to prevent a loss in card advantage, by drawing a card or search/retrieve a "Frog" monster.

  In 2016, with the ''[[Invasion: Vengeance]]'' Booster Pack, the archetype gained its boss monster, "[[Toadally Awesome]]", a very solid Xyz that is able to negate the activation of cards and effects, steal the negated card, Special Summon a "Frog" monster from the Deck and retrieve a WATER monster when it is sent to the Graveyard. Combined with the "[[Paleozoic]]" Trap Cards, that can Summon themselves from the Graveyard as Level 2 Aqua monsters, the Deck rapidily gained popularity and competitive relevance, which later resulted in "Toadally Awesome" becoming [[Limited]] in the OCG.

  "Toadally Awesome" is currently banned in the OCG, because its powerful effects caused Decks based on Level 4 [[WATER]] monsters (which could Summon it throught "[[Bahamut Shark]]") and Level 2 like "[[Spright]]" (which could Summon it with a "Frog" engine) to dominate the metagame.

  ===Weaknesses===
  Cards such as "[[Zombie World]]" can be used to prevent "Toadally Awesome" from being Summoned. Card effects that banish cards that would be sent to the Graveyard, such as "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" and "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", greatly hamper the strategies of "Frog" Decks.
