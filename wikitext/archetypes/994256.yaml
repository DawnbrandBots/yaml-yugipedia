  "'''Armored Xyz'''" (アーマード・エクシーズ ''Āmādo Ekushīzu'') is an [[archetype]] that debuted in ''[[Animation Chronicle 2023]]'' before receiving direct support in ''[[Age of Overlord]]''.

  ==Design==
  The "Xyz Armor" [[Xyz Monster]]s are based on Xyz Monsters used by [[Reginald Kastle|Reginald "Shark" Kastle]] from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'', as Shark was the primary user of the "Armored Xyz" cards. The "[[Full Armor]]ed" Xyz Monsters are also based on monsters used by Shark, but equipped with other specific monsters used by the character, primarily using "[[Black Ray Lancer]]" as either the base Xyz Monster or the monster being equipped to another.
