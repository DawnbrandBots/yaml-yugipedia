  "'''Armored Xyz'''" is an [[archetype]] that debuted in [[Animation Chronicle 2023]] before receiving direct support in ''[[Age of Overlord]]''.

  ==Design==
  The "Xyz Armor" [[Xyz Monster]]s are based on Xyz Monsters used by [[Reginald Kastle]] aka Shark from [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]], as Shark was the primary user of the [[Armored Xyz]] cards. The "[[Full Armor]]ed" Xyz Monsters are also based on monsters used by Shark, but equipped with other specific monsters used by the character, primarily using "[[Black Ray Lancer]]" as either the base Xyz Monster or the monster being equipped to another..

  ==Playing style==
  "Armored Xyz" is a theme centered on the use of the [[Armored Xyz]] [[Spell Card]] and its upgraded [[Trap Card]] equivalent, [[Full Armored Xyz]], to [[Equip|equip]] Xyz Monsters from your [[Graveyard|GY]] to another monster you control and build towards a larger boss monster in the form of "[[Full Armored DARK Lancer]]", which is able to utilize the effects of "Xyz Armor Torpedo" and "Xyz Armor Fortress" while equipped to attack for large damage as well as the effects "DARK Lancer" to gain ATK for each material and equipped card it has as well as the ability to attach an opponent's monster to itself as a material.
