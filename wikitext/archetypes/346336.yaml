  "'''sprout'''" (スプラウト ''Supurauto'') is a small [[archetype]] of [[Level]] 1 [[LIGHT]] [[Plant]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with 100 [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] originally released in ''[[Primal Origin]]''. Both members are part of the "[[Sylvan]]" archetype and thus feature [[Excavate|excavating]] [[Card effect|effects]].

  By using the Level changing effects of "[[Sylvan Princessprout]]", "[[Copy Plant]]" and "[[Spore]]", it is possible to summon most [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] and [[Xyz Monster]]s.
