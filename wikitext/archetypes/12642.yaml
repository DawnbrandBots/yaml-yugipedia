  "'''Neo-Spacian'''" ({{Ruby|Ｎ|ネオスペーシアン}} ''Neosupēshian'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Monster Card|monsters]] related to the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype which focuses on [[Contact Fusion]] with "[[Elemental HERO Neos]]". In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, the "Neo-Spacian" monsters, along with their infant "[[Chrysalis]]" forms, were introduced by [[Jaden Yuki]], who created the concept of these cards when he was a little boy. There are six [[Level]] 3 "Neo-Spacian" monsters, each with a different [[Attribute]] and [[Type]]. This archetype relies on "Elemental HERO Neos" and was designed to give Jaden an alternate strategy to his "Elemental HERO" monsters.

  While the Japanese name of "[[NEX]]" would make it appear to be a member of the archetype, it is not considered a "Neo-Spacian" card due to "different superscripting".<ref>https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/faq_search.action?ope=4&cid=7162&request_locale=ja</ref> Similarly, the "Neo-Spacian" monsters themselves are not to be considered as "[[Neos]]" cards according to a ruling for "[[Elemental HERO Divine Neos]]".

  ==Playing style==
  [[File:Neos Contact in Teardrop.png|250px|left|thumb|The "[[Neos]]" [[Contact Fusion]] monsters.]]

  Unlike most [[Fusion Monster]]s, which must be [[Fusion Summon]]ed, "[[Neos]]" Fusion Monsters are instead Summoned via [[Contact Fusion]], which requires [[shuffling]] the [[Fusion Material]]s on the [[field]] into the [[Deck]] to [[Special Summon]] them. However, the "Neos" Fusion Monsters also have an effect that returns themselves from the field to the [[Extra Deck]] during the [[End Phase]]. To avoid this, the [[Field Spell Card]] "[[Neo Space]]" allows the Fusion Monsters to stay on the field as long as "Neo Space" does, and the [[Equip Spell]] "[[Instant Neo Space]]" allows the [[equip]]ped Fusion Monster to stay on the field (as well as allowing the Special Summon of "[[Elemental HERO Neos]]" when the equipped monster [[leaves the field]]). "[[G.B. Hunter]]", can also prevent the final effect of the "Neos" Fusion Monsters from applying, but will also stop further Contact Fusions.

  The "Neo-Spacian" monsters themselves do not have particularly powerful/useful effects, but there are notable exceptions in the modern game, namely "[[Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin]]" (which can help the player gain information on the opponent's hand, but also potentially get rid of a combo starter or a problematic [[hand trap]] or baiting out the activations of such effects) and "[[Neo-Spacian Grand Mole]]" (which can bounce troublesome monsters by battling them). A couple of them ("Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin" and "[[Neo-Spacian Glow Moss]]") can be [[Card evolutions|upgraded]] with "[[NEX]]" ("[[Neo-Spacian Marine Dolphin]]" and "[[Neo-Spacian Twinkle Moss]]").

  Due to the nature of Contact Fusion, the [[Deck]] must use numerous ways to [[swarm]] the field with "Elemental HERO Neos" and "Neo-Spacian" monsters. "[[Neo Space Connector]]" is essential to this Deck's playstyle as it serves as a one-card "Neos" Contact Fusion; it can Summon "Elemental HERO Neos" or a "Neo-Spacian" monster from the [[hand]] or Deck upon its [[Normal Summon]] and then it can [[Tribute]] itself to Summon another material from the [[GY]]. "Neo-Spacian" monsters are also bolstered by many support cards that range from swarming the field with "[[Cocoon Party]]", "[[Contact]]" or "[[NEXT]]" and "[[Contact Gate]]". Rather than Summoning the [[material]]s onto the field for Contact Fusion, "[[Miracle Contact]]" or "[[Favorite Contact]]" can return materials from the player's hand, field, or GY to the deck (with "Favorite Contact" can also return banished monsters) to Special Summon "Neos" Fusion Monsters, though this does not count as properly Summoning them, so they cannot be Special Summoned again through other cards or effects.

  Most of these effects require filling the GY with "Neo-Spacian" monsters and "Elemental HERO Neos" beforehand. "[[Convert Contact]]" and "[[EN - Engage Neo Space]]" are viable solutions for this, sending two monsters while also gaining two cards. "[[Elemental HERO Prisma]]", which can [[send]] "Elemental HERO Neos" or a "Neo-Spacian" monster to the GY and change its name to the one of the sent card can be used for the Summon of a "Neos" Fusion. Other options include using cards like "[[Wrath of Neos]]" on it. 

  "[[Neos Fusion]]" is a key card which easily Summons a "Neos" Fusion Monster by sending materials from the Deck to the GY, setting up the GY for either reviving materials for Contact Fusions or "Miracle Contact" in subsequent turns (as the card's activation prevents the player from Special Summoning for the rest of that turn). It can then banish itself from the GY to act as a one-time protection for "Neos" Fusion Monsters from destruction, as well as preventing "Neos" Fusion monsters from being shuffled into the Extra Deck by their own effect if "Neo Space" or "Instant Neo Space" is not on the field. A strong choice to Summon with "Neos Fusion" is "[[Elemental HERO Brave Neos]]", which requires a [[Level]] 4 or lower [[Effect Monster]] and "Elemental HERO Neos", which all of the "Neo-Spacian" monsters are. It also allows other Decks to make use of it as "Neos Fusion" functions similarly to "[[Foolish Burial]]" for Level 4 or lower Effect Monsters to make use of their GY effects. Finally, it also does not have an effect to shuffle itself back into the Extra Deck, thereby not needing to waste a copy of "Neos Fusion" from the GY nor requiring "Neo Space" or "Instant Neo Space" to keep it on the field. "Neos Fusion" also allows easy access to "[[Rainbow Neos]]" to make use of its field/GY clearing effects and high [[ATK]]/[[DEF]].

  Although the effects of "Neo Space Connector" are catered towards the Contact Fusion playstyle as mentioned before, it also generated easy access to the effects of "Neos Fusion" by Special Summoning a "Neo-Spacian" monster through its effect, then using that Summoned "Neo-Spacian" monster and itself to [[Link Summon]] "[[Predaplant Verte Anaconda]]", which can then activate its effect by sending "Neos Fusion" to the GY to copy its effect.

  "[[Contact Out]]" acts similarly to "[[De-Fusion]]", allowing the user to replace "Neos" Fusion Monsters for its materials in the Deck to save the Fusion Monster from leaving the field or to gain additional attacks.

  "[[Elemental HERO Spirit of Neos]]" is a key card which can search the vast majority of "Elemental HERO Neos" support cards (or "[[Polymerization]]") upon its Special Summon while also tagging itself out for any normal "Elemental HERO" monster from the deck including "Elemental HERO Neos". It can be Special Summoned from the hand by its own effect during the opponent's turn (which allows itself wall out the opponent's attacks) or "[[Cross Keeper]]", from the Deck with "EN - Engage Neo Space" or "[[EN Shuffle]]". One of the important cards "Spirit of Neos" can search is "[[Instant Contact]]", an "[[Instant Fusion]]"-like card which can cheat out a Level 7 or lower "Elemental HERO" or "Neo-Spacian" monster from the Extra Deck, allowing additional extensions both within and outside of the "Elemental HERO"/"Neo-Spacian" playstyle. 

  As the majority of "Neos" Fusion Monsters list specific materials aside from "Elemental HERO Neos", this allows "Neo-Spacian"/"Neos" Decks to make use of cards like "[[Keeper of Dragon Magic]]" (for searching out the required "Fusion" [[Spell]]s, Summoning needed materials from the GY for Contact Fusions while also being a valid material for "Brave Neos") and "[[Fusion Deployment]]" (which can Summon any needed materials for "Neos" Contact Fusions while also being [[searcha]]ble by "Keeper of Dragon Magic"). Decks that can pump out multiple "[[HERO]]" monsters onto the field, such as the "[[Vision HERO]]" engine of "[[Vision HERO Faris|Faris]]", "[[Vision HERO Increase|Increase]]", and "[[Vision HERO Vyon|Vyon]]", can utilize "[[Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer]]" to search out "Elemental HERO Neos" and/or "Neo-Spacian" monsters.

  As all main deck "Neo-Spacian" monsters are Level 3 and have completely different ATK, Types and Attributes, while only "[[Neo-Spacian Dark Panther]]" and "[[Neo-Spacian Flare Scarab]]" have the same DEF, any Deck playing a heavy amount of "Neo-Spacian" monsters is capable of using "[[Small World]]" to search any of their key monsters, such as "Neo Space Connector" or "Keeper of Dragon Magic".
