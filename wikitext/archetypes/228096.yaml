  "'''Zubaba'''" (ズババ ''Zubaba'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. These cards are used by both [[Yuma Tsukumo]] and [[Astral]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime, [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (manga)|manga]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL|spin-off manga]]. 2 of the 4 of this archetype's non-[[Xyz Monster]]s are [[Level]] 3, while its only Xyz Monster is [[Rank]] 4. 

  ==Playing Style==
  The [[Monster effect|effects]] of the Level 3 Monsters activate during [[battle]]. For example, if "[[Zubaba Knight]]" attacks a [[face-up]] [[Defense Position]] monster, it will be instantly [[destroy]]ed. The effects of the level 4 monsters, “[[Zubababancho Gagagacoat]]” and “[[Utopic Onomatopoeia]]” focus on swarming the field with monsters for [[Xyz Summon]]s. Their Xyz Monster, “[[Zubaba General]]“, equips Warrior Monsters from the hand to itself to power itself up. While attempting to build pure Zubaba deck isn’t recommended due to the archetypes low amount of cards compared to the other “Syllable” themes, a deck based around “Zubaba General“ is more probable, using high ATK monsters, such as “[[Gate Guardian]]” to make it a very strong beater.
