  "'''Monarch'''" ({{Ruby|帝|てい}}{{Ruby|王|おう}} ''Teiō''), also referred to as "'''Emperor'''" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|''Yu-Gi-Oh ARC-V'' manga]], is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s that support [[Tribute Summon]]ed monsters like the "[[Monarch (series)|Monarch]]" [[series]]. It was first introduced in ''[[Cosmo Blazer]]''; after ''[[Shadow Specters]]'' introduced the "Mega Monarchs", these cards' artwork show how the "Monarchs" transformed into the "Mega Monarchs".
  Due to its Japanese name, "[[Emperor of the Land and Sea]]" falls into this archetype. Despite having "Monarch" in their English names, the monsters in the "Monarch" series are not a part of this archetype due to their Japanese names. However, because ''[[TCG]]'' and ''[[OCG]]'' support for this archetype only works on [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s that are not on the field, neither of these cases currently have an impact on gameplay.
  ==Playing style==
  Each has a unique effect that activates on the condition that prevents monsters from being [[Special Summon]]ed from the [[Extra Deck]] or requires that there be no cards in the Extra Deck, although "[[Escalation of the Monarchs]]", "[[Strike of the Monarchs]]" and "[[Tenacity of the Monarchs]]" do not require these conditions to trigger their effects.
  As a draw engine, "[[Tenacity of the Monarchs]]" can search for "[[Pantheism of the Monarchs]]" to dump "[[The Prime Monarch]]", Prime being useful as Tribute or Material for Summon; and does not restrict use of the Extra Deck.  Is repeatable using [[PSY-Framelord Omega]]".
  When combined with the effects of "[[Trade-In]]" and "[[Erebus the Underworld Monarch]]", this draw engine quickly enables a [[Chaos]]-like Graveyard engine capable of recycling powerful Monsters like "[[Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning]]" or "[[Dark Armed Dragon]]".
