  "'''Watt'''", known as "'''Elec'''" (エレキ ''Ereki'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[Thunder]] monsters. It was introduced in ''[[The Shining Darkness]]'', and is used by [[Misaki]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2011: Over the Nexus]]''.
  It was the second Thunder archetype, after "[[Batteryman]]".
  ==Design==
  "[[Wattkid]]", "[[Wattaildragon]]", "[[Wattsychic Fighter]]", and "[[Wattkinetic Puppeteer]]" are part of this archetype, but do not follow the theme of the other members.
  The monsters that are part of the archetype's theme are colorful, electrically-themed animals (Main Deck monsters) or mythical creatures ([[Synchro Monster]]s).
  In Japanese, the themed cards are all based on words that start with ''ki'', forming a [[Wikipedia:Portmanteau|portmanteau]] where the final ''ki'' of the archetype's name ''Eleki'' is also the first character of the animal or creature's name. In the names of several Spell and Trap Cards in this archetype (also in the name of "[[Wattkyuki]]"), the ''ki'' forms part of a [[wikipedia:Digraph (orthography)|digraph]], so it is read as a [[wikipedia:Yōon|yōon]] (''kya'', ''kyu'', or ''kyo'') rather than ''ki''. Due to its highly language-specific nature, this name overlap occurs exclusively in the Japanese names.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Watt" archetype consists of low ATK LIGHT monsters with effects mostly revolving around attacking and the Battle Phase. "Watts" have effects that activate after attacking directly, being destroyed by your opponent's cards, or just simply battling. These secondary effects can restrict the opponent's ability to activate effects, although many other types of effects also exist. The two main strategies of the Deck are: an aggressive Deck relying on the Level 4 "Watts" to inflict damage through direct attacks, or using a lockdown by assembling two face-up copies of "[[Watthopper]]", which prevents the opponent from targeting all "Watt" monsters for attacks and card effects.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Archetypes and monsters like the "[[Ally of Justice]]" monsters benefit from the many LIGHT monsters "Watts" have.
  * [[King Tiger Wanghu]] can shut down a "Watt" deck with its effect to destroy monsters Summoned with 1400 ATK or less. Other than the Synchro "Watt" monsters, "Watt" monsters have less than 1400 ATK, so they will be destroyed by his effect.
  * Since most "Watts" have effects that revolve around the Battle Phase, cards that prevent attacks, like the [[Mirror Trap (series)|Mirror Trap]] series and "[[Battle Fader]]", can easily stop the deck.
  * Cards that negate effects, such as "[[Brain Golem]]" or "[[Skill Drain]]" can leave your "Watt" monsters useless. "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]" hurts any Deck centered around [[LIGHT]] monsters.
  * "[[Spirit Barrier]]" prevents your opponent from taking battle damage while they control a monster. Since "Watt" monsters have low ATK, it can be difficult to deal with.
  * "[[Des Counterblow]]" destroys monsters after they inflict battle damage by attacking directly, so it can destroy some of your key "Watt" monsters.
