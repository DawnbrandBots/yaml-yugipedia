ARC-V]]'' anime, as well as [[Roken Kogami]] and [[Yusaku Fujiki]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]'' anime.

  ===Synchro Monsters===
  ===="Synchron" listed as a Synchro material====
  Some "Synchron" Tuner monsters have a corresponding [[Synchro Monster]], mostly from the "[[Warrior (archetype)|Warrior]]" archetype, that requires it to be used in the [[Synchro Summon]]:
  * "[[Junk Synchron]]": "[[Junk Warrior]]", "[[Junk Gardna]]", "[[Junk Archer]]", "[[Junk Berserker]]" and "[[Junk Destroyer]]"  
  * "[[Nitro Synchron]]": "[[Nitro Warrior]]"
  * "[[Turbo Synchron]]": "[[Turbo Warrior]]"
  * "[[Road Synchron]]": "[[Road Warrior]]"
  * "[[Fleur Synchron]]": "[[Chevalier de Fleur]]"
  * "[[Drill Synchron]]": "[[Drill Warrior]]"
  * "[[Jet Synchron]]": "[[Jet Warrior]]"
  There is also "[[Junk Speeder]]", which requires any "Synchron" Tuner monster for its Synchro Summon, rather than one specific "Synchron" Tuner.
  To get around this limitation, "[[Quickdraw Synchron]]", "[[Junk Anchor]]" and "[[Righty Driver]]" all have an effect that allows them to act as a "[[Synchro Substitute Monster|Substitute]]" to the listed "Synchron" Tuner.
  ===="Synchron" Synchro monsters====
  In addition, there are 2 "Synchron" Synchro Monsters: "[[Formula Synchron]]" and "[[Accel Synchron]]". Both are [[Tuner Synchro Monster]]s, have generic Synchro Materials and have an effect that allows their controller to use them as Synchro Material for a Synchro Summon during their opponent's Main Phase, allowing them to dodge the opponent's card effects, if necessary.

  ===Shooting Quasar Dragon Decklist (December 21, 2017)===
  A Deck that aims to Synchro Summon "[[Shooting Quasar Dragon]]" using "[[Crystron Halqifibrax]]" from "[[LINK VRAINS Pack]]".
  The first effect of "Crystron Halqifibrax" lets you Special Summon a Level 3 or lower Tuner monster from your hand or Deck, allowing you to gather 2 Level 5 Synchro Monsters on the field, while its second effect lets you banish "Halqifibrax" to Special Summon "Formula Synchron" (a [[Tuner Synchro Monster]]) from the Extra Deck during your opponent’s Main Phase or Battle Phase (whilst treating it as a Synchro Summon), assembling the Synchro Materials necessary to Synchro Summon "Shooting Quasar Dragon"

  ===Weaknesses===
  Even with the fact that "Synchrons" are meant to [[swarm]] the field with the utmost haste with the purpose of Synchro Summoning potent, game-changing monsters, there are many "Achilles Heel" weaknesses that can put their stratagem in credible contempt. For instance, "[[And the Band Played On]]", the "[[Vanity's]]" Traps, "[[Reptilianne Servant]]", "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Archlord Kristya]]", "[[Aurora Paragon]]", "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" and other similar anti-Special Summoning cards can heavily debilitate or even shut down "Synchrons" due to their over-reliance on Special Summoning. Similarly, "[[Summon Limit]]" and "[[Summon Breaker]]" can achieve this, with the latter-most being instant karma for over-zealous Summonings.
  "[[Junk Speeder]]" are the main chokepoint of the deck for starting the main plays. As such, it presents a prime target to various negation hand traps, such as "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" or "[[Effect Veiler]]".
  Even if "Synchron"s ''can'' make the field, many other cards can be used to prove that they're nowhere close to being in the clear. The "Synchron"s often subpar [[ATK]]/[[DEF]] and [[Level]] can be capitalized on with "[[King Tiger Wanghu]]", "[[Nanobreaker]]", "[[Deck Devastation Virus]]", "[[Infinite Dismissal]]" and "[[Chain Disappearance]]". "[[Final Attack Orders]]" and "[[All-Out Attacks]]" can also leave them vulnerable to a massive loss of [[Life Points]], especially when combined with the aforementioned "Summon Limit" or even "[[Discord]]". More generally, "[[Torrential Tribute]]" can be used too. Even "[[Core Blast]]" and "[[Pineapple Blast]]" can be [[tech]]ed to even out the field on both sides if "Synchron"-related swarming gets out of hand.
  "[[Necrovalley]]" and "[[The End of Anubis]]" can interdict "Junk Synchron", "Quickdraw Synchron" and "Synchron Explorer" from fetching applicable monsters from the Graveyard, in-effect objectifying their bids for a quick Synchro Summon. Also, cards like the "[[Meklord Emperor|Meklord Emperors]]", "[[Tuner's Scheme]]", "[[Grisaille Prison]]", "[[Orient Dragon]]", "[[Intercept Wave]]" and "[[Shiny Black "C"]]" can instantly stomp on any Synchros that pop out on the field.
  Finally, any "Synchron" Deck that relies on "[[Quickdraw Synchron]]" requires [[discard]]ing a lot of monsters, so if the "Synchron" [[Synchro Monster]] gets [[destroy]]ed, there will be nothing left to protect your [[Life Points]]. To counter this, include cards that can protect "Synchros" or that [[negate]] card-destroying [[Card effect|effects]] like "[[Royal Decree]]", "[[Dark Bribe]]" and "[[Interdimensional Matter Transporter]]" or stop them from being [[banish]]ed with "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]". "[[Macro Cosmos]]" and "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" can also cause problems for "[[Junk Synchron]]", due to minimizing the number of monsters in the Graveyard.
  "[[Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon]]" can also greatly hinder Synchro decks that require summoning two or more monsters at once, such as with "[[Soul Charge]]" to immediately Synchro Summon another "[[Shooting Quasar Dragon]]" and/or "[[Stardust Sifr Divine Dragon]]" after Synchro Summoning the first.

  ==Trivia==
  * "[[Formula Synchron]]" and "[[Accel Synchron]]" are the only "Synchron" [[Synchro Monster]]s.
  * "Performapal Odd-Eyes Synchron" is the only "Synchron" [[Pendulum Monster]].
  * There are currently no [[WATER]] Synchro Monsters that list a "Synchron" monster as [[Synchro Material]], even though there is 1 WATER "Synchron" monster: "[[Steam Synchron]]".
  * All members of this archetype are [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] except for the following:
  ** [[Cyberse]] - "[[Cyberse Synchron]]"
  ** [[Dragon]] - "[[Rokket Synchron]]"
  ** [[Spellcaster]] - "[[Performapal Odd-Eyes Synchron]]"
  ** [[Warrior]] - "[[Junk Synchron]]"
  ** [[Zombie]] - "[[Synchron Keeper]]"
  * "Synchron" is the only protagonist theme to receive a new member from a protagonist (in some cases, antagonist or rival) in another series without such members being a tradition, such as each protagonist having a form of "[[Kuriboh]]" in either the anime or the manga. Synchron has received a new member from Yuya Sakaki in Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V, then later Yusaku Fujiki and Roken Kogami in Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS.
