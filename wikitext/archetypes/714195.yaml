  "'''Bystial'''", known as "'''Byssted'''" (ビーステッド ''Bīsuteddo'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] monsters which first debuted in ''[[Darkwing Blast]]''.

  ==Etymology==
  "Bystial" is a portmanteau of "abyss" and "bestial".

  The Japanese name "Byssted" is a portmanteau of "abyss" and "beast". "Byssted" also uses the kanji 「深淵の獣」, literally meaning "abyss beast". The Japanese names of the [[Special Summon Monster]]s use the same kanji, but they instead read as "The Byssted" (in reference to [[wikipedia:The Beast (Revelation)|the Beast of Revelation]]).

  The [[Level]] 6 "Bystial" Effect Monsters are named after the first kings of Britain according to [[wikipedia:Annio da Viterbo|Annio da Viterbo's]] ''Berossus'' (Viterbo's work was later revealed to be a fabrication and became known as the ''Pseudo-Berossus''). One of the kings in Viterbo's list is the mythological [[wikipedia:Alebion|Albion]], who is said to be the son of [[wikipedia:Poseidon|Poseidon]] and supposedly the namesake of the island of [[wikipedia:Albion|Albion]] (the archaic name of [[wikipedia:Great Britain|Great Britain]]).

  ==Playing style==
  "Bystial" is a Dragon theme centered on banishing resources and general disruption of the opponent's plays. All [[Level]] 6 members of the theme have effects if [[Special Summon]]ed or sent to the [[Graveyard|GY]], and additionally share the following effect:

  {{Quote|''"You can target 1 LIGHT or DARK monster in either GY; banish it, and if you do, Special Summon this card from your hand. This is a Quick Effect if your opponent controls a monster."''}}

  This effect is the crux of the archetype's ability to disrupt your opponent's plays that rely on particular monsters remaining in their Graveyard. Among the Level 6 members, "[[Bystial Magnamhut]]" is the most useful since it can add any Dragon monster from the Deck or GY to the hand, including other "Bystial" monsters. "[[Bystial Druiswurm]]" can send an opponent's Special Summoned monster to the GY if "Druiswurm" is sent to the GY, while "[[Bystial Baldrake]]" can Tribute one other LIGHT or DARK monster the user controls to banish a [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]], [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]], [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]], [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]], or [[Link Monster]] the opponent just Special Summoned, making the duo serve as effective removal options. Finally, "[[Bystial Saronir]]" can send other "Bystial" monsters or "[[Branded]]" [[Spell Card|Spells]]/[[Trap Card|Traps]] to the GY if it is sent to the GY.
   
  Typically in a "Bystial"-focused Deck, the Level 6 "Bystial" monsters also serve as tributes for the higher Level members of the theme, "[[The Bystial Lubellion]]" and "[[The Bystial Alba Los]]". "Lubellion" is a Level 8 monster that can be Special Summoned from hand or GY by tributing 1 Level 6 or higher DARK Dragon monster with effects to not only send itself from hand to GY to search a Level 6 or lower "Bystial" monster but also to place "[[Branded]]" [[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous Spell]]/[[Continuous Trap Card|Trap]] cards from the Deck face-up in your [[Spell & Trap Zone]]. "Alba Los" is the highest leveled monster and requires tributing 2 "Bystial" monsters to Special Summon itself. This card can negate the effects of any face-up [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]], [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]], [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]], [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]], or [[Link Monster|Link]] monster on the field with the additional effect to banish all cards from each player's [[Extra Deck]] face-up if it leaves the field by a card effect. "[[Bystial Dis Pater]]" is a powerful Synchro Monster that can Special Summon any LIGHT or DARK monster that is banished, or it can shuffle one of those monsters to disrupt an opponent if they're using a monster effect.

  "Bystial" monsters generally support and are supported by "Branded" cards, in particular with their Continuous Spells/Traps. The two most useful "Branded" cards are "[[Branded Regained]]" and "[[Branded Beast]]". "Regained" allows the player to recur card advantage, gaining a draw by recovering a LIGHT or DARK monster that was just banished whilst also being able to revive "Bystial" monsters whenever the opponent [[Normal Summon|Normal]] or Special Summons a monster(s). Meanwhile "Beast" can destroy an opponent's card they control by tributing a Dragon monster while the player controls a "Bystial" monster, making it pair well with "Druiswurm" for removing cards on the opponent's field and can recover other "Branded" Continuous Spells/Traps from the GY (typically those sent to the GY with "Bystial Saronir"). Other "Branded" cards include "[[Branded Befallen]]", which can protect the user's "Bystial" monsters from the opponent's interactions by banishing a LIGHT or DARK monster, and "[[Etude of the Branded]]", which allows the user to [[Synchro Summon]] during their opponent's turn and also banishes any monster sent to the opponent's GY if the opponent would use monsters as material for an Extra Deck Summon or Tributes for a [[Ritual Summon]] while the user controls a "Bystial" monster. 

  "Bystial" monsters and their supported "Branded" Spell/Traps fair very well in any deck using LIGHT and/or DARK monsters, especially modern [[Chaos (series)|Chaos]] [[Chaos Dragon|Dragon]] decks. In particular, they synergize most effectively with the "Branded-[[Despia]]" playstyle (the "[[Despia]]" archetype, "[[Fallen of Albaz]]" alongside with their specific supporting cards) due to the large number of cards in the "Branded" archetype as a whole; many of them support the playstyles of both themes.
