  "'''Bystial'''", known as "'''Byssted'''" (ビーステッド ''Bīsuteddo'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] monsters which first debuted in ''[[Darkwing Blast]]''.
  ==Etymology==
  "Bystial" is a portmanteau of "abyss" and "bestial".

  The Japanese name "Byssted" is a portmanteau of "abyss" and "beast". "Byssted" also uses the kanji 「深淵の獣」, literally meaning "abyss beast". The Japanese names of the [[Special Summon Monster]]s use the same kanji, but they instead read as "The Byssted" (in reference to [[wikipedia:The Beast (Revelation)|the Beast of Revelation]]).

  The [[Level]] 6 "Bystial" Effect Monsters are named after the first kings of Britain according to [[wikipedia:Annio da Viterbo|Annio da Viterbo's]] ''Berossus'' (Viterbo's work was later revealed to be a fabrication and became known as the ''Pseudo-Berossus''). One of the kings in Viterbo's list is the mythological [[wikipedia:Alebion|Albion]], who is said to be the son of [[wikipedia:Poseidon|Poseidon]] and supposedly the namesake of the island of [[wikipedia:Albion|Albion]] (the archaic name of [[wikipedia:Great Britain|Great Britain]]).

  ==Playing style==
  "Bystial" is a Dragon theme centered on banishing resources and general disruption of the opponent's plays. All [[Level]] 6 members of the theme have effects if [[Special Summon]]ed or sent to the [[Graveyard|GY]], and additionally share the following effect:

  {{Quote|''"You can target 1 LIGHT or DARK monster in either GY; banish it, and if you do, Special Summon this card from your hand. This is a Quick Effect if your opponent controls a monster."''}}

  This effect is the crux of the archetype's ability to disrupt your opponent's plays that rely on particular monsters remaining in their Graveyard. Typically, in a Bystial-focused Deck the Level 6 "Bystial" monsters will also serve as tributes for the higher Level members of the theme, "[[The Bystial Lubellion]]" and "[[The Bystial Alba Los]]". "Lubellion" is a Level 8 monster that can be Special Summoned from hand or GY by tributing 1 Level 6 or higher DARK Dragon monster with effects to not only send itself from hand to GY to search a "Bystial" monster but also to place "[[Branded]]" [[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous Spell]]/[[Continuous Trap Card|Trap]] cards from the Deck face-up in your [[Spell & Trap Zone]]. "Alba Los" is the highest leveled monster and requires tributing 2 "Bystial" monsters to Special Summon itself. This card can negate the effects of any face-up [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]], [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]], [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]], [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]], or [[Link Monster|Link]] monster on the field with the additional effect to banish all cards from each player's [[Extra Deck]] face-up if it leaves the field by a card effect.
