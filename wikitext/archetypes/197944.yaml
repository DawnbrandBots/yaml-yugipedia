  "'''Atlantean'''", known as  "'''Sea Emperor'''" ({{Ruby|海|かい}}{{Ruby|皇|おう}} ''Kaiō'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Sea Serpent]] monsters. They were first introduced in ''[[Phantom Darkness]]'', with "[[Atlantean Pikeman]]". They later gained more members in ''[[Return of the Duelist]]'', ''[[Realm of the Sea Emperor Structure Deck]]'', which also introduced their first support card, "[[Atlantean Marksman]]", and ''[[Lord of the Tachyon  Galaxy]]'' which introduced "[[Legendary Atlantean Tridon]]".

  == Story ==
  {{See also|[[Gagaga Academy Tospedia card storylines#"The Mermails and Atlanteans" Edition|Gagaga Academy Tospedia card storylines]]}}
  In an attempt to conquer both sea and land of their region, the "Atlanteans", led by their Emperor, "Poseidra", began an attack on the tropical island of the "[[Fire King]]s". However, they resisted the attacks, dragging the war to a standstill. As a way to win their battle, the "Atlanteans" sought the "[[Mermail]]s", who had lost their home. Using the power of their sealed treasure, the [[Abyss-squall|Golden Ring]] that could control the weather, "Poseidra" once again began an attack against the "Fire Kings", but this time, using the military power of the "Mermails".
  They also have a rivalry against the "[[Phantasm Spiral]]" archetype.
  ==Playing Style==
  The "Atlantean" archetype is broadly focused on [[swarm]]ing the field to summon its boss monster, "[[Poseidra, the Atlantean Dragon]]". It is also focused on [[Trigger Effect]]s that activate when an "Atlantean" monster is sent to the GY to activate a WATER monster's effect, i.e. as a [[cost]].

  The four key "Atlantean" monsters are "[[Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince]]", "[[Atlantean Heavy Infantry]]", "[[Atlantean Marksman]]", and "[[Atlantean Dragoons]]". Each has two effects, with the second being a [[Trigger Effect]] that shares the condition: ''"If/When this card is sent to the Graveyard to activate a WATER monster's effect: [Effect]"''

  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Atlantean !! Triggered Effect
  |-
  | [[Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince|Neptabyss]]
  | Revive 1 other "Atlantean" monster.
  |-
  | [[Atlantean Heavy Infantry|Heavy Infantry]]
  | Destroy 1 enemy face-up card.
  |- 
  | [[Atlantean Marksman|Marksman]]
  | Destroy 1 enemy Set card.
  |-
  | [[Atlantean Dragoons|Dragoons]]
  | Search 1 other Sea Serpent monster.
  |-
  |}

  Any WATER monster effect [[cost]] that can send an "Atlantean" to the GY can trigger its Trigger Effect. These include:
  * Discarded or sent from the hand to the GY (e.g.: Level 7 "[[Mermail]]" monsters, "[[Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]")
  * Tributed (e.g.: Level 7 "[[Mermail]]" monsters, "[[Poseidra, the Atlantean Dragon]]")
  * Sent from the Deck to the GY (e.g.: "[[Genex Undine]]", "[[Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince]]", "[[Deep Sea]]" monsters)
  * Detached from an Xyz Monster as a material (e.g. "[[Bahamut Shark]]")

  In addition to having a Trigger Effect, "[[Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince]]" is also an in-archetype "activator" with a cost that can send an "Atlantean" to the GY: by sending 1 "Atlantean" monster from the Deck to the GY as a cost, "Neptabyss" can search 1 "Atlantean" card. This makes it the Deck's key starter and searcher.

  As a pure Deck, the archetype's game plan ends with summoning its boss monster, "[[Poseidra, the Atlantean Dragon]]", which has become obsolete as the game's power level increased. Instead, the archetype was historically more commonly used as an advantage engine supplementing the "[[Mermail]]" archetype, which it has great synergies with. Because many "Mermail" effects discard a WATER monster as cost, the "Atlantean" trigger effects can be used to offset these costs, providing further card advantage for more combos.
