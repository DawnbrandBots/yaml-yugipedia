  "'''Atlantean'''", known as  "'''Sea Emperor'''" ({{Ruby|海|かい}}{{Ruby|皇|おう}} ''Kaiō'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Sea Serpent]] monsters. They were first introduced in ''[[Phantom Darkness]]'', with "[[Atlantean Pikeman]]". They later gained more members in ''[[Return of the Duelist]]'', ''[[Realm of the Sea Emperor Structure Deck]]'', which also introduced their first support card, "[[Atlantean Marksman]]", and ''[[Lord of the Tachyon  Galaxy]]'' which introduced "[[Legendary Atlantean Tridon]]".

  == Story ==
  {{See also|[[Gagaga Academy Tospedia card storylines#"The Mermails and Atlanteans" Edition|Gagaga Academy Tospedia card storylines]]}}
  In an attempt to conquer both sea and land of their region, the "Atlanteans", led by their Emperor, "Poseidra", began an attack on the tropical island of the "[[Fire King]]s". However, they resisted the attacks, dragging the war to a standstill. As a way to win their battle, the "Atlanteans" sought the "[[Mermail]]s", who had lost their home. Using the power of their sealed treasure, the [[Abyss-squall|Golden Ring]] that could control the weather, "Poseidra" once again began an attack against the "Fire Kings", but this time, using the military power of the "Mermails".
  They also have a rivalry against the "[[Phantasm Spiral]]" archetype.
  ==Playing Style==
  The "Atlantean" archetype focuses on swarming the field with low-Level WATER monsters, and triggering beneficial effects by being sent to the GY to activate a WATER monster's effect. Though the archetype can be played with its "intended" playstyle focusing on the archetypal boss monster "[[Poseidra, the Atlantean Dragon]]", the archetype was historically far more commonly used as a combo engine to supplement the "[[Mermail]]" archetype, forgoing "Poseidra" due to its ineffectiveness.
  The four key "Atlantean" monsters are "[[Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince]]", "[[Atlantean Heavy Infantry]]", "[[Atlantean Marksman]]", and "[[Atlantean Dragoons]]". Each of the four have two effects, with the second effect being a [[Trigger Effect]] that shares the condition: ''"If/When this card is sent to the Graveyard to activate a WATER monster's effect: [Effect]"''
  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Atlantean !! Triggered Effect

  | [[Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince]]
  | Target 1 "Atlantean" monster in your Graveyard, except "Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince"; Special Summon it.

  |-
  | [[Atlantean Dragoons|Dragoons]]
  | Add 1 Sea Serpent monster from your Deck to your hand, except "Atlantean Dragoons".
  |-
  |}
  There are many WATER monsters in the game with costs that can Trigger the "Atlantean" monsters' Trigger Effects. Some notable examples of effect [[cost]]s that can trigger "Atlantean" effects include:
  * Discarded or sent from the hand to the GY, such as by the Level 7 "[[Mermail]]" monsters, "[[Abyss Soldier]]", or "[[Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]" and "[[Gungnir, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]"
  * Tributed, such as by the Level 7 "[[Mermail]]" monsters
  * Sent from the Deck to the GY, such as by "[[Genex Undine]]", "[[Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince]]", or the "[[Deep Sea]]" monsters. 
  * Detached from an Xyz Monster as a material to activate its effect, such as by "[[Bahamut Shark]]"
  In addition to having a Trigger Effect, "[[Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince]]" additionally has an on-field activated effect that makes it the key starter for the Deck: it can send 1 "Atlantean" monster from the Deck to the Graveyard to add 1 "Atlantean" card from the Deck to the hand. This both triggers an "Atlantean" monster's effect and searches out another "Atlantean" card, allowing for a rapid accumulation of resources. Due to its importance, "Atlantean" decks commonly play "[[Deep Sea Diva]]" to Special Summon "Neptabyss" directly from the Deck.
  The archetypal [[Spell Card]], "[[Call of the Atlanteans]]", is a [[Quick-Play Spell Card]] that Special Summon 3 Level 3 or lower Sea Serpent monsters from the Graveyard, but prohibits Special Summoning anything else in the turn it is activated. Being a Quick-Play, it can be activated in the opponent's turn to avoid its negative restriction and be used to recover large amounts of resources from the GY.
  The archetype synergizes especially well with "[[Mermail]]" archetype, since most of the "Mermails" effects involve discarding a water monster as a cost, which will in turn activate the "Atlantean's" effects. By using "[[Mermail Abysspike]]," "[[Mermail Abyssturge]]" and/or "[[Mermail Abyssmegalo]]" with the "Atlanteans" you will be able to activate their useful effects and the "Atlanteans" effects together.
