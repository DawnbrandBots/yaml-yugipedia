  "'''Kashtira'''", known as "'''Kshatrira'''" (クシャトリラ ''Kushatorira'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of primarily [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 7 [[Psychic]] monsters introduced in ''[[Darkwing Blast]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 02: The New Broken Worlds}}

  ==Etymology==
  "Kshatrira" appears to be a portmanteau of [[wikipedia:Kshatriya|Kshatriya]] and ''ira'' (Latin for "anger"). The 3 Main Deck members introduced in "Darkwing Blast" are named after mythological creatures. Their names combine to form "UFO" ('''U'''nicorn, '''F'''enrir, and '''O'''gre).

  ==Design==
  All members (and their structures, as depicted in "[[Kashtira Birth]]") were depicted in a futuristic dystopian style. Each "Kashtira" monsters have a primarily red and black color scheme, with purple accents on the Main Deck monsters. Each "Kashtira" monsters were depicted as a bio-mechanical beings with several parts of their body either grafted or replaced with cybernetic parts.

  The exception of these design are "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]" who has a similar "galactic arm" as "[[Visas Starfrost]]", and "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]", which is essentially "[[Pressured Planet Wraitsoth]]" (the home world of "Kashtira" monsters) summoned as a monster itself.

  Their own art as well as related Spells and Traps depict them as alien invaders onto "[[Primitive Planet Reichphobia]]" and later "[[Primeval Planet Perlereino]]", taking resources and abducting their inhabitants away in canisters (manifested in gameplay as banishing face-down).

  ==Playing style==
  "Kashtira" is an archetype focused around primarily [[Level]] 7 [[Psychic]] monsters and [[Banish|banishing]] cards face-down. Most members of the archetype, excluding "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]", are Level 7 monsters able to [[Special Summon]] themselves if the player controls no monsters or by some other condition, such as with "[[Scareclaw Kashtira]]" and "[[Tearlaments Kashtira]]", are able to search cards while on the field, and can banish their opponent's cards (from various different locations) if they attack or if the opponent activates a monster effect.

  The "U.F.O" Level 7 "Kashtira" monsters ("[[Kashtira Unicorn]]", "[[Kashtira Fenrir]]", and "[[Kashtira Ogre]]") are the key playmakers of the deck. Each of the "U.F.O" trio can be Special summoned if you have no monsters on your field, each has an effect to search "Kashtira" monster, spell, or trap card, and each has an effect to banish opponent's card face-down from various places whenever they attacks or when any of the opponent's monster activate their effects.

  |[[Kashtira Unicorn|Unicorn]]
  |"Kashtira" [[Spell card]]
  |1 card from opponent's [[Extra Deck]].
  |Can search either "[[Kashtiratheosis]]" to summon another "Kashtira" monster for more search effects, or "[[Kashtira Birth]]" to utilize other "Kashtira" monster on your hand or that is [[Banish|banished]]. Its banish effect is useful for eliminating potentially dangerous card from opponent's [[Extra Deck]].
  |-
  | [[Kashtira Fenrir|Fenrir]]
  |"Kashtira" [[Monster card]]
  |1 [[Face-up|face-up]] card on the opponent's [[Field]].
  |Can search "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]", which can be immediately special summoned by its own effect and activate its Level change effect. Its banish effect can be used as a form of removal when going second or as an interruption during opponent's turn.
  |-
  | [[Kashtira Ogre|Ogre]]
  |"Kashtira" [[Trap card]]
  |1 of up to 5 card(s) [[Excavate|excavated]] from the opponent's top [[Deck]].
  |Can search either "[[Kashtira Preparations]]" to set up grind game, or "[[Kashtira Big Bang]]" as a removal option. Its banish effect allows the player to foresee any card that opponent might draw in the next turn (provided that opponent doesn't use any effect that has them [[Shuffle|shuffling]] their deck before their [[Draw Phase]]) and eliminate the one that might counter your game plans.
  |}

  This banish playstyle is further emphasized through their original boss monster "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]", a Rank 7 [[Xyz Monster]] with 0 ATK able to Special Summon more Kashtira monsters to the field and lockdown unused [[Main Monster Zone]]s as well as [[Spell & Trap Zone]]s each time an opponent's card in their possession is banished face-down.

  This Playing style would be further enhanced through the introduction of "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]", a Level 4 [[FIRE]] [[Warrior]] monster able to banish a "Kashtira" card from your Deck to banish the top 3 cards of the opponent's Deck, face-down, and become Level 7 itself for use in [[Xyz Summon]]s. Their new offensive force is the Rank 7 "[[Kashtira Arise-Heart]]", a 3000 ATK monster able to be quickly Xyz Summoned once per turn using any 1 "Kashtira" monster on the field the same turn that "Shangri-Ira" used its effect and able to force any cards send to the GY to be banished instead as well as granting itself more materials to use 3 materials and banish any card on the field, face-down.

  "Kashtira" Spell/Trap cards focus on summoning additional "Kashtira" monsters, and either banishing opponents' cards if the opponent activates a card of the same type, or activating an effect when they're banished themselves.

  While "Kashtira" decks were usually played as a lockdown deck to prevent opponent from summoning any monsters and/or using any Spell/Trap cards, the ability to quickly summon various Level 7 monsters usually without [[Normal Summon]] also allows the deck to either form the core of the "7-Axis" strategy to exploit various generic Rank 7 monsters, or to further utilize various [[Tuner monster]] [[Hand trap|hand traps]] such as "[[Effect Veiler]]" or the [[Yo-kai Girl]] series to summon Level 8 or 10 [[Synchro Monster]]s.

  Also, due to the aforementioned non-reliance on Normal Summon, "Kashtira" decks also synergize well with the [[Adventurer Token (series)|Adventurer Token]] series, as "Kashtira" monsters can easily trigger the basic search effects of "[[Fateful Adventure]]". In addition, the two key interruption of the series, "[[Wandering Gryphon Rider]]" and "[[Illegal Knight]]" is a Level 7 monsters that can be either special summoned first by their own effects (that can be chained together to summon both at once) as a generic starter, as an additional extender/interruption while "[[Adventurer Token]]" were on the field, or as an extra materials summoned through the effect of "Kashtira Birth".

  ===Weakness===
  * "Kashtira" deck relies heavily on [[Banish|banishing]] cards to make their plays. Because of this, anti-banish floodgate such as "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" and "[[Chaos Hunter]]" can disable most of the main plays. "Chaos Hunter" in particular is especially dangerous in a [[Mirror Match]] due to its floodgate effect are one-sided and can also be easily summoned by the opponent's "Kashtira" cards.
  * As the "Kashtira" deck can special summon multiple times per turn "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" is a great threat to the deck, as it can remove all of the "Kashtira" monsters on the field, since none of them has protection against "Nibiru"'s effect. Conversely, cards that prevent special summoning, such as "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" can also shut down any "Kashtira" game plans.
  * In a delicated zone lock strategy, any non-destruction removal effect or cards that can force the opponent's monster [[Face-down|face-down]], such as that of "[[Book of Moon]]" or "[[Compulsory Evacuation Device]]" can easily take care of "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]". Similarly, "[[Kaiju]]" and similar monsters can also remove "Shangri-Ira" from the field and bypass its protection effect.
  * In the "pure" version of the deck, "Kashtira" monsters requires either having no monsters on your field (in the case of the three main Level 7 monsters) or already having "Kashtira" monster on the field (in the case of "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]"), cards that can be summoned onto the opponent's field before they could summon any "Kashtira" monsters, such as "[[Mushroom Man 2]]", can prevent them from summoning anything unless player already have "[[Kashtira Birth]]" on the hand.
  * Since the deck consists of monsters of multiple [[Attribute]]s, "[[Gozen Match]]" can also shut down a "Kashtira" deck from summoning more monsters.
