  "'''T.G.'''", short for "'''Tech Genus'''" ({{Ruby|ＴＧ|テックジーナス}} ''Tekku Jīnasu''), is an [[archetype]] used by [[Bruno|Antinomy]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]''. They are all [[wikipedia:Cyborg|bionic]] in appearance to reference the identity of their user. They made their debut in ''[[Extreme Victory]]''.
  ==Design==
  [[File:T.G..png|200px|left|thumb|[[Bruno]] with "[[T.G. Wonder Magician (anime)|T.G. Wonder Magician]]" and "[[T.G. Hyper Librarian (anime)|T.G. Hyper Librarian]]" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's|anime]].]]
  In the Japanese anime, each of them has a code in their name which references their [[Type]], followed by a number. This includes their status as they have X's at the end of their names to indicate their evolution of Synchro Monsters:
  * [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] - X
  * [[Accel Synchro Monster|Accel Synchro]] - XX
  * [[Delta Accel Synchro Monster|Delta Accel Synchro]] - XXX
  They are high tech [[Monster Card|monsters]] from the future and they share a variation of this [[Card effect|effect]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's|anime]]:
  ''This card can also be treated as a [[Machine]]-Type monster. When a [[Spell Card|Spell]] or [[Trap Card]] you [[control]] [[target]]s this card, you can halve this card's [[original ATK and DEF]]. When this card is [[destroy]]ed, you can add 1 "T.G." monster card from your [[Main Deck|Deck]] to your [[hand]]. You cannot [[Summon]] it this [[turn]].''
  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 5]]'', it is possible to use the card obtained during the same turn, and the [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] reduction is not present among their effects.
  The real life version of the "T.G." cards consist of monsters who can "replace" themselves with different monsters when they're destroyed. Most of the non-Synchro Monsters search for other "T.G." monsters besides ones that share their name (for example, a "[[T.G. Warwolf]]" can search for any "T.G." monster besides "T.G. Warwolf"), while all of the Synchro Monsters (except "[[T.G. Blade Blaster]]") [[Draw a card|draw]] cards or Summon monsters.
  Despite their bionic appearance and names, the only existing [[Machine]] "T.G." monsters are [[Accel Synchro Monster|Accel Synchro]] and [[Link Monster]]s. Of note, no members that reside in the Main Deck share the same Type either, except for "[[T.G. Gear Zombie|Gear Zombie]]" and "[[T.G. Metal Skeleton|Metal Skeleton]]". All "T.G." supporting Spell and Trap Cards have an initialism in their names.
  ==Playing style==
  The goal of the archetype is to [[Accel Synchro Summon]] "T.G." monsters to control the field. "T.G. Blade Blaster" can [[negate]] [[Spell Card|Spells]] and [[Trap Card|Traps]] while "[[T.G. Halberd Cannon]]" can negate Summons. Due to the ease of low-Level [[Synchro Summon]]s, Summoning the two aforementioned monsters is a matter of summoning and protecting the [[Synchro Material Monster]]s. A good rival of "T.G. Halberd Cannon" is "[[Shooting Quasar Dragon]]" due to the high attack stats and powerful effects. Although "Quasar" is preferred due to the multiple attacking ability. One could also Synchro Summon "[[Cosmic Blazar Dragon]]" or "[[Stardust Sifr Divine Dragon]]" instead for more control of your opponent or protection, respectively.
  "[[T.G. Striker]]", "[[T.G. Warwolf]]", and "[[T.G. Booster Raptor]]" are the best cards to swarm with. At the very least, in case you cannot Synchro Summon, you can build a defense and let your opponent [[destroy]] them, giving you plenty of cards to add to your hand at the [[End Phase]].
  Because of the extensive use of Level 5 Synchro Monsters, a T.G. Deck can easily summon powerful monsters outside the archetype, such as "[[Hi-Speedroid Chanbara]]", "[[Armades, Keeper of Boundaries]]", and in some cases [[Naturia Beast]].

  ===Weaknesses===
  Since this archetype is one of the most Synchro-focused archetypes, rivaling [[Yusei]]-themed and [[Inca]] Decks, all [[List of Anti-Synchro Monster Support Cards|anti-Synchro]] support can kill the Deck, in addition to all the typical [[Anti-Meta]] strategies that most Decks fall prey to. "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" can prevent you from Synchro Summoning for a turn. "[[Soul Drain]]" completely turns off almost all of your "T.G." monsters, preventing you from activating your Graveyard effects to draw, Special Summon, or search. None of the non-Synchro Monsters provide any offensive capabilities, barring "[[T.G. Rush Rhino|Rush Rhino]]" with "[[TGX300]]" on the field. "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" and "[[Mistake]]" can also stop their searching. Use "[[TG1-EM1]]" or "[[Creature Swap]]" to take control of your opponent's monster when you don't have strong attack power. Also, nearly all monsters have effects that ease the Synchro Summons while wreaking havoc on the player's hand. Therefore, field clearing becomes even more important so protect your monsters (especially "T.G. Hyper Librarian" with "[[Starlight Road]]" or "[[My Body as a Shield]]". You can also run multiple copies of "[[TGX3-DX2]]", due to the rate at which the T.G. monsters are Summoned, and - consequently - sent to the Graveyard to replenish your hand and recycle your T.G. monsters. 
  Additionally, the "T.G." archetype is extremely weak to many common Side-Deck cards, such as "[[Gozen Match]]", "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]", and "[[Mistake]]". "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]" deserves a special mention, because it completely shuts down the deck, due to the T.G. monsters consisting of entirely different Types. Because of this, one should build their Main/Side deck with these threats in mind. "[[TGX1-HL]]" is a great card that T.G.'s have at their disposal, which is functionally the same as "Mystical Space Typhoon", should one need additional Spell/Trap removal.
