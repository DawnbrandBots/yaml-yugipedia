  "'''T.G.'''", short for "'''Tech Genus'''" ({{Ruby|ＴＧ|テックジーナス}} ''Tekku Jīnasu''), is an [[archetype]] used by [[Bruno|Antinomy]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' and made their debut in ''[[Extreme Victory]]''

  ==Design==
  <div style="float: right;">[[File:T.G..png|200px|right|thumb|[[Bruno]] with "[[T.G. Wonder Magician (anime)|T.G. Wonder Magician]]" and "[[T.G. Hyper Librarian (anime)|T.G. Hyper Librarian]]" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's|anime]].]]</div>
  Appearance-wise, most T.G. monsters are various [[wikipedia:Cyborg|cybernetic]] lifeforms, animals primarily, infused with machines to create bio-organic lifeforms. This is enforced through the shared trait of their anime equivalents as all T.G. monsters shared the unique effect to also be treated as [[Machine]] monsters, a trait that would be later referenced through the Spell Card "[[T.G. All Clear]]".

  In the Japanese 5Ds anime, the T.G. monsters had additional codes in their names that referenced their primary [[Type]] followed by a number. For example, "[[T.G. Striker]]" in the 5Ds anime was listed as "Tech Genus Striker WA-01" in which the "WA" referred to it being a [[Warrior]] monster. This naming convention is further explored with the theme's [[Synchro Monster]]s through the inclusion of a "X" at the end of their type status and the increase to the number used at the end of the serial code that evolves further with each stage of Synchro Monster reached, reaching numbers of 1000, 10000, and ∞. The only outliers to this being "[[T.G. Hyper Librarian]]" and "[[T.G. Recipro Dragonfly]]", which have the codes of "1100" and "00" respectively
  * [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] - X-1000
  * [[Accel Synchro Monster|Accel Synchro]] - XX-10000
  * [[Delta Accel Synchro Monster|Delta Accel Synchro]] - XXX-∞

  In addition to this, all "T.G." supporting Spell and Trap Cards from the initial wave have an initialism in their names that represents their intended functions.

  ==Playing style==
  The primary playing style of "T.G." is to [[Special Summon]] as many T.G. monsters to the field as quickly as possible in order to rapidly [[Synchro Summon]] "T.G." Synchro Monsters and create even stronger monsters through "[[Accel Synchro Summon|Accel Synchro Summoning]]". The theme achieves this through the effects of various "T.G." monsters to Special Summon themselves as well as other monsters to the field; two important members of this in more recent times being the [[Link Monster]] "[[T.G. Trident Launcher]]", which is able to summon 3 "T.G." monsters to its zones (1 each from the hand, Deck, and GY), and the Level 5 Synchro Monster "[[T.G. Over Dragonar]]", which Special Summons any number of "T.G." monsters from the GY. The other trait carried by several T.G. monsters is the ability to add any 1 "T.G." monster from the Deck to the hand at the [[End Phase]] of the turn if they were destroyed on the field, setting up plays for the next turn.

  The theme is further enhance through the versatility of options the Deck is able to run in order to add its monsters to the hand, even beyond the effects of the monsters at the End Phase. Due to the various combinations of Type and [[Level]] as well as their inherit effects to summon themselves, T.G. is able to run many different [[Searcher]] Spell Cards from "[[Reinforcement of the Army]]" for "[[T.G. Striker]]" to "[[Fossil Dig]]" and "[[Miscellaneousaurus]]" for "[[T.G. Booster Raptor]]" to even the Spell Card "Bonfire" for one of their most recent monsters; "[[T.G. Rocket Salamander]]". Due to this, there are many different ways to build "T.G." in order to fuel their goal of quickly Summoning their archetypal boss monsters as well as many other powerful Level 12 Synchro Monsters.

  ===Weaknesses===
  Since this archetype is one of the most Synchro-focused archetypes, rivaling [[Yusei]]-themed and [[Inca]] Decks, all [[List of Anti-Synchro Monster Support Cards|anti-Synchro]] support can kill the Deck, in addition to all the typical [[Anti-Meta]] strategies that most Decks fall prey to. "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" can prevent you from Synchro Summoning for a turn. "[[Soul Drain]]" completely turns off almost all of your "T.G." monsters, preventing you from activating your Graveyard effects to draw, Special Summon, or search. None of the non-Synchro Monsters provide any offensive capabilities, barring "[[T.G. Rush Rhino|Rush Rhino]]" with "[[TGX300]]" on the field. "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" and "[[Mistake]]" can also stop their searching. Use "[[TG1-EM1]]" or "[[Creature Swap]]" to take control of your opponent's monster when you don't have strong attack power. Also, nearly all monsters have effects that ease the Synchro Summons while wreaking havoc on the player's hand. Therefore, field clearing becomes even more important so protect your monsters (especially "T.G. Hyper Librarian" with "[[Starlight Road]]" or "[[My Body as a Shield]]". You can also run multiple copies of "[[TGX3-DX2]]", due to the rate at which the T.G. monsters are Summoned, and - consequently - sent to the Graveyard to replenish your hand and recycle your T.G. monsters. 
  Additionally, the "T.G." archetype is extremely weak to many common Side-Deck cards, such as "[[Gozen Match]]", "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]", and "[[Mistake]]". "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]" deserves a special mention, because it completely shuts down the deck, due to the T.G. monsters consisting of entirely different Types. Because of this, one should build their Main/Side deck with these threats in mind. "[[TGX1-HL]]" is a great card that T.G.'s have at their disposal, which is functionally the same as "Mystical Space Typhoon", should one need additional Spell/Trap removal.
