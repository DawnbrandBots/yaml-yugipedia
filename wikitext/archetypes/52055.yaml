  "'''Darklord'''", known as "'''Fallen Angel'''" ({{Ruby|堕|だ}}{{Ruby|天|てん}}{{Ruby|使|し}} ''Datenshi'') in the Japanese version, is an [[archetype]] comprised primarily of [[DARK]] [[Fairy]] [[Effect Monster|Effect]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They are used by [[Midori Hibiki]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX manga|''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' manga]], and by [[Anna Des]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures]]''. Many of their effects are focused on sending "Darklord" monsters to the [[Graveyard]] and then [[Special Summon]]ing them. Much of this [[archetype]] have been released as ''[[V Jump promotional cards]]''.

  Though members of the archetype have existed since 2001, the archetype had no support until the release of ''[[Booster SP: Destiny Soldiers]]'' in the ''OCG'' and ''[[Destiny Soldiers]]'' in the ''TCG'', both in 2016. In the ''TCG'', "[[Darklord Marie]]" and "[[Darklord Nurse Reficule]]" were also renamed to their current names in the same set, to clearly mark their status as "Darklord" cards.

  ==Members==
  Nearly all members of this archetype (except for three; see below) are based on figures or concepts from Judeo-Christian and Abrahamic theology, and are the contrasting DARK and Fairy types to represent their status as fallen angels.

  Three particular Darklord monsters are not based on theological figures, but instead based on characters featured in the artworks of various "[[Forbidden (archetype)|Forbidden]]" and "[[Solemn]]" cards.

  ==Playing style==
  A "Darklord" Deck focuses on [[send]]ing its cards to the Graveyard and then reviving their monsters, especially "[[Darklord Superbia]]" who then in turn can also revive another Fariy monster. Sending "Darklord" cards to the Graveyard can be done with monster effects such as those of "[[Condemned Darklord]]", "[[Darklord Ixchel]]", "[[Darklord Nasten]]" and "[[Darklord Ukoback]]". All cards in the archetype can be [[searcher|searched]] with "[[Banishment of the Darklords]]", "Condemned Darklord" or "[[Indulged Darklord]]" (though the latter two can only search monsters). Bringing back "Darklord" monsters requires a more permanent solution rather than relying on one-time use cards such as "[[Monster Reborn]]", "[[Call of the Haunted]]" or "[[Ribbon of Rebirth]]" but within the archetype, "[[Darklord Contact]]", "[[Darklord Descent]]" and "[[The First Darklord]]" are viable choices.

  With the exception of "[[Darklord Morningstar]]", all of the Level 6 and higher Main Deck "Darklord" monsters from ''[[Destiny Soldiers]]'' and onwards share the following [[condition]]s and effect:

  #"''You can only Special Summon "CARD NAME(s)" once per turn.''" 
  #"''(Quick Effect): You can pay 1000 [[LP]], then target 1 "Darklord" [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card|Trap]] in your GY; this effect becomes that target's effect when that card is activated, then shuffle that target into the [[Deck]]. You can only use this/each effect of "CARD NAME" once per turn.''"

  Although Special Summoning from the Graveyard is a major theme of "Darklord", a swarm play-style is unsuitable, due to many of the archetype's newer Main Deck members being limited by this shared condition. This, as well as the variety of [[Level]]s "Darklord" monsters have, makes it difficult to [[Xyz Summon]] with this archetype (except for Rank 8). On the other hand, their shared Quick Effect allows even a single copy of a "Darklord" Spell/Trap to be potentially "used" twice even on the same turn (despite their [[only once per turn]] card activation limitations) or during the opponent's turn whilst recycling them into the Deck. The applications of this effect include an additional search with "Banishment of the Darklords", an additional revival with "Darklord Contact" or "Darklord Descent" and using the other Trap effects to disrupt the opponent's plays which can be done more quickly and easily with the "Darklord" monsters' Quick Effects rather than activating the Trap Cards normally (which all of them except "Darklord Descent" share the card activation cost of sending a "Darklord" monster from the user's hand or field, causing the player to lose hand/field advantage while "Darklord Descent" requires half of the player's LP to be activated). This gives the "Darklord" Traps better utility of being used as discard costs for the effects of other cards. The effects of "Condemned Darklord", "[[Darklord Uprising]]" (through activating the card itself) and "[[The Sanctified Darklord]]" can increase LP that is needed to keep using the "Darklord" monsters' Quick Effects (including "The First Darklord").

  This deck, due to the large accumulation of DARK monsters, can also run DARK monster Deck support cards such as "[[Dark Illusion]]", "[[Allure of Darkness]]", "[[Armageddon Knight]]" or "[[Dark Grepher]]". Due to the Deck being able to regulate the number of "Darklord" monsters in the Graveyard (or rather, DARK/Fairy monsters in general), "[[Archlord Kristya]]" and "[[Dark Armed Dragon]]" can also be used. Additionally, "[[Trade-In]]" can be used due to a number of Level 8 monsters present in the deck. 

  While "Darklord" card effects make them suitable for supporting Fairy monsters in general, they can pair well with "[[Branded]]-[[Despia]]" since all Main Deck "Despia" monsters are DARK Fairy monsters, making them elligible Fusion Materials for "The First Darklord"; furthermore, "The First Darklord" can be more easily Fusion Summoned with the effects of various "Branded" cards (ie. "[[Despia, Theater of the Branded]]" or "[[Branded in Red]]") which are searchable with "[[Aluber the Jester of Despia]]" rather than relying on just "Darklord Uprising". In return, the "Darklord" monsters are also elligible Fusion Materials for the "Despia" Fusion Monsters and their related support (including the [[Albaz Dragon]]s if "[[Fallen of Albaz]]" is used and given that most of those monsters are DARK, they can also be Fusion Summoned with "Darklord Uprising").
