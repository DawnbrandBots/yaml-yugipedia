  "'''Evolzar'''", known as "'''Evolkaiser'''" (エヴォルカイザー ''Evorukaizā'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an "[[Evol]]" sub-[[archetype]] consisting of [[FIRE]] [[Dragon]] [[Xyz Monster]]s. "Evolzar" monsters are the final stage of [[wikipedia:evolution|evolution]], being evolved from [[Dinosaur]] "[[Evolsaur]]" monsters. They are [[Xyz Summon]]ed with only 2 Dinosaur monsters.

  ==Playing style==

  These 3 monsters focus on the disruption of your opponents card effects (such as "[[Evolzar Dolkka]]" being able to negate the activation and destroy it), or Special Summons  (such as "[[Evolzar Solda]]" being able to destroy any Special Summon) and negating [[Spell]] and [[Trap]]s (such as "[[Evolzar Laggia]]" being able to negate the activation of a Spell/Trap and destroy it. Except for [[Counter Trap]]s) and controlling the field with these effects.

  == Trivia ==
  * All "Evolzar" monsters are surrounded by fire, but apparently, cards, like "Evolzar Laggia" and "Evolzar Solda", have a fire ring surrounding them while cards, such as "Evolzar Dolkka", has a fiery shower.
  * All "Evolzar" monsters have a symbol below their waist similar to a beehive (with the exception of "Evolzar Laggia", where the symbol is on its waist).
  * The "Evolzar" are the first sub-archetype supporting [[Dinosaur]] monsters.
  * Their tails resemble more-advanced strands of DNA than "[[Evoltile]]s" and "[[Evolsaur]]s".
  * Their English name is a combination of ''evol''ution and C''zar'', alternative for [[wikipedia:Caesar (title)|Caesar]]. Caesar being a general term for emperors, and [[wikipedia:Tsar|Czar]] referring to a controlling position; both terms refer to the effects of these Xyz Monsters.
  * Their background of their pictures are the same as "Evoltiles" and "Evolsaurs" except:
  ** "Evolzars" have binary in the background as opposed to "Evoltiles" ancient language and "Evolsaurs" modern Latin alphabet language.
  ** "Evolzars" may or may not have the molecule in the background. If it's there, it's is obscured as all current "Evolzars" are rather large.
  * The Summoning requirements using Dinosaurs for "Evolzar" monsters is similar to, yet easier than, other Dragons (whether by name or type) that include Dinosaurs in their Summoning, including "[[Water Dragon]]" (though it's a [[Sea Serpent]]), which uses "[[Bonding - H2O]]" to Tribute 2 "[[Hydrogeddon]]s" and an "[[Oxygeddon]]", which are Dinosaurs, to Summon it, or in "[[Hyozanryu]]'s" case, using another Dinosaur, "[[Carboneddon]]", by banishing the latter from the Graveyard to Summon "Hyozanryu".
  * These three cards are the only [[Dragon]] monsters to support Dinosaur monsters.
