  "'''Fur Hire'''", known as "'''Skyfang Brigade'''" ({{Ruby|空|くう}}{{Ruby|牙|が}}{{Ruby|団|だん}} ''Kūgadan'') in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] of monsters with different [[Type]]s, [[Attribute]]s and [[Level]]s that debuted in ''[[Dark Saviors]]''.
  Unique to this archetype, the support cards use the text '[monster/card] "Fur Hire"' instead of the [[PSCT]] standard '"[archetype]" [monster/card]'. This was intentional by Konami to incorporate the pun from their ''[[TCG]]'' names into their card effects, evident by continuing this trend outside their debut set.
  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  The monsters "Fur Hire" are anthropomorphic animals wearing armor.
  ===Etymology===
  In the ''[[TCG]]'' the archetype's name is a pun on "for hire", reflecting the fact they are mercenaries "Fur Hire".
  ==Members==
  The monsters "Fur Hire" can be split into 3 categories: low-Level Main Deck (Level 1-4), high-Level Main Deck (Level 5-8), and [[Link Monster]]s.
  ===Low-Level===
  The low-[[Level]] monsters "Fur Hire", except "[[Rex, Freight Fur Hire]]", each have an [[Ignition Effect]] to [[Special Summon]]s a different monster "Fur Hire" from the hand, and a [[Trigger Effect]] that activates if a monster "Fur Hire" is Special Summoned while that monster is face-up on the field. Instead of following the convention of the other monsters "Fur Hire", "Rex" instead has an on-Summon search effect and a [[Quick Effect]] that banishes itself from the [[GY]] to add to the hand, or Special Summon, a "Fur Hire" from the GY.

  ==Playing style==
  "Fur Hire" is primarily a [[Swarm]] Deck that aims to quickly fill the [[field]] with monsters from the [[hand]] by using the shared effects of the low-Level monsters "Fur Hire" to [[Special Summon]] more monsters "Fur Hire", who can keep the Summoning going. As they do this, the low-Level monsters "Fur Hire" also trigger their unique [[Trigger Effect]]s to maintain momentum. Since the monsters can only activate their effects once per turn, per name, it is necessary to play a large number and variety of low-Level monsters "Fur Hire". The last Special Summon will usually be a high-Level monster "Fur Hire", activating its Trigger Effect in addition to the protective effects it gives.

  To address consistency, the most important monster "Fur Hire" is "[[Beat, Bladesman Fur Hire]]", whose Trigger Effect searches a monster "Fur Hire" to ensure the Summons can continue, followed by "[[Filo, Messenger Fur Hire]]", whose Trigger Effect revives a monster "Fur Hire" from the [[Graveyard|GY]], granting resource recovery as an extender. Because there needs to be a monster "Fur Hire" on the field in order to start the Summons, the Deck can struggle if their first monster is removed from the field before it can activate its effect; [[Spell Cards]]s that Special Summon can alleviate the pressure on their [[Normal Summon]], such as "[[One for One]]" (for "Filo") or "[[Reasoning]]".

  The Deck's boss monster is the Link-3 "[[Folgo, Justice Fur Hire]]", whose [[Link Material]] requirement of 3 monsters with different Types is relatively easy to meet within the archetype "Fur Hire" due to its diverse array of monster Types. Upon its Summon, it Special Summons a monster "Fur Hire" from the Deck with a different Type from the Link Materials used, replenishing some of the advantage used to Summon it, and its other effect draws cards if an opponent's card is destroyed, depending on how many monsters "Fur Hire" the player controls. This works especially well with a "[[Donpa, Marksman Fur Hire]]" or "[[Recon, Scout Fur Hire]]" on the field who have not yet used their Trigger Effects, since they can activate in response to the [[Link Summon]] of "Folgo".

  The effects of all low-Level monsters "Fur Hire" can also be activated again during the opponent's turn, making cards that can Special Summon monsters "Fur Hire" during the opponent's turn to trigger them very valuable. These can include the in-archetype "[[Mayhem Fur Hire]]" and "[[Rookie Fur Hire]]", or out-of-archetype cards such as "[[Tri-Brigade Airborne Assault]]". This is especially important with "Donpa" or "Recon" on the field, to interrupt the opponent's plays and draw more cards with "Folgo". Also, as the archetype's swarming capability naturally lends it to Link Summoning, the Deck works well with non-archetypal staples such as the "[[Knightmare]]" monsters, "[[Borrel]]" monsters, "[[Accesscode Talker]]", and "[[Saryuja Skull Dread]]".

  Because there are several [[Beast]], [[Beast-Warrior]] and [[Winged Beast]] monsters "Fur Hire", with "Donpa" and "Recon" in particular being Level 2 Beast monsters, the archetype works well with cards and themes that support those Types, such as "[[Tri-Brigade]]" and "[[Melffy]]". Also, a small [[Sacred Beast]] engine can [[Card Tips:Folgo, Justice Fur Hire|consistently Summon "Folgo"]] off a 1-card starter.

  Due to already running a large number number of monsters, it is also possible to play a [[Monster Mash|pure monster]] variant Deck. This type of Deck "Fur Hire", can be supplemented with staple monsters such as "[[Dinowrestler Pankratops]]", hand traps like the [[Yo-kai Girl]]s, and a few Spells like "[[Sekka's Light]]" or "[[The Big Cattle Drive]]".

  ===Weaknesses===
  * The largest weakness Decks "Fur Hire" have is they are very reliant on performing numerous Summons in a turn. This can be interrupted in a few ways:
  ** The archetype desperately needs its Normal Summon to begin its chain of Special Summons, therefore any card that can negate Normal Summons will severely cripple the strategy "Fur Hire".
  ** Aside from the Normal Summon typically used to play the first monster, all other Summons are Special Summons, making cards like "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]" or "[[Vanity's Fiend]]" very effective.
  ** Cards like "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]", "[[Gozen Match]]" and "[[Unification]]" can prevent monsters "Fur Hire" from swarming the field, since they use all sorts of Attributes and Types.
  ** Monsters "Fur Hire" also heavily depend on their monster effects to swarm the field, making cards like "[[Skill Drain]]" or "[[Effect Veiler]]" very effective against the Deck.
  * All the Deck's removal options are targeting destruction effects (outside of the mediocre "[[Fandora, the Flying Furtress]]") making most modern boss monsters a challenge to get rid of, outside of Extra Deck options such as "[[Borreload Dragon]]".
