  "'''Favorite'''" (フェイバリット ''Feibaritto'') is an [[archetype]] of cards that are related to, or are support for the "[[HERO]]" or "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype.

  == Trivia == 
  *So far, all members and support for the "Favorite" archetype depict "[[Elemental HERO Flame Wingman]]" or one of its [[counterpart]]s in their artworks, with the said card being one of the [[signature card]]s of [[Jaden Yuki]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. The relationship between "Elemental HERO Flame Wingman" and the archetype's name is a reference to the verious instances in the anime where Jaden referred to the card as his "favorite hero" or "favorite card".
  **In {{episode|GX|167|ref}}, Jaden Yuki referred to "Elemental HERO Flame Wingman" as his "favorite hero" after he Fusion Summoned it, during his last Duel against Vellian Crowler.
  **Jaden also referred to "Flame Wingman" as his "favorite card" in {{episode|GX|001|ref}}: "The Next King of Games", when he Fusion Summoned it in his first Duel against Vellian Crowler, and in {{episode|GX|151|ref}}, when he Fusion Summoned it in his Duel against Jesse Anderson, who was possessed by Yubel.
