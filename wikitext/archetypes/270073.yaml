  "'''Super Defense Robot'''", known as "'''Super Defense Robo'''" ({{Ruby|ＳＤ|スーパーヂフェンス}}ロボ ''Sūpā Difensu Robo'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] monsters used by [[Orbital 7]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime. The goal of this archetype is to quickly [[Xyz Summon]] [[Rank]] 8 Xyz Monsters, particularly their ace "[[Googly-Eyes Drum Dragon]]".

  In the anime, they have a [[support]] card "[[Robocircus]]" that can aid in [[swarm]]ing, though in the ''OCG''/''TCG'', the monsters have a similar swarming effect instead. In addition, the cards can work together with the card version of "[[Orbital 7 (card)|Orbital 7]]". 

  All of the members are based on animals that commonly appeared in circus (even "Robocircus" itself is a circus), though their card names omit the last letter of the animals' names.

  ===Weaknesses===
  "Super Defense Robot" Decks are chock full of characteristics that make them one of the easiest Deck types to beat fairly quickly. First, being a Machine-Type archetype, they are easily predated upon via cards like "[[Magnetic Mosquito]]", "[[System Down]]" and "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]". Second, every "Super Defense Robot" monster (including "Orbital 7") have dismally low [[ATK]] and all of them except "Elephan" are [[Level]] 4, making them also a cakewalk as fodder for the "[[LV]]" "[[Armed Dragon]]"s, "[[Deck Destruction Virus]]", the tournament legal version of "[[Slifer the Sky Dragon]]", "[[King Tiger Wanghu]]", "[[Acidic Downpour]]" (for their EARTH Attribute) and "[[4-Starred Ladybug of Doom]]".  

  "[[Summon Breaker]]", "[[Summon Limit]]", "[[Narrow Pass]]" and any anti-[[Special Summon]]ing support can also handicap these Decks since their plurality Special Summoning strategy is one of their few, if not their only bright side of the archetype; "[[Skill Drain]]", "[[Mind Drain]]" and "[[Angel O7]]" can also achieve this. "[[Mystic Fairy Elfuria]]" can also sack Xyz Summoning bids, which are possibly their only medium of bringing significant offense to the field. Finally, "[[Soul Drain]]", "[[Silent Graveyard]]", "[[Royal Prison]]" and "[[Skull Meister]]" can sack "[[Googly-Eyes Drum Dragon]]" by averting its return from the [[Graveyard]].
