  "'''Burning Abyss'''", known as "'''Afterlife'''" ({{Ruby|彼|ひ}}{{Ruby|岸|がん}} ''Higan'') in Japan, is one of two [[TCG Exclusive|''TCG'' exclusive]] [[archetype]]s that debuted in ''[[Duelist Alliance]]'', alongside the "[[U.A.]]" archetype.
  ==Design==
  The archetype is based on ''[[wikipedia:Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', the first part of [[wikipedia:Dante Alighieri|Dante Alighieri]]'s 14th-century epic poem ''[[wikipedia:Divine Comedy|Divine Comedy]]''.
  ===Malebranche===
  The "Malebranche of the Burning Abyss" are named after the [[wikipedia:Malebranche (Divine Comedy)|Malebranche]], the demons who guard the fifth Bolgia of [[wikipedia:Malebolge|Malebolge]] (the Eighth Circle of Hell), known for their ruthless cruelty and responsible for the punishment of corrupt politicians by holding them under a boiling lake of pitch. Their English names are truncations of the original Italian names of the Malebranche. Most of their Japanese names are the names of the Malebranche used in [[wikipedia:Dorothy L. Sayers|Dorothy L. Sayers]]'s English translation of ''Inferno'', although "[[Alich, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss|Alich]]", "[[Barbar, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss|Barbar]]", and "[[Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss|Libic]]" use their original Italian names instead. They are all [[Level]] [[Level 3 Monster Cards|3]] [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] [[Effect Monsters]].
  "[[Malacoda, Netherlord of the Burning Abyss]]", as the leader of the "Malebranche", instead uses the title "Netherlord of the Burning Abyss" (he is still a member of the "Malebranche" in the source material). In English, unlike the "Malebranche of the Burning Abyss", "Malacoda's" name exactly matches its original Italian name. In Japanese, its name is Sayers's English name for the Malebranche as a whole, "Hellraker" (Sayers translates "Malacoda" as "Belzecue", which is not used in the card's name). It is a [[Level 6 Monster Cards|Level 6]] DARK Fiend [[Ritual Monster]].
  ==Members==
  ===[[Main Deck]]===
  Excluding the Ritual Monster "Malacoda", all Main Deck "Burning Abyss" monsters are named with the title "Malebranche of the Burning Abyss".

  ==Playing style==
  The "Burning Abyss" playstyle is focused on sending specific Main Deck "Burning Abyss" monsters to the Graveyard in order to activate their monster effects. Each Main Deck "Burning Abyss" monster, excluding the [[Ritual Monster]] "Malacoda", are Level 3 [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] monsters with three shared effects:
  # ''"If you control a monster that is not a "Burning Abyss" monster, destroy this card."''
  # ''"If you control no Spells/Traps: You can Special Summon this card from your hand."''
  # ''"If this card is sent to the GY: You can [Individual Effect]"''
  Effects 2 and 3 have an "[[only 1 effect once per turn]]" condition.

  The archetype's Ritual and Extra Deck monsters the main ways the Deck proactively sends "Burning Abyss" cards to the GY to trigger their GY effects. They each have one or more effects that send "Burning Abyss" cards to the GY, as well as a floating effect that triggers when they're sent to the GY themselves (usually only from the field).

  Between these Extra Deck and Ritual monsters, "Cherubini" "Dante, Traveler", and "Beatrice" are the main ones used in most "Burning Abyss" strategies, as they're easier to summon, and they send cards directly from the Deck to the GY.
  The individual effects of "Cherubini" and "Dante, Traveler" also gives the archetype good combat capabilities; "Cherubini" can protect monsters it points to from being destroyed by card effects and boost the ATK of other monsters, and "Dante, Traveler" can boost its own ATK by 1500. "Dante"'s floating effect is also the least restrictive among the "Burning Abyss" Extra Deck monsters, making it an important resource recovery point for the deck.
  Externally, the archetype commonly uses "[[Tour Guide From the Underworld]]" and "[[Fiendish Rhino Warrior]]" for additional swarming, searching, and utility.
  ===Pure===
  A pure "Burning Abyss" playstyle is a control playstyle where the player uses "Dante" and "Beatrice" to send "Burning Abyss" monsters to the GY and activate their supportive or disruptive effects, and "Dante" would be repeatedly sent to and revived from the GY (by "Cir") to reuse its GY recycle effect.
  The archetype's [[swarm]]ing capabilities allows it to serve as an engine for performing Rank 3 [[Xyz Summon]]s. In this role, they are commonly used to supplement "[[The Phantom Knights]]" archetype to provide more Level 3 materials for their Link and Rank 3 plays.

  ===Link Turbo===
  This build primarily relies on special summoning vast amounts of monsters from the hand or GY using monster effects, and using only a few draw spells such as "[[Pot of Desires]]" or "[[Sekka's Light]]" and no traps, thus ideally being able to OTK an opponent by summoning multiple high ATK monsters in one turn.
  This build uses a heavy amount of [[EARTH]] monsters, especially [[Rock]] monsters, in order to benefit from the effect of "[[Block Dragon]]" being able to control the GY, and generally runs one copy of many different cards in order to maximize benefit from "[[Orbital Hydralander]]".
  This build was most popular in 2018 and 2019, but fell out of competitive popularity in early 2020 due to "[[Sekka's Light]]", "[[Glow-Up Bulb]], and "Block Dragon" all being either limited or banned that year.

  ===Trap Heavy===
  This build became popular in 2020 after the limiting of "Sekka's Light" and banning of "Block Dragon" severely restricted the power of the aforementioned Link Turbo build. This more control-heavy build relies on using the effect of "[[Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal]]" and trap cards that discard or mill from the deck to further disrupt the opponent's plays and send additional "Burning Abyss" monsters to the GY to activate their effect. As "[[Absolute King Back Jack]]" can rearrange the top 3 cards of the Deck upon being sent to the GY, either Setting a Trap or milling a "Burning Abyss" monster to activate its effect, it is also a recommended target for the effect of "Beatrice".

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Being an archetype of primarily DARK monsters, they are susceptible to "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]".
  * If a key non-archetypal card has its effect negated, such as "[[Fiendish Rhino Warrior]]" and "[[Tour Guide From the Underworld]]", this can leave the deck in a very uncomfortable position as any "Malebranche" monsters will destroy themselves if on the field with such a card.
  * Since they all have effects that activate in the [[Graveyard]], cards like "[[Macro Cosmos]]", "[[Abyss Dweller]]", "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Soul Drain]]", "Masked HERO Dark Law" and "[[Debunk]]" are potential threats.
  * The Level 3 "Burning Abyss" monsters destroy themselves if their controller controls a non-"Burning Abyss" monster, so your opponent might disrupt you with cards/effects that give you monsters, such as "[[Ojama Trio]]", "[[Santa Claws]]", "[[Creature Swap]]", "[[Flying "C"]]", etc., although "[[Libic, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss|Libic]]" and "[[Farfa, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss|Farfa]]" can help maneuver around such strategies.
  * Since face-down monsters are not treated as "Burning Abyss" monsters, "[[Quaking Mirror Force]]", "[[Evilswarm Nightmare]]", or other cards that can set opponent's monsters face-down can make things very difficult for "Burning Abyss" Decks, since any "Malebranche of the Burning Abyss" Summoned while there is a face-down monster will destroy itself.
  * If using a rapid-fire Summon build, such as "[[Sekka's Light]]" or "[[Orbital Hydralander]]" Turbo, the deck can be very specific in terms of content. As such, these builds can have a steep learning curve. Especially as "Malebranche of the Burning Abyss" monsters will destroy themselves if there is a non-Archetypal monster on the field, it is advisable for players new to these builds to limit the number of non-archetype Monsters in the deck to the barest minimum - "Fiendish Rhino Warrior" and "Tour Guide From the Underworld" are generally regarded as the most acceptable options, as are [[hand traps]] that the deck does not intend to summon. If using a trap-heavy build, "[[Absolute King Back Jack]]" is also recommended as it is generally milled or discarded from the hand or deck directly to the GY, and also not usually ever summoned.
  * If using the a build relying almost entirely on monster effects, any card that can restrict monster effects, such as [[Mystic Mine]], [[Majesty's Fiend]], or [[Inspector Boarder]] will near completely control this deck's capabilities.
