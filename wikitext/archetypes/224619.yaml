  "'''Fire King'''" ({{Ruby|炎|えん}}{{Ruby|王|おう}} ''En'ō'') is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Beast]], [[Beast-Warrior]], and [[Winged Beast]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that are mainly focused on self-destruction. They were first introduced in the ''[[OCG]]'' in ''[[Structure Deck: Onslaught of the Fire Kings]]'' and ''[[TCG]]'' in ''[[Onslaught of the Fire Kings Structure Deck]]''.

  == Story ==

  {{See also|[[Gagaga Academy Tospedia card storylines#"Onslaught of the Fire Kings" edition|Gagaga Academy Tospedia card storylines]]|[[Master Guide 4 card storylines#File No. 01: The Great Battle Raging between Fire and Water in the South Seas|Master Guide 4 card storylines]]}}
  The "Fire Kings" live on a [[Fire King Island|volcanic island]] lying in the southern seas. Using their powers over the fire, they can [[Circle of the Fire Kings|reincarnate]], and grow using its powers again. When the "Fire Kings" saw their [[Sanctuary of the Fire Kings|temple]] [[Phantasm Spiral Assault|threatened]] by the "[[Atlantean]]" army, they [[High Tide on Fire Island|fought back]] in equal strength, only enough to keep the invaders away from their island.

  == Design ==

  The "Fire King" monsters are based on deities from different cultures, mostly from South/Southeast Asia and the Far East, with most of its members being inspired in [[wikipedia:Hindu deities|Hindu gods]]. The archetype's general mechanic of destroying its own monsters and Special Summoning them upon each other's destruction also reference practices, beliefs and concepts that are typical to Hinduism and [[wikipedia:Buddhism|Buddhism]] and their cosmologies, such as death, reincarnation, and [[wikipedia:Self-immolation|self-immolation]].

  ===Naming in the ''[[TCG]]''===

  The name of the archetype is noted on French and Portuguese cards respectively as "Roi(s) du Feu" and "Rei(s) de Fogo" to make sure that support cards work with ''all'' "Fire King" cards. In Italian, the word "re" can be a plural form on its own, so no problem would occur. On Spanish cards, the name is just noted as "Rey de Fuego", which could potentially exclude "[[Circle of the Fire Kings]]" and "[[Onslaught of the Fire Kings]]" from the archetype; however, this would not prompt any problem so far as support cards only support "Fire King" monsters.

  == Playing style ==

  The "Fire King" monsters benefit from being destroyed by card effects and some of them have effects that revolve around destroying one another. "[[Legendary Fire King Ponix]]" can Special Summon itself if a FIRE monster is destroyed and can search the Spell/Trap support upon being Summoned. Such trigger effect is also present in monsters like "[[Sacred Fire King Garunix|Sacred Garunix]]", "[[Fire King Avatar Hanuman|Hanuman]]", and "[[Fire King Avatar Barong|Barong]]". Other common feature is a delayed trigger effect the Graveyard during the Standby Phase, present in "Barong", "[[Fire King High Avatar Garunix]]", and "Ponix". The starting point of the strategy is most often "[[Fire King Island]]", that can search "Fire King" monsters while destroying another one in the process, potentially igniting a sequence of trigger effects that results in field presence and the access to monster and/or Spell/Trap negation with "Hanuman" and "[[Fire King Avatar Arvata|Arvata]]". Among other Spell/Trap support, "[[Circle of the Fire Kings]]" and "[[Fire King Sacred Immolation]]" standout, by providing either the Special Summon of monsters or the destruction of opponent's cards. Generic support cards that may help the Deck include "[[Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys]]", "[[Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos]]", "[[True King Agnimazud, the Vanisher]]", etc. Also, "[[Fire Formation - Tenki]]" can search the Level 4 "Fire King" monsters and "[[Rekindling]]" can revive many of them if needed.
