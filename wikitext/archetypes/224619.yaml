  "'''Fire King'''" ({{Ruby|炎|えん}}{{Ruby|王|おう}} ''En'ō'') is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Beast]], [[Beast-Warrior]], and [[Winged Beast]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that are mainly focused on self-destruction. They were first introduced in the ''[[OCG]]'' in ''[[Structure Deck: Onslaught of the Fire Kings]]'' and ''[[TCG]]'' in ''[[Onslaught of the Fire Kings Structure Deck]]''.

  == Story ==
  {{See also|[[Gagaga Academy Tospedia card storylines#"Onslaught of the Fire Kings" edition|Gagaga Academy Tospedia card storylines]]|[[Master Guide 4 card storylines#File No. 01: The Great Battle Raging between Fire and Water in the South Seas|Master Guide 4 card storylines]]}}
  The "Fire Kings" live on "[[Fire King Island]]", a volcanic island lying in the southern seas. Using their powers over the fire, they can [[Circle of the Fire Kings|reincarnate]], and grow using its powers again. When the "Fire Kings" saw their temple threatened by the "[[Atlantean]]" army, they fought back in equal strength, only enough to keep the invaders away from their island.

  == Design ==
  ===Naming in the ''[[TCG]]''===
  The name of the archetype is noted on French and Portuguese cards respectively as "Roi(s) du Feu" and "Rei(s) de Fogo" to make sure that support cards work with ''all'' "Fire King" cards. In Italian, the word "re" can be a plural form on its own, so no problem would occur. On Spanish cards, the name is just noted as "Rey de Fuego", which could potentially exclude "[[Circle of the Fire Kings]]" and "[[Onslaught of the Fire Kings]]" from the archetype; however, this would not prompt any problem so far as support cards only support "Fire King" monsters.

  === Appearance ===
  Each of the "Fire King" monsters has a different surrounding flame color, possibly indicating different levels of the intensity of their flames.
  The "Fire King" monsters seem to be based off of different creatures in different Asian mythologies, [[wikipedia:Hinduism|Hinduism]], and the culture of the Indonesian island of [[wikipedia:Bali|Bali]].

  == Playing style ==
  Fire King revolves heavily around effect destruction: effects commonly destroy cards on the field, trigger when they or another card is destroyed by a card effect, or destroy other cards in your possession to trigger said effects. While you can most consistently access FIRE Beast, Beast-Warrior, and Winged Beast monsters (such as through "[[Sacred Fire King Garunix]]"), effects like "[[Fire King Avatar Yaksha]]" can destroy any monster in your hand or on your field, providing potential albeit inconsistent tech options.
