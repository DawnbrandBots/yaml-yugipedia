  "'''Springans'''", known as "'''Sprigguns'''" (スプリガンズ ''Supuriganzu'') in the Japanese version, is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Machine]] monsters, with the exception of the [[DARK]] [[Beast]] "[[Springans Kitt]]", that debuted in ''[[Blazing Vortex]]''.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX card storylines#No. 01: The Closed Land|The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines#No. 01: The Land of the Abyss}}
  The "Springans" archetype shares the same universe as the "[[Dogmatika]]" and "[[Tri-Brigade]]" archetypes, as seen in the artworks of their Spells and Traps.

  ==Etymology==
  [[wikipedia:Spriggan|Spriggan]]s are legendary creatures from the fairy tradition of [[wikipedia:Cornish mythology|Cornish mythology]]. Spriggans are especially associated with [[wikipedia:West Penwith|West Penwith]] in [[wikipedia:Cornwall|Cornwall]].

  ==Design==
  [[File:SpringansRockey-ConceptArt.png|thumb|left|200px|Concept art of "[[Springans Rockey]]".]]
  The "Springans" monsters are soot-based life forms wearing missile, torpedo, and cannon armor. Some, such as "[[Springans Rockey|Rockey]]", can fold their bodies into their respective weapons to attack.

  ==Playing style==
  All [[Main Deck]] "Springans" monsters share the same [[effect]], which allows them to [[attach]] themselves from the [[hand]], [[field]] or [[GY]] to a "Springans" [[Xyz Monster]] the player controls. Combined with the [[Field Spell]] "[[Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda]]", which can [[Special Summon]] a "Springans" Xyz Monster from the [[Extra Deck]] if the player does not control one, they can bring out their Xyz Monsters without having to gather [[material]]s on the field to [[Xyz Summon]] it, and re-attach materials to it each turn.

  Their Xyz Monster, "[[Springans Ship - Exblowrer]]", has an effect to [[destroy]] a number of the opponent's cards equal to the number of materials detached, and another to [[banish]] itself until the [[End Phase]]. Combining this with the other "Springans", "Ship - Exblowrer" can destroy several of the opponent's cards during the player's turn, and banish itself during the opponent's to protect itself and repeat the process.

  While "Ship - Exblowrer" can destroy cards during the player's turn, "[[Springans Captain Sargas]]" can detach materials from other Xyz Monsters to destroy 1 face-up card during the opponent's turn. "[[Springans Call!]]" can Special Summon 1 "Springans" monsters from the GY. Since Xyz Monsters Special Summoned by "Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda" cannot be Special Summoned back from the GY, "Springans Call!" can Summon "Captain Sargas" instead, in order to use its effect.

  As they don't necessarily have to use monsters to Xyz Summon, they can instead use their [[Normal Summon]] on monsters such as "[[Scrap Recycler]]" to [[send]] "Springans" from the Deck to the GY. In addition, the player can also opt to run "[[Scrap Golem]]", "[[Crystron Rosenix]]", "[[Scrap Wyvern]]", and "[[Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion]]", which will send 2 "Springans" instead. "Recycler" can send "Rosenix" to the GY, which can Special Summon 1 "[[Crystron Token]]". Both "Recycler" and the Token can be used to Summon "Wyvern", then its effect can Summon "Golem" from the Deck, and "Golem" can Summon back "Recycler" from the GY, activating its effect to send 1 Machine monster to the GY. Next, all of the three "Scrap" monsters can be used to Summon "Curious", sending another card from the Deck to the GY. This can be combined with "[[Springans Brothers]]", which can Special Summon the other "Springans" monster sent to the GY with this combo.
