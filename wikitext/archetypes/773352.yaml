  "'''Springans'''", known as "'''Sprigguns'''" (スプリガンズ ''Supuriganzu'') in the Japanese version, is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Machine]] monsters, with the exception of the [[DARK]] [[Beast]] "[[Springans Kitt]]", that debuted in ''[[Blazing Vortex]]''.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX card storylines#No. 01: The Closed Land|The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines#No. 01: The Land of the Abyss}}
  The "Springans" archetype shares the same universe as the "[[Dogmatika]]" and "[[Tri-Brigade]]" archetypes, as seen in the artworks of their Spells and Traps. 
  After Albaz and Ecclesia escaped Dogmatika with the help of Shuraig and the Tri-Brigade, they wandered in the great sand sea Golgonda. There they were captured by the Springans and were brought upon their ship. While discussing their fates Kitt, a young member of the Tri-Brigade that was living with the Springans on the desert. She saw the little mechanical bird Mercourier be with them and knew they were friends. After Albaz and Ecclesia passed a trial the Springans gave them, they welcomed them as part of the team. 
  After a while, they faced off against the great serpent of the Golgonda desert, they gave a parting gift to them and said their goodbyes with Albaz and Ecclesia, all except a small Springan that hide itself in the new hammer Ecclesia made from some a skull loot from her trial. After going their separate ways, Kitt didn't felt so good leaving their new friends to their fate. She along with Sargas travelled to the land of iron where the Therion Discolosseum was so they could aqcuaire the power to fight the forces of evil that were the Dogmatika and the Despia. After entering the arena, the overseer of the entire place, Argyro agreed to allow them only if one of them could beat every fighter of the colosseum. Sargas faced off against all of them with Kitt cheering him that he can do it etc. After defeating every Therion, even "King" Regulus, Argyro was angry that his fighters lost, so much so that it created a new enemy to eradicate Kitt and the Springans, the Spright. After a brutal battle and a team up of Sargas and Regulus, Argyro was defeated, the Springans got access to the power they needed and they started preparing the weapons for the final fight against the true enemy. 
  During the final fight, while everything seemed hopeless, Kitt and the Springans appeard to save the day, Kitt gave Shuraig a new powerful weapon to use, and he along with a newly upgraded Sargas who was now the Champion of the Therion arena, defeated the biggest of the Bystials, the humongous Alba Los. 

  ==Etymology==
  [[wikipedia:Spriggan|Spriggan]]s are legendary creatures from the fairy tradition of [[wikipedia:Cornish mythology|Cornish mythology]]. Spriggans are especially associated with [[wikipedia:West Penwith|West Penwith]] in [[wikipedia:Cornwall|Cornwall]].

  ==Design==
  [[File:SpringansRockey-ConceptArt.png|thumb|left|200px|Concept art of "[[Springans Rockey]]".]]
  The "Springans" monsters are soot-based life forms wearing missile, torpedo, and cannon armor. Some, such as "[[Springans Rockey|Rockey]]", can fold their bodies into their respective weapons to attack.

  ==Playing style==
  All [[Main Deck]] "Springans" monsters share the same [[effect]], which allows them to [[attach]] themselves from the [[hand]], [[field]] or [[GY]] to a "Springans" [[Xyz Monster]] the player controls. Combined with the [[Field Spell]] "[[Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda]]", which can [[Special Summon]] a "Springans" Xyz Monster from the [[Extra Deck]] if the player does not control one, they can bring out their Xyz Monsters without having to gather [[material]]s on the field to [[Xyz Summon]] it, and re-attach materials to it each turn.

  Their Xyz Monster, "[[Springans Ship - Exblowrer]]", has an effect to [[destroy]] a number of the opponent's cards equal to the number of materials detached, and another to [[banish]] itself until the [[End Phase]]. Combining this with the other "Springans", "Ship - Exblowrer" can destroy several of the opponent's cards during the player's turn, and banish itself during the opponent's to protect itself and repeat the process.

  While "Ship - Exblowrer" can destroy cards during the player's turn, "[[Springans Captain Sargas]]" can detach materials from other Xyz Monsters to destroy 1 face-up card during the opponent's turn. "[[Springans Call!]]" can Special Summon 1 "Springans" monsters from the GY. Since Xyz Monsters Special Summoned by "Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda" cannot be Special Summoned back from the GY, "Springans Call!" can Summon "Captain Sargas" instead, in order to use its effect.

  As they don't necessarily have to use monsters to Xyz Summon, they can instead use their [[Normal Summon]] on monsters such as "[[Scrap Recycler]]" to [[send]] "Springans" from the Deck to the GY. In addition, the player can also opt to run "[[Scrap Golem]]", "[[Crystron Rosenix]]", "[[Scrap Wyvern]]", and "[[Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion]]", which will send 2 "Springans" instead. "Recycler" can send "Rosenix" to the GY, which can Special Summon 1 "[[Crystron Token]]". Both "Recycler" and the Token can be used to Summon "Wyvern", then its effect can Summon "Golem" from the Deck, and "Golem" can Summon back "Recycler" from the GY, activating its effect to send 1 Machine monster to the GY. Next, all of the three "Scrap" monsters can be used to Summon "Curious", sending another card from the Deck to the GY. This can be combined with "[[Springans Brothers]]", which can Special Summon the other "Springans" monster sent to the GY with this combo.
