  "'''Laval'''" (ラヴァル ''Ravaru'') is an [[archetype]] first released in ''[[Duel Terminal - Vylon Descends!!]]''. Their team symbol is an orange flame often carved into a flat stone or disc. All known "Laval" monsters have [[FIRE]] as their [[Attribute]], as well as the majority of them being either [[Pyro]] or [[Warrior]].

  ==Duel Terminal Storyline==
  [[File:LavalCrest.png|100px|left|thumb|The "Laval" crest.]]
  The Laval live in a lava zone that's surrounded by Fiery Woodlands. A tribe that's born for battling, all they want to do is fight. For that purpose, they attacked the [[Gem-Knight]] repeatedly to start a new conflict. However, the [[Steelswarm]]s started to take over the surface land. So, the Lavals went to work with the other clans. Forming a temporary union with the [[Vylon]], they obtained [[Laval Stennon|new powers]] to fight back the Steelswarms. Soon, the union finally defeated the invaders, but conflicts haven't lowered yet; the Vylons decided to stop fights between clans by exterminating them completely. Later, the Lavals teamed up with the other clans again in order to stop the Vylon's actions. They [[Lavalval Dragun|fused their]] [[Lavalval Ignis|powers to]] [[Daigusto Phoenix|fight back]] this order.

  After defeating the Vylons, the union disbanded, and the Lavals went working as a [[Lavalval Chain|new power source]] for the rituals of the [[Gishki]] tribe. Since then, the current fate of Laval tribe is unknown.

  == Design ==

  === Appearance ===
  Visually, most "Laval" monsters appears to be made out of molten rock or molten lava.

  === Etymology ===
  The archetype's name is a corruption of the word "lava", which is similar to how the "[[Flamvell]]" archetype was named.

  == Playing style ==
  Most "Laval" monsters [[mill]] and use other "Laval" monsters in the [[Graveyard]]. Some, like "[[Laval Coatl]]", simply need enough "Lavals" in the Graveyard to work. Others, like "[[Laval Judgment Lord]]", [[banish]] "Lavals" from the Graveyard for costs. Lastly, cards like "[[Laval Cannon]]" recycle "Lavals" that have been banished by other effects. The "Laval" Synchro Monsters require 1 or more non-Tuner FIRE monsters and are all based around managing the "Lavals" in the Graveyard with their effects.

  This archetype focuses on setting up its Graveyard to enable several effects from both the field and Graveyard, most easily done via "[[Molten Conduction Field]]", a straight upgrade to "[[Foolish Burial]]". By using "Laval Volcano Handmaiden" and another "Laval" for the effect of "Molten Conduction Field", one is able to put an even greater number of monsters into the Graveyard. 

  Once the Graveyard setup is complete, "Laval" can use a number of options, from using massive swarming and overwhelming the opponent with numerous [[Synchro Monster]]s/[[Link Monster]]s to clearing the opposing board with "[[Dustflame Blast]]. The main swarming strategy utilizes "[[Rekindling]]" to revive many "Laval" monsters with 200 DEF, with "Laval Magma Cannoneer" being the ideal non-Tuner due to being Level 4 and able to set up the Graveyard on its own. Notable candidates for the deck are certain "[[Flamvell]]" monsters to increase the deck's speed, namely "[[Flamvell Firedog]]" and "[[Neo Flamvell Lady]]". "Firedog" is especially useful because it can search for many of the "Laval" Tuners. With "Rekindling", this Deck is capable of unleashing massive Synchro Monsters such as "[[Shooting Quasar Dragon]]" or "[[Red Nova Dragon]]" on the first turn, even though this requires a fair amount of card luck to be achieved. As for the Link Summon side, "[[Searing Fire Wall]]" can be used for massive Link Summoning plays after a successful "Molten Conduction Field" activation, as well as offering pinpoint banishing possibilities.

  "[[Laval Cannon]]" can allow for a degree of toolboxing [[banished]] Lavals. Cards that [[banish]] your "Laval" cards, like "[[Gold Sarcophagus]]", can set up "Cannon". "[[Laval Lakeside Lady]]" can be easily set up and banished for "Cannon" to summon either her or the other "Laval" monster she banished, as can "Laval Volcano Handmaiden" who can be used as Link Material for cards like "[[Linkuriboh]]" to hit the Graveyard and therefore trigger her effect.

  The archetype can work well with "[[Lightsworn]]" and other self-milling Decks. Another good partner archetype is "Flamvell" since both archetypes are FIRE and many of the members, including a few [[Synchro Monster]]s, have 200 DEF. "[[Laval Forest Sprite]]", "[[Laval Volcano Handmaiden]]", "[[Laval Lancelord]]" and "[[Kayenn, the Master Magma Blacksmith]]" can benefit from cards like "[[Flamvell Firedog]]" or "[[Rekindling]]" to swarm the field.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Since Laval strategies are [[Graveyard]]-dependent, cards that directly [[banish]] cards, like "[[Macro Cosmos]]" and "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" can be highly harmful to the Deck - however, "Laval Cannon" can counter this up to a certain point. By the same token, cards like "[[Necrovalley]]", "[[The End of Anubis]]" and "[[Silent Graveyard]]" are dangerous due to disrupting several key effects such as those of "Handmaiden" or "Lakeside Lady".
  * Anti-Special Summon cards such as "[[Archlord Kristya]]" and "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]" can also force this Deck into a screeching halt.
  * Much like other [[FIRE]]-based archetypes, this Deck is highly oriented towards "Rekindling", and they tend to be very vulnerable if it is negated.
  * Similarly to the "[[Gusto]]" archetype, "[[Discord]]" makes a potent counter against more Synchro-oriented versions of "Laval" Decks.
