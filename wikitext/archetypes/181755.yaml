  "'''Gimmick Puppet'''" (ギミック・パペット ''Gimmikku Papetto'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that are used by [[Quattro]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime. They are also a sub-archetype of the "[[Puppet]]" archetype.

  Initially, the only "Gimmick Puppet" monsters used by [[Quattro]] that were released were "[[Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll]]", "[[Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll]]", "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder]]", "[[Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings]]", and "[[Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo]]", however the ''TCG'' release of ''[[Number Hunters]]'' brought with it several more of the archetype's Monster Cards, making a pure "Gimmick Puppet" Deck possible. As the ''Yu-Gi-Oh ZEXAL'' anime progressed, several more "Gimmick Puppet" cards were unveiled, including three "[[Number C]]" monsters. All of these new monsters and some previously not yet released in the ''TCG'' have been released in the ''[[Premium Gold]]'' set.

  ==Design==
  [[File:GimmickPuppet.png|200px|left|thumb|[[Quattro]] (back), with "[[Gimmick Puppet Egg Head (anime)|Egg Head]]" and "[[Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll (anime)|Dreary Doll]]" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|anime]].]] 
  In the dub of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL'' anime, most of the "Gimmick Puppet" monsters' appearances are cut or obscured, likely due to their horrific designs.

  ==Playing style==
  The monsters and associated cards are geared towards Summoning [[Level]] [[Level 8 Monster Cards|8 monsters]] to [[Xyz Summon]] their ace monsters; "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder]]", "[[Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings]]", and "[[Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo]]".

  "Gimmick Puppet" monsters don't have high [[ATK]] (the strongest non-[[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] being the [[Level]] 4 "[[Gimmick Puppet Egg Head]]"), but have [[Monster effect|effects]] ranging from [[stall]]ing, [[swarm]]ing and even Summoning monsters to the opponent's side of the field for effect manipulation. Their main strategy is taking advantage of the opponent's monsters with high ATK to deal [[effect damage]] with their ace monsters; "[[Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings]]" and "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder]]". "[[Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo]]" offers an [[Victory Condition#Special Victory conditions|alternate victory strategy]] with its effect. Most "Gimmick Puppet" monsters tend to be high Leveled and can be Special Summoned with ease, although some of them have to be Special Summoned by different methods, such as "[[Gimmick Puppet Twilight Joker]]", which requires the player to banish a "Gimmick Puppet" that was [[destroyed by battle]].

  "Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder" has the effect to destroy 2 Special Summoned opponent monsters on the field, dealing damage equal to the [[original ATK]] of any Xyz Monster destroyed in this way. Its upgraded form, "[[Number C15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter]]", deals effect damage for any destroyed monster, but its effect can only be activated once per turn (for a total of three destroying effects).

  "Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings" has a similar theme of effect damage, but the player needs "Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings" to complete its destroying effect in the same turn. "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings'" effect activates when it is Special Summoned, and it can also be revived without the need for Xyz Material for a field nuke. With an Xyz Material, it can function as fuel for its Summon-Triggered effect, "[[Xyz Reborn]]" or something similar is recommended for this strategy.

  "[[Marshalling Field]]" and "[[Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force]]" both give many chances to Summon the "[[Number C]]" forms for stronger effect damage and "[[Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo]]". "Number 88: Gimmick Puppet Destiny Leo" and "Disaster Leo's" effects are alternate [[Victory condition|win conditions]] that are far off the archetype's mild focus on effect damage and should be used just as a last strategy.
