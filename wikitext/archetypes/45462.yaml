  "'''Blackwing'''", known as "'''Black Feather'''" ({{Ruby|ＢＦ|ブラックフェザー}} ''Burakku Fezā'') in the Japanese version, is an [[archetype]] of [[Monster Card|monsters]], debuting in ''[[Crimson Crisis]]'', used by both [[Crow Hogan]] and [[Robert Pearson]], with the former inheriting the Deck from the latter, in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime. They were also used in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime by Crow's [[Crow Hogan (ARC-V)|alternate universe counterpart]]. All members of this archetype are [[DARK]] [[Winged Beast]] monsters, except for the [[LIGHT]] "[[Blackwing - Aurora the Northern Lights]]" and the [[Warrior]] "[[Blackwing Tamer - Obsidian Hawk Joe]]".
  ==Design==
  [[File:Blackwing lineart.png|thumb|left|180px|Linework]]
  Most "Blackwing" monsters generally have a very bird-like appearance, with most [[Level]] 3 and lower members appearing as small birds while the [[Level]] 4 and higher monsters appearing to be either humanoids in bird-like outfits or humanoid birds. They also have a prominent black color-scheme in their design, usually on their wing feathering.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Blackwing" archetype is focused on [[swarm]]ing monsters for [[Synchro Summon]]ing, with a number of secondary focuses including [[hand trap]]-like effects, [[counter]] usage, ATK modulation, interactions with "[[Black-Winged Dragon]]", inflicting burn damage in multiples of 700, and non-standard methods of Special Summoning [[Synchro Monster]]s (e.g. the "GY Synchro" effect of "[[Blackwing - Vayu the Emblem of Honor|Vayu]]", which historically formed a deck known as "Vayu Turbo" or "Vayusworn" when paired up with self-milling cards like "[[Card Trooper]]" or "[[Lightsworn]]" monsters to [[List of unofficial terms#Turbo|turbo]] out its effect). Historical "Blackwing" Decks were played as control Decks focusing on using the archetype's excellent Normal Summons, backed up with the potential for swarming and combo plays. Later "Blackwing" Decks evolved into swarming-based combo Decks revolving around the searching power of "[[Black Whirlwind]]".
  "Blackwing" has a strong emphasis on [[swarm]]ing monsters from the hand. Most monsters have the ability to [[Special Summon]] themselves from the [[hand]]; others carry special effects that utilize the [[Graveyard]] and hand to advance the gamestate.
  Since all of the "Blackwing" monsters rely on the hand for swarming, "[[Black Whirlwind]]" allows them to replenish their resources while giving them the ability to toolbox into certain combo pieces. And when enough "Blackwing" cards have swarmed the [[field]], support cards like "[[Delta Crow - Anti Reverse]]" and "[[Black Sonic]]" are granted additional effects that allow them to be activated from the hand.
  As a primarily [[DARK]] and [[Winged Beast]] Deck, the Deck benefits from their related Typing and Attribute support. Because most "Blackwing" cards do not impose any significant summoning restrictions, the Deck can use its swarming potential to pivot into a variety of non-"Blackwing" combos. In particular, "[[Raidraptor - Wise Strix]]" opens up a wide variety of combos involving Xyz Monsters, "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]", and even "[[The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche]]", all the while operating under the DARK Extra Deck lock of combo starter "[[Blackwing - Simoon the Poison Wind|Simoon the Poison Wind]]".

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Aside from "[[Blackwing Full Armor Master]]", the archetype has a general lack of in-archetype boss monsters or easily searchable disruptions with field holding powers, and so often has to rely on the Xyz boss monsters and searchable disruptions provided by "[[Raidraptor - Wise Strix|Wise Strix]]" and "[[The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche|Rusty Bardiche]]" combos.
  * The search effect from "[[Black Whirlwind]]" is affected by effects that reduce ATK, such as "[[Burden of the Mighty]]" or "[[Solidarity]]", and the Deck's combos can be potentially disrupted by such effects.
  * Most "Blackwing" [[swarm]]ing effects require at least 1 "Blackwing" on the field as a precondition, so destroying the first summon of a "Blackwing" monster can potentially stop the Deck's combos.
  * "Blackwing" cards provide limited recovery options, making it difficult for the Deck to comeback should it be hit with an equalizer like "[[Torrential Tribute]]".
  * Due to the importance of searching for the Deck's combos, anti-search cards like "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]", "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]", and "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" can cripple the Deck's combos.
  * As a swarming-based Deck, the Deck is weak to "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]".
  * As a DARK Deck, the Deck is countered by anti-DARK cards like "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]".
  * Since the Deck has some need for the GY to make plays, anti-GY cards like "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" can significantly disrupt the Deck's combos.
