  "'''Majestic'''", known as "'''Savior'''" (セイヴァー ''Seivā'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of Level 10+ [[Synchro Monster]]s, all requiring "[[Majestic Dragon]]" as the [[Tuner monster]] requirement. These monsters are upgraded counterparts to the [[Signer Dragon]]s used by the [[Signer]]s of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'', granted to them temporarily by the power of the [[Crimson Dragon]].

  Due to its Japanese name, "[[Avendread Savior]]" is also a member of this archetype. However, because TCG/OCG support for this archetype only supports "Majestic" Synchro Monsters, this is not an issue. 

  ==Members==
  During ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'', the [[Mark of the Dragon]] disappears from the Signers, only to re-appear on the back of a single Signer, who then draws "[[Majestic Dragon]]" for their next draw. Only two of the Signers, [[Yusei Fudo]] and [[Jack Atlas]], make use of this during the series' run, however, so no "Majestic" counterpart to the other Signer Dragons exists.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Majestic" Synchro Monsters return to the [[Extra Deck]] during the [[End Phase]] and [[Special Summon]] the corresponding base [[Signer Dragons|Dragon]] back from the [[Graveyard]]. Their effects are similar to their [[Signer Dragons|Signer Dragon's]] counterpart, except they are more powerful; they can also negate the effect of an opponent's [[face-up]] monster and get an advantage from the negated card until the [[End Phase]]. One easy way to summon the "Majestic" monsters is by Synchro Summoning "[[Malefic Paradox Dragon]]" without a "[[Malefic World]]" so it's destroyed and then using "[[Shadow Impulse]]".
