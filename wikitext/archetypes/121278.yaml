  '''"Meklord"''', known as '''"Machine Imperial"''' ({{Ruby|機|き}}{{Ruby|皇|こう}} ''Kikō'') in the ''[[OCG]]'' and the English dubbed version of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime until [[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's - Episode 103|episode 103]], are an anti-[[Synchro]] [[archetype]] used by the three main villains of the third arc of the ''5D's'' anime: the [[Three Pure Nobles]] and their combined form, [[Aporia]]. The archetype is split into several groups: "[[Meklord Emperor]]", "[[Meklord Astro]]", and "[[Meklord Army]]". The component pieces of the "Meklord Emperors" are also represented in the "[[Wisel]]", "[[Skiel]]", "[[Granel]]" and "[[Attack (archetype)|Attack]]" archetypes.
  == Appearance ==
  {{Main|Meklord Emperor|Meklord Army}}
  The "Meklord Emperors" and "Meklord Astros" have their colors representing material. "[[Meklord Emperor Wisel|Wisel]]" is silver, "[[Meklord Emperor Skiel|Skiel]]" is sapphire and "[[Meklord Emperor Granel|Granel]]" is gold, "[[Meklord Astro Mekanikle|Mekanikle]]" is platinum, and "[[Meklord Astro Dragon Asterisk|Asterisk]]" is an amalgam of the three previous "Meklord Emperors".

  The first three "Meklord Emperors" have been released as stand-alone cards, albeit with their whole form in a single card instead of 5. They retain their [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] stealing [[effect]], and "Wisel" and "Skiel" are the only [[Monster Card|monsters]] that can [[attack]] whilst on the field. "Granel", though, still allows other monsters to attack. However, instead of having to [[destroy]] a Core monster, they are Summoned when ''any'' monster is destroyed by a card effect, making them highly splashable. Additionally, "Wisel" has the ability to negate [[Spell Card]]s, "Granel" can [[Special Summon]] the Synchro Monsters [[equip]]ped by its effect and "Skiel" is able to attack [[Direct attack|directly]] by [[send]]ing an equipped monster to the [[Graveyard]]. "Meklord Astro Mekanikle", "Meklord Emperor Wisel" and "Meklord Emperor Granel" are ''[[V Jump promotional cards|V Jump Promotional Card]]''. The "[[Meklord Army]]", weaker incarnations of the "Meklord Emperors" used by [[Aporia]], as well as "[[Meklord Astro Dragon Asterisk]]", and other support cards for this archetype were released in ''[[Extreme Victory]]'', alongisde "Meklord Emperor Skiel" in the set's ''TCG'' release.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Meklord" archetype focuses on destroying their own cards in order to [[Special Summon]] the "[[Meklord Emperor]]" monsters, who can power themselves up by taking advantage of the opponent's [[Synchro Monster]]s. Their monsters can be quickly [[search]]ed with "[[Meklord Assembly]]", which in turn can be searched by "[[Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core]]"; these two cards go especially well together as "Assembly" can destroy "Infinity Core" with its second effect to Special Summon a "Meklord Emperor" from the Deck.

  The sub-archetype "[[Meklord Army]]" supplements this play style with an emphasis on maintaining field presence. "[[Fortissimo the Mobile Fortress]]" can Special Summon a "Meklord Army" monster each turn, "[[Meklord Army of Skiel]]" [[Floater|floats]] into another when it's destroyed by battle, and "[[Meklord Army Deployer Obbligato]]" Special Summons two from the Deck while destroying itself to potentially trigger the effect of a "Meklord Emperor" monster in the hand. As all of these monsters are Level 4, "Fortissimo" or "Obbligato" can quickly facilitate a Rank 4 [[Xyz Summon]], such as "[[Gear Gigant X]]" to search even more Machine monsters, or a [[Link Summon]] of "[[Platinum Gadget]]" to Special Summon another monster from the hand.

  The "[[Meklord Astro]]" monsters are additional powerful monsters to use in addition to the "Meklord Emperors". Notably, "[[Meklord Astro Dragon Triskelion]]" can equip a monster from the opponent's [[Extra Deck]] to itself, mitigating the archetype's reliance on the opponent Summoning Synchro Monsters. Its Summoning procedure can be easily met thanks to "Obbligato".

  As a [[Machine]] archetype, "Meklord" benefits from more generic Machine support cards. "[[Gold Gadget]]", "[[Silver Gadget]]" and "[[Iron Call]]" provide additional ways to quickly Summon "Gear Gigant X" or "Platinum Gadget"; the latter destroying the Summoned monster during the End Phase can also sometimes be used to trigger the effect of "Infinity Core" in a pinch. "[[Limiter Removal]]" can double the already-impressive ATK of the "Meklord Emperors" and "Meklord Astros", making it easier to deal enough damage to win the game. Furthermore, the "Meklord Emperors" having the same ATK and DEF means they have some synergy with the "[[Gizmek]]" monsters.

  The archetype's reliance on effect destruction lets them take advantage of cards like "[[Dark Hole]]", "[[Torrential Tribute]]" and especially "[[Interrupted Kaiju Slumber]]", which in addition to destroying all monsters on the field, can Special Summon "[[Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju]]" from the Deck to insulate the player against their opponent's "[[Kaiju]]" monsters and synergize with "Limiter Removal".

  ===Weaknesses===
  * "Meklord" monsters cannot reach their full potential against players who do not depend on Synchro Monsters, especially if they do not have an Extra Deck at all for "Triskelion" to equip from, such as "Domain [[Monarch]]" Decks.
  * "[[Stardust Dragon]]" and "[[Shooting Star Dragon]]" can prevent the archetype's Spells and Traps from destroying their monsters.
  * Anti-Machine cards like "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" or "[[System Down]]" can clear the field of all "Meklord" monsters; the latter is especially damaging as it banishes all monsters in the GY as well, preventing "Triskelion" from Summoning itself.
  * "Meklord Emperor" and "Meklord Astro" monsters can only Summon themselves by their own effects or procedures, so they cannot do anything if they are removed from the field.
  * Although "[[Meklord Emperor Wisel]]" has a powerful effect to negate Spell activations, it prevents the other monsters the player controls from attacking, reducing the archetype's offenses.
