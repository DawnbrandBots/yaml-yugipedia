  '''"Meklord"''', known as '''"Machine Imperial"''' ({{Ruby|機|き}}{{Ruby|皇|こう}} ''Kikō'') in the ''[[OCG]]'' and the English dubbed version of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime until [[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's - Episode 103|episode 103]], are an anti-[[Synchro]] [[archetype]] used by the three main villains of the third arc of the ''5D's'' anime: the [[Three Pure Nobles]] and their combined form, [[Aporia]]. The archetype is split into several groups: "[[Meklord Emperor]]", "[[Meklord Astro]]", and "[[Meklord Army]]". The component pieces of the "Meklord Emperors" are also represented in the "[[Wisel]]", "[[Skiel]]", "[[Granel]]" and "[[Attack (archetype)|Attack]]" archetypes.
  == Appearance ==
  {{Main|Meklord Emperor|Meklord Army}}
  The "Meklord Emperors" and "Meklord Astros" have their colors representing material. "[[Meklord Emperor Wisel|Wisel]]" is silver, "[[Meklord Emperor Skiel|Skiel]]" is sapphire and "[[Meklord Emperor Granel|Granel]]" is gold, "[[Meklord Astro Mekanikle|Mekanikle]]" is platinum, and "[[Meklord Astro Dragon Asterisk|Asterisk]]" is an amalgam of the three previous "Meklord Emperors".
  The first three "Meklord Emperors" have been released as stand-alone cards, albeit with their whole form in a single card instead of 5. They retain their [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] stealing [[effect]], and "Wisel" and "Skiel" are the only [[Monster Card|monsters]] that can [[attack]] whilst on the field. "Granel", though, still allows other monsters to attack. However, instead of having to [[destroy]] a Core monster, they are Summoned when ''any'' monster is destroyed by a card effect, making them highly splashable. Additionally, "Wisel" has the ability to negate [[Spell Card]]s, "Granel" can [[Special Summon]] the Synchro Monsters [[equip]]ped by its effect and "Skiel" is able to attack [[Direct attack|directly]] by [[send]]ing an equipped monster to the [[Graveyard]]. "Meklord Astro Mekanikle", "Meklord Emperor Wisel" and "Meklord Emperor Granel" are ''[[V Jump promotional cards|V Jump Promotional Card]]''. The "[[Meklord Army]]", weaker incarnations of the "Meklord Emperors" used by [[Aporia]], as well as "[[Meklord Astro Dragon Asterisk]]", and other support cards for this archetype were released in ''[[Extreme Victory]]'', alongisde "Meklord Emperor Skiel" in the set's ''TCG'' release.
  == Playing style ==
  The "Meklord" archetype focuses on taking advantage of the opponent's [[Synchro Monster]]s and destroying monsters you [[control]] in order to Special Summon the "Meklord Emperors". All of the monsters of this archetype either have effects that help them in battle or increase their ATK stats, making "Meklords" a [[Beatdown]]-heavy deck. The monsters are technically compatible with almost any [[Main Deck|Deck]] and can therefore be considered Anti-Synchro tech, should one have the need for it. The low [[Level]]s of the "[[Meklord Emperor]]s" allow them to work around Level-restricting [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s. Since the release of ''[[Extreme Victory]]'' there has been a number of support cards added to the game that will help you bring out your "Meklord Emperors", such as "[[Mektimed Blast]]". 
  "Meklords" focus mostly on self-destruction by card effects in order to Special Summon the "Meklord Emperors"; a sizeable number of the "Meklord" monsters also features the Synchro monster stealing effect. While the effect was admirable during times when Synchro Monsters reigned supreme, this approach is rather unpractical in the current day and age; with the added support and archetypes that use [[Fusion Summon|Fusion]] and [[Ritual Summon]] and the creation of the [[Xyz Summon|Xyz]], [[Pendulum Summon|Pendulum]] and [[Link Summon]] mechanics, the effectiveness of the both the "Meklord Emperors" and "[[Meklord Astro Mekanikle]]" is significantly reduced.
  The monster line-up consists of a total of eight monsters, which can be further divided into "[[Meklord Army]]", "[[Meklord Emperor]]" and "[[Meklord Astro]]": "Meklord Emperor Granel" starts out with high ATK values, but loses value over the course of the game. "Meklord Emperor Skiel" has comparatively low ATK values and a very situational effect, which makes it very reliant on the opponent playing Synchros to work. And finally, "Meklord Emperor Wisel" is the most useful with its ability to negate Spell Cards and with decent ATK and DEF values, but is still not sufficiently powerful compared to how difficult it is to summon. The "Meklord Army" have no restictions in regards of summoning and sport battle-related effects: "[[Meklord Army of Granel]]" can halve the ATK of an opponent's monster upon being Normal Summoned, "[[Meklord Army of Wisel]]" can enable [[piercing]] damage, and "[[Meklord Army of Skiel]]" is capable of [[Floater|floating]]. The boss monsters of the "Meklord" archetype take shape in "Meklord Astro Mekanikle", who is basically a 4000 ATK/DEF "Meklord Emperor" with the option of inflicting burn damage, while "Asterisk" can potentially become a enormous beatstick with an in-build penalty for Synchro Summoning. The catch with both these monsters is that they are hugely impractical in terms of summoning and both sport no protection whatsoever.
  The most recent wave of support introduced several cards to increase the consistency of this Deck, including "[[Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core]]", which can [[Special Summon]] "Meklord Emperor" monsters from the Deck and add "Meklord" Spell/Traps to the hand, "[[Meklord Army Deployer Obbligato]]", which can Special Summon "Meklord Army" monsters, and "[[Meklord Assembly]]", which adds "Meklord" monsters to the hand. These not only facilitate the Summoning of the archetype's bigger monsters, but it also allows the use of non-"Meklord" cards to help. "Obbligato" can Special Summon 2 Level 4 "Meklord Army" monsters from the Deck, which can be used to [[Xyz Summon]] "[[Gear Gigant X]]", a monster that can add Level 4 or lower [[Machine]] monsters from the Deck to the hand. Monsters added to the hand with "Gear Gigant X" and "Meklord Assembly" can be Special Summoned with "[[Platinum Gadget]]". In addition, the latter can be destroyed with "Meklord Assembly" to Special Summon a "[[Gadget]]" monster from the Deck.
  In addition, the newest "Meklord Astro" monster, "[[Meklord Astro Dragon Triskelion]]", can be Special Summoned by [[banish]]ing 3 "Meklord" monsters with different names from the [[GY]], and can equip monsters directly from the opponent's [[Extra Deck]], which helps mitigate the archetype's reliance on the opponent's Synchro Monsters. An easy way to bring out this monster only requires "Meklord Army Deployer Obbligato" and either "[[Gold Gadget]]" or "[[Silver Gadget]]". By [[Normal Summon]]ing the "Gadget", it can Special Summon "Obbligato" from the hand, which will destroy itself to Summon 2 "Meklord Army" monsters with different names from the Deck. Next, they can be used to Xyz Summon "Gear Gigant X" to add "Meklord Nucleus Infinity Core" to the hand. Then, by using the "Gadget" monster and "Gear Gigant X", "Platinum Gadget" can be [[Link Summon]]ed, and then be used to Special Summon "Infinity Core" from the hand and add "Meklord Assembly" to the hand. Finally, "Assembly" is used to add "Triskelia" to the hand and destroy "Infinity Core", which can Special Summon any "Meklord Emperor" monster from the Deck, and give the player 3 "Meklord" monsters with different names in the GY to banish and Special Summon "Triskelia".
  While "Meklords" may not be as impressive as some newer archetypes, both their stats and typing can help them shine as well as enable some outsourcing: One can employ "[[Machina Gearframe]]" and "[[Machina Fortress]]" as is common in many Machine Decks. Both "Gearframe" and "Army of Wisel" possess 0 DEF, which makes them an excellent niche for "[[Masked Chameleon]]" enabling both Rank 4 plays and, ironically, Synchro plays. Through "Army of Skiel" one can maintain field presence, which potentially allows for the summon of "[[Gear Gigant X]]" to search for more monsters, although this obviously requires "Army of Skiel" to be destroyed via battle.
  In order to fuel this strategy, cards like "[[Chaos Infinity]]" are recommended. "Chaos Infinity" can combo well with the "Karakuri" monsters and their Battle Position effects. The [[Field Spell]] "[[Fortissimo the Mobile Fortress]]" is a good asset to perform swarming. One use could be to Normal Summon "Army of Granel" and then use the effect of "Fortissimo" ensuring both the weakening of the opponent's monster as well as fueling one's offensive even further. If one decides to play "Fortissimo", putting as many "[[Meklord Army]]" cards as in the deck is paramount. For the more elusive "Meklord Emperors", one can use cards such as "[[Gold Sarcophagus]]" or "[[Where Arf Thou?]]" to add them to the hand. Generic Machine support such as "[[Iron Call]]" or "[[Limiter Removal]]" is also an excellent choice.
  Lastly, due to the "Meklord Emperors" summoning requirement, cards like "[[Dark Hole]]", "[[Torrential Tribute]]" and "[[Interrupted Kaiju Slumber]]" can be ran and used regularly, wiping the opponent's progress while summoning an "Emperor". "Interrupted Kaiju Slumber" allows for "[[Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju]]" to make an appearance, who will grow to an impressive 6600 ATK under the effect of "Limiter Removal".

  ===Weaknesses===
  * A "Meklord" Deck is suited to combat [[Synchro Monster]]s and thus does not work well against players who do not depend on Synchro Monsters.
  * The "Meklord Emperors" have extreme problems when against decks that can return them to the hand, such as "[[Timelord]]" decks or "[[Scrap]]" decks featuring "[[Scrap Twin Dragon]]". Returning enough of the "Emperors" to the hand can result in a hand full of un-usable [[Special Summon Monster]]s without expendable monsters to self-destruct for their summon (though "[[Meklord Astro Mekanikle]]" helps mitigate this scenario).
  * Any of the myriad of anti-Machine mass-removal cards such as "[[System Down]]", "[[Magnetic Mosquito]]" and "[[Acid Rain]]" can be utilized against these monsters.
  * Since all Meklord monsters are Machines, they can be used as [[Fusion Material]]s along with "[[Cyber Dragon]]" to Summon "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" by [[Contact Fusion]].
  * This archetype has trouble building a strong offensive line, since controlling more than one "Meklord Emperor Skiel" or "Meklord Emperor Wisel"– the two strongest [[Level 1 Monster Cards]] and the archetype's best fighters – prevents monsters their owner controls from attacking.
