  {{Quote|A new combat-crazed World Premiere theme...|source=''[[Blazing Vortex]]'' promotional material}}
  "'''War Rock'''", known as "'''Warcry'''"  (ウォークライ ''Wōkurai'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Warrior]] monsters introduced in ''[[Blazing Vortex]]'' (''[[TCG]]'') and ''[[World Premiere Pack 2021]]'' (''OCG'').
  ==Design==
  "War Rock" monsters are based on primitive warriors, adorned in armor and tattoos, some to the point of mimicking animals.
  ==Playing style==
  The "War Rock" archetype focuses on an aggressive playstyle centered around spamming the boards with monsters, battling opponent's monsters, and giving boosts of [[ATK]] to its members until the end of the opponent's turn after successfully [[activating]] their effects, allowing them to build up surprisingly high ATK in a short space of time. This is facilitated by the [[Field Spell]], "[[War Rock Mountain]]", which can [[search]] a "War Rock" monster on activation and [[Special Summon]] a "War Rock" monster from the [[hand]] at the start of the [[Battle Phase]] while also protecting a "War Rock" from being [[destroyed by battle]].
  Also, most "War Rock" monsters include an effect that allows the player to Summon them or another "War Rock" or [[Warrior]] monster to the [[field]] under certain conditions, usually related to battling, destruction, or leaving the field by an opponent's card effect. The [[Level]] 4 monsters, "[[War Rock Fortia]]", "[[War Rock Gactos|Gactos]]", and "[[War Rock Wento|Wento]]", can Special Summon a Level 5 or higher "War Rock" monster from hand or [[Deck]] when sent to the [[GY]] by an opponent's card effect. The Level 5 or higher monsters are able to [[Normal Summon]] themselves without the need of [[Tribute]]s, such as "[[War Rock Orpis]]" and "[[War Rock Mammud|Mammud]]"; the effect of "[[War Rock Skyler]]" can Special Summon a Level 5 or lower "War Rock" monster from the GY, and "[[War Rock Bashileos]]" can Special Summon itself from the hand or GY when an [[EARTH]] Warrior monster is destroyed by battle.
  The only member without a Special Summon effect is "[[War Rock Meteoragon]]", which can considered as the "War Rock" boss monster and the one most cards are focused to Special Summon to the field.
