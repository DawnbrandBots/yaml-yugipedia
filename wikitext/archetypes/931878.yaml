  "'''Gate Guardian'''" (ゲート・ガーディアン ''Gēto Gādian'') is an sub-[[archetype]] of the "[[Guardian]]" archetype, comprising high-[[Level]] monsters based around the original "[[Gate Guardian]]" and its three component cards "[[Sanga of the Thunder]]", "[[Kazejin]]", and "[[Suijin]]". They were used by the [[Paradox Brothers]], [[Para]] and [[Dox]], in the original series and in their appearance in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]''.

  All monsters in the series are a combination of two or all three of "Sanga of the Thunder", "Kazejin", and/or "Suijin", and have an ATK and DEF each equal to half the sum of that of their components.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  "Gate Guardian" is formed from the combination of its three component parts, the elements of thunder, wind, and water, which is represented by the three being stacked on each other to form a new body; however, it is also capable of surviving even if one of these parts is destroyed. "Gate Guardian" with all three components is said to rival "[[Exodia the Forbidden One]]" in power, and according to [[Para]] and [[Dox]] was the second monster after "Exodia" created by [[Maximillion Pegasus]] to require multiple cards to be played at the same time to form.

  In a number of video games, "Gate Guardian" is a [[Ritual Monster]] Summoned using "[[Gate Guardian Ritual]]".

  == Playing style ==
  The playing style of "Gate Guardian" focuses on quickly amassing the three parts of the titular monster into your hand or onto the field as [[Continuous Spell Card]]s as quickly as possible through the various effects of their new support cards. Once all three parts are assembled, the player is able to [[Special Summon]] the primary [[Fusion Monster]] of the theme, "[[Gate Guardians Combined]]", a powerful monster able to negate cards or effects of the opponent that target cards you control thrice per turn. Stronger still is the ability to replace itself when it leaves the field by an opponent's card as this allows "Combined" to Special Summon any [[Level]] 11 or lower "Gate Guardian" monster from Deck or [[Extra Deck]], ignoring their [[Summoning condition]]s.

  The selection can range from the original "[[Gate Guardian]]" to the trio of two-piece "Gate Guardian" Fusion Monsters, each of which can be normally Special Summoned by [[banish]]ing their respective materials you control, that hold their own variety of effects. These range from Searching cards to to Stat Manipulation to even a twice per turn Spell and Trap card negation effect. Even more so that when each two-piece Fusion Monster leaves the field by the opponent's card, you are able to Special Summon either material on the card that is banished. This makes for a theme able to withstand the opponent's attacks and force them to deal with several layers of effects in order to dismantle the cards before them.

  Further supporting this are the various [[support]] cards and their ability to turbo out the creation of the Fusion Monsters. "[[Labyrinth Heavy Tank]]" and "[[Shadow Ghoul of the Labyrinth]]" assist by respectively placing the various material monsters onto the field as Continuous Spells with additional card destruction as well as accessing the theme's [[Field Spell Card]] with further disruption still. The majority of the theme's Spells and Traps share a common effect to be banished from the GY in order to add "Sanga", "Kazejin", or "Suijin" that is banished or from the Deck to the hand while also utilizing their respective main effects that refer to cards and effects used by the Paradox Brothers in Duel Monsters as well as GX.
