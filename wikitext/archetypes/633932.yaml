  {{Quote|Master numeric manipulation!|source=''TCG'' commercial for ''[[Mystic Fighters]]''}}

  "'''Mathmech'''", known as "'''Zanki'''" ({{Ruby|斬|ザン}}{{Ruby|機|キ}} ''Zanki'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Cyberse]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Mystic Fighters]]''. It is comprised of primarily [[Level]] 4 monsters of various [[Attribute]]s that focus on [[Synchro Summon|Synchro]] and [[Xyz Summon]]ing. They are used by [[Yami Kuroda]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures]]'' manga.

  ==Etymology==
  The "Mathmech" archetype is themed around [[wikipedia:Mathematics|mathematics]]. The Japanese names of the "Mathmech" monsters involve puns on mathematical terms.

  The name "Mathmech" is a portmanteau of "mathematics" and "mechanical". The Japanese name for "Mathmech" is ''Zanki'' ({{Ruby|斬|ザン}}{{Ruby|機|キ}}, lit. "cutting machine"), and it is a pun on ''keisanki'' ({{Ruby|計|けい}}{{Ruby|算|さん}}{{Ruby|機|き}}, "calculator").

  The name "Geomathmech" used on the archetype's [[Synchro Monster]]s is a portmanteau of "[[wikipedia:Geometry|geometry]]" and "Mathmech". The Japanese name for "Geomathmech" is ''Enzanki'' ({{Ruby|炎|エン}}{{Ruby|斬|ザン}}{{Ruby|機|キ}}, lit. "flame cutting machine"), and it is a pun on ''enzan'' ({{Ruby|演|えん}}{{Ruby|算|ざん}}, "[[wikipedia:Operation (mathematics)|operation]]"). The character ''en'' ({{Ruby|炎|えん}}, "fire") references their [[FIRE]] Attribute.

  The name "Primathmech" used on the archetype's [[Xyz Monster]]s is a portmanteau of "[[wikipedia:Prime (symbol)#Use in mathematics, statistics, and science|prime]]" and "Mathmech". The Japanese name for "Primathmech" is ''Kaizanki'' ({{Ruby|塊|カイ}}{{Ruby|斬|ザン}}{{Ruby|機|キ}}, lit. "clod cutting machine"), and it is a pun on ''kaizan'' ({{Ruby|改|かい}}{{Ruby|竄|ざん}}, "[[wikipedia:Mathematical fallacy|falsification]]"). The character ''kai'' ({{Ruby|塊|かい}}, "clod") references their [[EARTH]] Attribute.

  ==Design==
  The "Mathmech" monsters resemble humanoid robots armed with various types of swords. The Extra Deck "Mathmech" monsters are the combined forms of the "Mathmech" monsters.

  ===Members===
  ====Main Deck Monsters====
  The archetype's Main Deck members can be divided into three sub-series based on their visual and thematic designs. Each sub-series includes one Tuner monster.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Mathmech" archetype focuses on swarming Level 4 Cyberse monsters in order to perform Synchro, Xyz, and Link Summon plays. Secondarily, the archetype focuses on manipulating monster ATKs, in order to assist in [[OTK]]s using their Synchro boss monster "[[Geomathmech Final Sigma]]".

  The "algebra" sub-series, consisting of "[[Mathmech Sigma|Sigma]]", "[[Mathmech Addition|Addition]]", and "[[Mathmech Subtraction|Subtraction]]", are generic Level 4 Cyberse Special Summon extenders (that also Cyberse-lock the player's Extra Deck Special Summons). "Addition" and "Subtraction" also provide a ±1000 ATK stat modification effect when Special Summoning themselves.

  The "analysis" sub-series, consisting of "[[Mathmech Nabla|Nabla]]", "[[Mathmech Multiplication|Multiplication]]", and "[[Mathmech Division|Division]]", support Extra Deck plays by providing Summoning from Deck ("Nabla"), Summoning from hand and GY ("Division"), or level modulation ("Multiplication"). If they're sent to the GY, they will also trigger a combat-boosting effect, either providing double attack ("Nabla") or double ATK ("Multiplication") to a friendly Cyberse monster in the [[Extra Monster Zone]], or halving a monster's ATK ("Division").

  The "geometry" sub-series provides powerful and varied support effects. "[[Mathmech Diameter|Diameter]]" revives a Level 4 Cyberse monster when Normal Summoned, and grants a "Mathmech" Synchro/Xyz monster summoned using it as a material an omni-negate in the turn it's summoned. "[[Mathmech Circular|Circular]]" is another generic extender, but sends 1 "Mathmech" monster to the GY as cost to Special Summon itself; this can be used to dump the "analysis" monsters for combat boosting effects or later revival, or "Sigma" to immediately Special Summon it with its effect. On the field, "Circular" also searches a "Mathmech" Spell/Trap if a "Mathmech" is summoned.

  The archetype's Extra Deck monsters consist of 2 Synchro Monsters and 2 Xyz Monsters.
  * "[[Geomathmech Magma]]" (Level 8 Synchro) can destroy two cards when it destroys a monster by battle, and can search a "Mathmech" Spell/Trap when it is destroyed.
  * "[[Geomathmech Final Sigma]]" (Level 12 Synchro) becomes unaffected by card effects, except for "Mathmech" cards, while it is the [[Extra Monster Zone]], and also deals double battle damage when it battles a monster. Combine this with the archetype's combat boosting effects, and "Final Sigma" can easily perform an OTK on its own.
  * "[[Primathmech Alembertian]]" (Rank 4 Xyz, 2+ monsters) can search any "Mathmech" card when Xyz Summoned, and can tribute 1 monster to Special Summon any "Mathmech" from hand or GY. It is an important searcher and combo-enabler for almost all of the deck's combos.
  * "[[Primathmech Laplacian]]" (Rank 4 Xyz, 3 monsters) can send up to 3 cards the opponent possesses to the GY when Xyz Summoned (1 each from their hand, S/T zone, and monster zone), and can protect friendly "Mathmech" cards from being destroyed by detaching its materials. It is a formidable board-clearer, and can become a powerful disruption piece if it is summoned with "[[Mathmech Superfactorial]]" in the opponent's turn.

  The archetype's Spells and Traps allow for revival and ATK boosting with "[[Mathmech Equation]]", triggering effects of various "Mathmech" Main Deck monsters with the Equip Spell "[[Mathmech Billionblade Nayuta]]", further ATK boosting and card removal with "[[Mathmech Induction]]", and Spell Speed 2 Extra Deck Summoning through "[[Mathmech Superfactorial]]".
