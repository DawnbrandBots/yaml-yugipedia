  "'''Odd-Eyes'''" (オッドアイズ ''Oddoaizu'') is an archetype composed primarily of [[DARK]] [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 7 [[Dragon]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yuya Sakaki]] and [[Z-ARC]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime, [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|manga]], and the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V The Strongest Duelist Yuya!!]]''. 
  The moniker of "Odd-Eyes" refers to the ''[[wikipedia:Heterochromia iridum|heterochromia iridum]]'' present among the monsters of this archetype, all of which have either a red or yellow right eye and either a green or blue left eye.
  Until [[Link Monster]]s were released, the "Odd-Eyes" archetype was the only archetype capable of using every Summon mechanic without leaving its archetype.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Odd-Eyes archetype have cards that specifically support the "[[Magician]]" and "[[Performapal]]" archetypes (and vice-versa), thus they can be used interchangeably to focus on which aspects of the "Odd-Eyes" arsenal the player wishes to use most. 

  "[[Odd-Eyes Revolution Dragon]]" serves as a highly important card as it can search out the archetype's [[Dragon]] [[Pendulum Monster]]s, or revive Dragon [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]], [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]], [[Xyz Monster]]s after performing a [[Pendulum Summon]] with its high [[Pendulum Scale]] of 12. "[[Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon]]" is a key card in the "Odd-Eyes" strategy, Special Summoning "Odd-Eyes" monsters from the Deck, hand or GY whenever an "Odd-Eyes" card is destroyed. "[[Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]]" can destroy itself to search low ATK but useful Pendulum Monsters. "[[Odd-Eyes Mirage Dragon]]" and "[[Odd-Eyes Persona Dragon]]" both can replace themselves as Pendulum Scales or either protect an "Odd-Eyes" monster, or negate the effects of a monster that was Special Summoned from the Extra Deck. Finally, "[[Odd-Eyes Phantasma Dragon]]" and "[[Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon]]" have battle-oriented effects. "[[Performapal Odd-Eyes Butler]]" is a useful extender.

  For searchers, "[[Sky Iris]]" serves as the archetype's main searcher by destroying any other face-up card the user controls (thus easily proccing "Arc Pendulum Dragon", whilst also protecting cards of the three archetypes while they are in Pendulum Zones. "[[Spiral Flame Strike]]" can add Level 7 "Odd-Eyes" monsters from the Deck or face-up Extra Deck. "[[Performapal Skullcrobat Joker]]" and/or "[[Performapal Monkeyboard]]" can search any needed "Odd-Eyes" and/or "Performapal" monsters. Like most other Pendulum Decks, "[[Duelist Alliance (card)|Duelist Alliance]]" is always a must-have searcher for searching "Odd-Eyes (Arc) Pendulum Dragon".

  The archetype's numerous members and support allows the deck to set up a huge [[Pendulum Summon]] which then provides materials for Summoning Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, Ritual and [[Link Monster]]s.

  For Fusion Monsters, the archetype has "[[Odd-Eyes Fusion]]", "[[Pendulum Fusion]]", "[[Performapal Odd-Eyes Dissolver]]", "[[Performapal Splashmammoth]]", "[[Performapal Trump Girl]]" and "[[Performapal U Go Golem]]" for a [[Fusion Summon]]. Usually, their best monster to Summon is "[[Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon]]" for its easily useable negate and its on-Summon effect to bounce an opponent's monster. Other useful choices include "[[Performapal Odd-Eyes Metal Claw]]", "[[Starving Venemy Dragon]]", "[[Starving Venemy Lethal Dose Dragon]]", "[[Supreme King Dragon Starving Venom]]", "[[Starving Venom Fusion Dragon]]" and "[[Odd-Eyes Venom Dragon]]". As "Odd-Eyes" can run Dragon Synchro and Xyz Monsters in addtition to their Fusion and Pendulum Monsters, they can potentially Summon "[[Supreme King Z-ARC]]" or "[[Odd-Eyes Arcray Dragon]]".

  For Synchro Monsters, the deck's notable Tuners alongside "Odd-Eyes" monsters can access Level 7, 8 and 10 Synchro Monsters including "[[Harmonizing Magician]]" (with another Level 3 or 4 "Pendulum [[Magician]]" monster), "[[Nobledragon Magician]]" (which can Special Summon itself from the hand or GY by lowering an "Odd-Eyes" monster's Level by 3) and "[[Performapal Odd-Eyes Synchron]]" (which can use a card in the Pendulum Zone as a Synchro Material alongside itself). Even though "Nobledragon Magician" can only Synchro Summon Dragon Synchro Monsters, there are still a number of valid choices that synergize well with "Odd-Eyes" archetype For Level 7 choices, the "Odd-Eyes" archetype's own Level 7 "[[Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon]]" is a very good choice to Summon as it can Special Summon a Level 7 monster from the Pendulum Zone for Xyz Summon plays. Other noteworthy choices include "[[Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]" (which can potentially be paired with a suitable Tuner for "[[Odd-Eyes Wing Dragon]]" or "[[Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon]]"), "[[Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing]]" or "[[Ignister Prominence, the Blasting Dracoslayer]]" (for their removal effects that are useable in Pendulum Decks), "[[Borreload Savage Dragon]]" (for its omni-negate if Link Monsters are ran), "[[Bystial Dis Pater]]" (if "Nobledragon" is to be used for a Level 10 Synchro).

  For Xyz Monsters, "Odd-Eyes" decks can naturally facilitate the [[Xyz Summon]] of Rank 7 monsters; their most useful choice to Summon is "[[Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon]]". "Absolute Dragon" can also be destroyed with the last effect of "Sky Iris" or be sent to the GY as material for a [[Link Summon]] to proc its effect to Special Summon an "Odd-Eyes" card from the Extra Deck, easily Special Summoning "Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon". On Turn 2 or later, "Absolute Dragon" can Summon out "[[Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon]]" which can then be used as material to directly Xyz Summon "[[Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon Overlord]]" for an OTK with its three attacks.

  For Ritual Monsters, the "Odd-Eyes" can [[Ritual Summon]] their Ritual Monsters with their [[Ritual Spell Card]] "[[Odd-Eyes Advent]]". "[[Odd-Eyes Gravity Dragon]]" can bounce all of the opponent's Spells and Traps upon its Special Summon that the opponent cannot respond to and passively forces the opponent to pay 500 LP to activate a card or effect. "[[Odd-Eyes Pendulumgraph Dragon]]" passively inflicts 300 damage to the opponent whenever they Special Summon from their Extra Deck and has a Spell negate which moves itself to the Pendulum Zone. While it can also be Pendulum Summoned from the hand, instead of being Ritual Summoned, using its Spell negate effect while the card was Ritual Summoned also Special Summons an "Odd-Eyes" monster from the Extra Deck, allowing the card to switch itself for "Vortex Dragon" to negate yet another card or effect. Afterwards, "Pendulumgraph Dragon" can return itself from the Pendulum Zone to the hand to add/recycle a "[[Ritual Spell Card]]". Another Ritual Spell Card useful is "[[Advanced Ritual Art]]" which can use "Odd-Eyes Arc Pendulum Dragon" as the required [[Normal Monster]]. Other Ritual Dragon Monsters to consider in an "Odd-Eyes" Ritual strategy is "[[Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended]]", a Level 7 with a couple of useful Quick Effects; it can return itself from the field to the hand to negate an opponent's Special Summon, then can be discarded to counter any targeted effects.. It can be "revived" with "Odd-Eyes Advent" to cycle through both of its effects once more.

  === Odd-Eyes Chaos/Odd-Eyes Hieratic===
  This build focuses on using the Summoning effects of "[[Odd-Eyes Saber Dragon]]" and "[[Odd-Eyes Wizard Dragon]] to fill the graveyard with the necessary monsters to Special Summon large "[[Chaos]]" monsters, or to trigger the effects of "[[Hieratic]] monsters to swarm the field with monsters to [[Xyz Summon]]. The build can be split or changed around in several different ways; Pure "Chaos", "Hieratic" centric, or purely DARK focused.
