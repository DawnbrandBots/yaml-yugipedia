  "'''Ghoti'''", spelled "'''Ghotis'''" (ゴーティス ''Gōtisu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Fish]] monsters which first debuted in ''[[Power of the Elements]]''.

  ==Etymology==
  [[wikipedia:Ghoti|Ghoti]] is a proposed alternative spelling of the English word "fish" used in an 1855 letter between two authors, used to highlight the disparity between written and spoken English. It is derived from the "gh" in "tough" (pronounced as an "f" sound), the "o" in "women" (pronounced as an "i" sound), and the "ti" in "nation" (pronounced as a "sh" sound).
  Most "Ghoti" monsters have names that are anagrams of words related to fish in various languages.

  ==Design==
  The "Ghoti" archetype is comprised of even Leveled [[WATER]] [[Fish]] monsters, with the Level 2 monsters all being [[Tuner monster]]s. The archetype's non-Tuner monsters all have 0 DEF, and starting with the Level 4 monster having 1500 ATK, each non-Tuner monster from Levels 4 to 8 has 600 more ATK than the monsters that are 2 Levels below them. 
  Aesthetically, the archetype's monsters seem to be large extraterrestrial lifeforms resembling various types of sea creatures. They appear to swim through outer space akin to the deep ocean.
