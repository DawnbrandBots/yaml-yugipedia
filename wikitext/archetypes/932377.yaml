  What does the hero see through a land of adventures?''|source=''The theme's tagline in promotional material''}}

  '''Adventurer Token''', known as '''Rite of Aramesir''' (アラメシアの儀ぎ, Arameshia no Gi) in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game|OCG]]'', is a [[Series|series]] of cards introduced in [[Deck Build Pack: Grand Creators]]/[[The Grand Creators]]. The cards are focused on supporting the "[[Adventurer Token]]" and cards that mention it.

  ==Design==
  The series is based on the character archetypes typical of a TTRPG—warrior, mage, and the like, with the "[[Adventurer Token]]" being a stand-in for the player's character. Two key Spell Cards, "[[Rite of Aramesir]]" and "[[Fateful Adventure]]", represent the player being summoned (literally so, with the effect of "Rite of Aramesir") to a magical world by "[[Water Enchantress of the Temple]]", to go on an adventure with their party members.

  The remaining cards in the series each represent some aspect of the RPG experience:

  * The Monster Cards represent the player's party members.
  * The Equip Spell Cards represent in-game equips.
  * The Field Spell Cards likely represent the settings the player will encounter throughout the game.
  * The Trap Cards represent the abilities of player's allies.


  ==Playing style==
  The Adventurer Token series revolves around the use of the [[Spell Card]] "[[Rite of Aramesir]]" to Summon an "[[Adventurer Token]]" to the [[Field|field]] at the cost of not being able to activate the effects of monsters on the player's side of the field, except [[Special Summon|Special Summoned]] monsters, for the turn. All monsters in this series have an effect to Special Summon themselves from the hand while the player controls an "Adventurer Token" and each has an effect that benefits the [[Deck]] from setting the theme's [[Trap Card|Trap Cards]] from Deck, to [[Searcher|searching]] and [[Field Spell Card|Field Spell]] placement, to even disruption.

  The theme has three main Equip Spells that all share the same effect to [[Equip|equip]] themselves to an Adventurer Token monster the player controls when sent to the [[Graveyard|GY]] and have effects from gaining [[ATK]], lowering the opponent's ATK, and even bouncing cards. Additionally, there are two Field Spells in the theme that give monsters equipped with their respective Equip Spell a form of protection, an effect to [[Draw a card|draw]] a card or inflict burn damage when the "Adventurer Token" destroys a monster in battle, and a third effect to search "Adventurer Token"-related Field Spells after using its prior effects.

  The main focus of the theme is to activate "Rite of Aramesir" as quickly as possible to get an "Adventurer Token" to the field, Summon the various monsters in the series, equip the [[Token]] with the Equip Spells and activate Field Spells in order to defeat the opponent swiftly. As such, the theme can be run as both a full Deck with engines supporting it or as an engine itself in other themes for extension and additional negates.
