  "'''Drytron'''" (ドライトロン ''Doraitoron'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Machine]] [[Special Summon Monster]]s, focused on [[Ritual Summon]], which debuted in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Genesis Impactors]]''. They received cross-archetype support with "[[Ursarctic]]" in ''[[Burst of Destiny]]''.

  ==Etymology==
  "Drytron" in the original Japanese is likely a portmanteau of "Draco", "light", and "-tron". The word "Meteonis", used in the names of "Drytron" Ritual Spell and Monsters, is a portmanteau of "meteor" and "Draconis", the genitive case of "Draco".

  The kanji names of the "Drytron" non-Ritual monsters use the kanji 「{{Ruby|竜輝巧|ドライトロン}}」 (normally ''ryūkikō''; here read as "Drytron"), which literally means "Dragon Shining Machine"; 「輝巧」 is a play on the homophonous 「機巧」 (''kikō''), meaning "machine" or "mechanism". The kanji names of the "Drytron" Ritual monsters use the partially homophonous kanji 「{{Ruby|竜儀巧|ドライトロン}}」 (normally ''ryūgikō''); 儀 (''gi'') means both "ritual" and "instrument", and is related to both their status as [[Ritual Monster]]s and their visual design based on the [[wikipedia:Quadrant_(instrument)|Quadrant]] astronomical instrument.

  The Simplified Chinese name of "Drytron" is 龙机巧 (lóng jī qiǎo), the Chinese counterpart to 竜機巧 (''ryūkikō'' "Dragon Machine"), the base pun that both Japanese "Drytron" kanji names were referencing. The characters 辉 (huī) and 仪 (yí), counterparts to the Japanese 輝 and 儀, are prefixed in front of the archetype name in their corresponding monster cards. i.e. 辉龙机巧 ("Shining Dragon Machine") for non-Ritual monsters, 仪龙机巧 ("Ritual/Instrument Dragon Machine") for Ritual Monsters.

  Simplified Chinese OCG also translates all cases of "Meteonis" as 降星 (''jiàng xīng''), literally "starfall".

  ==Design==

  The archetype is themed around the [[Wikipedia:Draco (constellation)|constellation of Draco]], with the Main Deck monsters named after its stars (and featuring their namesake highlighted within the constellation in their artwork's background, similarly to the "[[Constellar]]" and "[[Tellarknight]]" monsters), the Ritual Monsters referencing [[Wikipedia:meteor shower|meteor swarms]] with points of origin in the same area, and the full constellation being visible in "[[Meteonis Drytron]]". Most of the Spell/Trap Cards names are named after general stellar phenomena.

  Concept-wise, the archetype introduces a new way of Ritual Summoning, as it considers the ATK of the monsters used for the Ritual Summons instead of their Levels. This makes it possible for the player to use (Machine) Xyz and Link monsters as Tributes, something with no precedent in the game's history. The theme may somehow be related to the "[[Ursarctic]]" archetype, as both of them break the basic rules of their respective central Summoning mechanic, are based on constellations and were introduced in a ''[[Deck Build Pack]]'' in the OCG.

  ==Playing style==

  The "Drytron" archetype revolves around [[Ritual Summon]]ing [[Ritual Monster]]s with their unique archetypal [[Ritual Spell]], "[[Meteonis Drytron]]". "Meteonis Drytron" [[Tribute]]s monsters to reach a target ATK instead of a target Level, while all non-Ritual "Drytron" monsters have a high ATK of 2000 (and a low Level of 1) and the ability to [[Special Summon]] themselves to search for Ritual resources; combining these traits allows high-Level Ritual Monsters to be easily Summoned with just a few "Drytron" Tributes.

  All non-Ritual [[Main Deck]] monsters are [[Nomi]] monsters that must be Special Summoned with a "Drytron" card's effect. They each share the following [[once per turn]] effect to Special Summon themselves, and then performing an additional action to generate card advantage and make it easier to perform Ritual Summons:

  {{Quote|''"You can Tribute 1 other "Drytron" monster or 1 Ritual Monster from your hand or field; Special Summon this card from your hand or GY in Defense Position, then you can [Additional Effect]."''}}

  {| class="wikitable sortable"
  |-
  ! Drytron
  ! Additional effect
  |-
  | [[Drytron Alpha Thuban|Alpha Thuban]]
  | Add 1 [[Ritual Monster]] from your Deck to your hand.
  |-
  | [[Drytron Beta Rastaban|Beta Rastaban]]
  | Return 1 of your banished "Drytron" monsters to the GY.
  |-
  | [[Drytron Gamma Eltanin|Gamma Eltanin]]
  | Special Summon 1 "Drytron" monster with 2000 ATK from your GY, except "Drytron Gamma Eltanin".
  |-
  | [[Drytron Delta Altais|Delta Altais]]
  | Reveal 1 Ritual Monster or 1 Ritual Spell in your hand, and if you do, draw 1 card.
  |-
  | [[Drytron Zeta Aldhibah|Zeta Aldhibah]]
  | Add 1 [[Ritual Spell]] from your Deck to your hand.
  |}

  The two key "Drytron" monsters are "[[Drytron Alpha Thuban]]" and "[[Drytron Zeta Aldhibah]]", which search a Ritual Monster and a Ritual Spell respectively when Special Summoned with their own effects; due to the low levels that "Drytron" monsters have, the best Ritual Spell for "Zeta Aldhibah" to add is "Meteonis Drytron".

  The archetype's Ritual Monsters, "[[Drytron Meteonis Draconids]]" and "[[Drytron Meteonis Quadrantids]]", are powerful monsters with 4000 ATK and strong board wipe effects. Importantly, because "Meteonis Drytron" can Ritual Summon ''any'' Ritual Monster, not just "Drytron" Ritual Monsters, the archetype can be used as an engine to easily Ritual Summon almost all Ritual Monsters in the game.

  All "Drytron" Special Summon effects, including "[[Drytron Nova]]", shares the same restrictive condition that the player cannot Special Summon monsters the turn they activate this effect, except monsters that cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. This condition greatly restricts the kinds of cards "Drytron" can work with; Extra Deck monsters, Ritual Monsters, [[Nomi]] monsters, and [[Special Summon-only monster]]s can still be Special Summoned, the player can still Normal Summon/Set, but the vast majority of Main Deck monsters become unavailable to be Special Summoned.

  "[[Drytron Mu Beta Fafnir]]", the sole "Drytron" Extra Deck monster, is a Rank 1 Xyz monster with three effects. Its first effect allows its Xyz Materials to be used as Tributes for a Ritual Summon; its second effect serves as a consistency booster, setting up the Graveyard with additional "Drytron" monsters which in turn can activate their effects in the GY. Its third effect lets it serve as a Spell/Trap negate alongside a [[Machine]] Ritual Monster, usually the "Drytron" Ritual Monsters.

  The "Drytron" archetype is especially synergistic with the "[[Cyber Angel]]" archetype, primarily due to "[[Cyber Angel Benten]]"; "Benten", if Tributed, can (non-once per turn) add 1 LIGHT Fairy monster from the Deck to the hand, making a "Drytron" Special Summon that tributes "Benten" a +1 in card advantage. The most common target for "Benten" is the powerful Ritual support monster "[[Diviner of the Herald]]", who can in turn send "[[Herald of the Arc Light]]" to search out more Ritual Monsters/Spells.

  The archetype's synergies with the "Cyber Angel" [[Fairy]] monsters (who themselves support other Fairy monsters) means that the deck is often built towards using the "[[Herald]]" monsters as the end boards, i.e. "[[Herald of Ultimateness]]" or "[[Herald of Perfection]]", which are easily Ritual Summoned with "Drytron" monsters and can have lots of Fairy monsters in the hand to discard to activate their effects thanks to the Fairy support.

  ==Trivia==
  * This archetype's cross-support with the "[[Ursarctic]]" archetype released in ''[[Burst of Destiny]]'' references the fact that from the 4th to 2nd millennium BCE, [[wikipedia:Thuban|Thuban]] was the [[wikipedia:pole star|polar star]], while in modern times that distinction is now given to [[wikipedia:Polaris|Polaris]]. Additionally, this archetype shares many similarities with the "Ursarctic" archetype:
  ** Both debuted in a [[Deck Build Pack]].
  ** All of its members are based on the stars of/or a constellation itself.
  ** All of its members are mecha-like in appearance.
