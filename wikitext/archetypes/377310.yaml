  "'''Amorphage'''" (アモルファージ ''Amorufāji'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Dragon]] [[Pendulum Monster]]s that debuted in ''[[Shining Victories]]''. Like the "[[Igknight]]", "[[Majespecter]]", and "[[Dinomist]]" archetypes from the sets before them, they have a connection to the "[[Dracoslayer]]" archetype in terms of lore. Additionally, this archetype is strongly connected to the "[[Dracoverlord]]" archetype in both lore and gameplay.

  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  The "Amorphage" monsters appear as normal animals that are mutating into draconic monstrosities, with the Level 2, 4, and 6 monsters being in the process of transformation and the Level 8 already fully transformed. Each monster bears small eye-like gouges in their bodies, as well as a protrusion that resembles the body of a [[wikipedia:Enterobacteria phage T4|T4 virus]]. This also adorns the staff carried by "[[Vector Pendulum, the Dracoverlord]]", who is also related to the "Dracoslayer" archetype—suggesting that the "Amorphages" are a result, if not ''the'' result, of the "Dragon Alchemy" employed by "Vector Pendulum" to create his minions.

  The [[original ATK and DEF]] of each "Amorphage" monster varies with the stage of their transformation, and often either their ATK or DEF are 0. Monsters whose original body has not lost vital features (e.g. "Envy") have 0 ATK, possibly due to still struggling against their involuntary metamorphosis and only lashing out in self-defense. Monsters with sufficiently functioning draconic bodies (e.g. "Sloth" and the perfected "Goliath") have 0 DEF, signifying that they no longer have control of their new form or its bloodlust.

  The presence of the original form also seems to influence how much ATK the latter type have; - though "Lechery" has a functioning draconic body, it has not yet overtaken the creature's original form, and has somewhat low ATK; conversely, "Sloth" has all but consumed its original body, and has a much high ATK. The stages of transformation also seem to be linked to how reliant on the Pendulum Scales the monsters are - e.g., "Amorphage Sloth" and "Goliath" do not need to be Pendulum Summoned or Flipped face-up in order to prevent both players from Summoning non-"Amorphage" monsters from the Extra Deck. In addition, many of their [[floodgate]] Pendulum effects require monsters as regular Tributes, suggesting that they must continually consume living beings in order to fully transform.

  ===Etymology===
  "Amorphage" is a portmanteau of "amorphous" and "[[wikipedia:Bacteriophage|bacteriophage]]". 

  The ''OCG'' names of the "Amorphage" monsters are derived from Latin or Greek words corresponding to the [[wikipedia:Seven deadly sins#Origin of the currently recognized seven deadly sins|eight evil thoughts]], precursors of the [[wikipedia:Seven deadly sins|seven deadly sins]]; the implication is that both their bodies and their minds have been altered by "Vector Pendulum, the Dracoverlord" into vile and deadly dragons. The ''TCG'' names are instead derived directly from the seven deadly sins.

  ==Playing style==
  Each "Amorphage" Pendulum Monster has a Pendulum Effect and a monster effect, all of which are focused on [[floodgate|floodgating]]. Every "Amorphage" Pendulum Effect only applies while the player controls an "Amorphage" monster, and features a [[maintenance cost]] that requires a monster to be [[Tribute]]d during their controller's Standby Phase, or else they are destroyed.

  Balancing their powerful floodgate Pendulum Effects are their limiting Pendulum Scales, which are either 5 or 3, and thus only allow Pendulum Summons of Level 4 monsters.

  Every "Amorphage" monster effect prevent both players from Special Summoning from the Extra Deck, except for "Amorphage" monsters. For Level 2 and 4 "Amorphage" monsters, the effect only applies if the monster was Pendulum Summoned or flipped face-up. The Level 6 and 8 "Amorphage" monsters do not feature this condition and immediately applies the floodgate if they are summoned.

  The archetype features three supporting Spell/Traps: "[[Amorphous Persona]]", which draws cards when an "Amorphage" monster is tributed, "[[Amorphage Infection]]", which searches when a monster is Tributed, and "[[Amorphage Lysis]]", which replaces a Pendulum Scale when a card in the Pendulum Zone is destroyed. Each of them also provide battle support via stat boosts and debuffs. These cards provide recovery for the Deck's heavy maintenance costs.

  The archetype is connected to a thematically related (but gameplay-wise largely separate) Ritual boss monster "[[Amorphactor Pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord]]". It can be Ritual Summoned by the GY effect of "Amorphous Persona", and has a floodgate effect on the field. Though it interacts with "Amorphous Persona", "Amorphage" otherwise has no synergies with Ritual Monsters and has no way to search out the monster, making it a poor fit for the Deck.

  Externally, the archetype can potentially be mixed with other Pendulum archetypes, primarily the "Dracoslayer" and "Dracoverlord" archetypes, to provide floodgates to their end boards.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Cards that prevent Tributing, such as "[[Fog King]]" and "[[Mask of Restrict]]" can hinder this Deck, as each "Amorphage" monster as a Spell Card requires Tributes to stay in the Pendulum Zone.

  * As all "Amorphage" monsters have either 0 ATK or 0 DEF, "[[Doom Donuts]]" can decimate an established field.

  * All "Amorphage" Pendulum Effects include a stipulation that the controller must also control an "Amorphage" monster. Without that, none of their Pendulum Effects apply, and the Deck's biggest strength is gone. 

  * As any Pendulum-reliant strategy, this Deck is also vulnerable to "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]".

  * As the archetype is solely comprised of Pendulum Monsters with Pendulum Scales of 3 or 5, and contains several non-Level 4 monsters, non-"Amorphage" Pendulum Monsters or other cards to extricate "Amorphage" cards from the Extra Deck must be included in the Deck if the player wishes to retrieve or reuse any non-Level 4 "Amorphage" monsters.

  * The introduction of Link rules and changes to the Pendulum zones makes this archetype very difficult to manage for several reasons:
  ** New Master Rules prohibits the archetype's ability to resummon monsters to fuel the Pendulum scales. Currently the cards that recover Pendulum monsters (E.G. [[Oafdragon Magician]] and [[Amazing Pendulum]]) are archetype-restricted, so bypassing the lack of Link monsters is excessively difficult.
  ** The archetype is reliant on backrow, both for tutoring more Amorphage monsters and to generate tokens for tributing, which means the new Pendulum zones dramatically reduce a potential deck's longevity. As tokens tend to be extremely vulnerable, the standard method for utilizing them is to set a card like [[Scapegoat]] or [[Fires of Doomsday]], then activating that card at the end of your opponent's turn. WIth two backrow slots taken up by your Pendulum scales, and another two taken up by Amorphage Lysis/Infection, this leaves the deck's only backrow slot either dedicated to maintaining the scales or countering your opponent.
  ** The archetype has a built-in summoning restriction, so splashing non-archetype Link monsters is impossible without [[Book of Eclipse]] or [[Skill Drain]] to negate the effects. As Skill Drain is currently Limited and Book of Eclipse has a horrendous drawback, the deck isn't capable of maintaining the Pendulum scales for very long.
