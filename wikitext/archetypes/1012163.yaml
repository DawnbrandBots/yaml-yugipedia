  "'''Skull Guardian'''", known in the Japanese version as "'''Law Guardian'''" (ローガーディアン ''Rō Gādian''), is an [[archetype]] composed by "[[Skull Guardian]]" and its retrained form, "[[Skull Guardian, the Silenforcing Protector]]".

  It was first introduced in ''[[Dark Ceremony Edition]]'', with the release of "Skull Guardian", but would only receive its first support in ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]''. It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Guardian]]" archetype, and it is closely related to the "[[Silenforc]]" archetype.
