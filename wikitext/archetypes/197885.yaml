  "'''Geargia'''" (ギアギア ''Giagia'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that resemble gears, as the archetype name suggests. They focus on [[swarm]] and [[Xyz Summon]] tactics. The first member, "[[Geargiano]]", appeared in ''[[Generation Force]]''; additional members and the archetype's first [[support]] appeared in ''[[Return of the Duelist]]''.

  ==Design==
  The "Geargia" archetype is primarily comprised of Level 3 "[[Geargiano (archetype)|Geargiano]]" monsters and Level 4 "Geargia" monsters. The archetype also features two Extra Deck Xyz Monsters that support the archetype.
  * The "Geargiano" monsters are cartoonified depictions of gearboxes, with gear-formed cartoon eyes and arms. Each of them also makes one of the rock-paper-scissors shapes with one of their hands.
  * The Level 4 "Geargia" monsters take the form of cartoon vehicles, each of which contains one "Geargiano" monster as its "driver".
  ** There are two sub-types of Level 4 "Geargia" monsters; 3 of them have effects that are trigged when they are flipped up, while the other 3 don't. Each sub-type contains one monster driven by one of the three "Geargiano" monsters.
  * The Extra Deck monsters take the form of large humanoid machines made out of cartoon gears, and contain multiple "Geargiano" monsters in them.

  == Playing style ==
  All 8 "Geargia" monsters focus heavily on searching out each other, swarming the field in the process and Summoning Rank 3 and 4 Xyz Monsters, especially their ace cards, "[[Geargiagear Gigant XG]]" and "[[Gear Gigant X]]". Each monster has a different effect to search out cards: "[[Geargiano]]" Special Summons any Level 4 Machine monster from the Graveyard by Tributing itself, meaning that the card can be good to support other archetypes; "[[Geargiano Mk-II]]" can do the same as "Geargiano", but only with "Geargia" monsters, however it can also Special Summon the monster from the hand; "[[Geargiano Mk-III]]" do the same as "Geargiano Mk-II", but only if it is Special Summoned by the effect of a "Geargia" card; "[[Geargiarmor]]" search any "Geargia" from the Deck each time it is flipped face-up and is a solid wall with 1900 DEF; "[[Geargiaccelerator]]" helps to swarm the field, as it can Special Summon itself from your hand and has the bonus effect of adding another Geargia from your Graveyard to your hand when it goes to the Graveyard; "[[Geargiarsenal]]" can Tribute itself to Special Summon any "Geargia" from your Deck and also gains 200 ATK for each "Geargia" you control, even itself; "[[Geargiattacker]]" destroys Spell/Trap Cards on the field, up to the number of "Geargia" monsters you control each time it is flipped face-up. "[[Geargiauger]]" can search any Level 4 EARTH Machine monster from the Deck, except itself, when it is Normal Summoned. But you cannot Special Summon monsters, except Machine monsters, nor declare an attack, for the rest of the turn you use this effect.
  One of the ace cards of the archetype, "Gear Gigant X" supports Machine monsters by allowing the player to add any Level 4 or lower Machine monster from the Deck or Graveyard to the hand. Its effect to Special Summon a Level 3 or lower "Geargia" from the Graveyard when it leaves the field allows the player to easily control the Graveyard. The other ace card "Geargiagear Gigant XG" negates the effects of all face-up cards your opponent currently controls, also your opponent cannot activate cards or effects during either player's Battle Step, while a Machine monster you control attacks or is attacked by detaching 1 Xyz Material. Its other effect to add 1 other "Geargia" card in your Graveyard to your hand when it leaves the field allows the player more Graveyard control.
  The theme-supporting Trap Card "[[Geargiagear]]" Special Summons 2 "Geargiano" monsters from the deck and increase their level by 1 and allowing instant Xyz Summon of Rank 4 Xyz Monsters.

  == Weaknesses ==
  * "Geargia" monsters have low [[ATK]], as even their most powerful cards "[[Gear Gigant X]]", which only has 2300 ATK and "[[Geargiagear Gigant XG]]", which only has 2500 ATK, can be destroyed in battle against popular cards such as "[[Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack]]", "[[Evilswarm Ophion]]" and "[[Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos]]". Using cards that alter monster's ATK, such as "[[Limiter Removal]]" and "[[Forbidden Lance]]" as well as using more powerful support monsters such as "[[Karakuri Shogun mdl 00 "Burei"]]" and "[[Karakuri Steel Shogun mdl 00X "Bureido"]]" can help with battling an opponent's monster(s).
  * "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" and "[[System Down]]" can easily clear the field of "Geargia" and supporting Machine monsters.
  * "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" shuts down all searching within the Deck. It can also negate the Special Summoning of Synchro and Xyz Monsters, which can ruin the win condition of "Geargia". 
  * "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]" and other cards that prevent Special Summoning prevents nearly every "Geargia" monster from using their effects, as well as preventing them from Summoning monsters from their Extra Deck.
  * Since this Deck's strategy relies a lot on "[[Geargiarmor]]", negating its effect to search for a "Geargia" monster and set itself backdown can stop the Deck's momentum completely.
  * Use "[[Prohibition]]" on "[[Geargiarmor]]" or "[[Geargiaccelerator]]" can significantly slow the Deck down, if they haven't had time to set up plays yet. However, your opponent can easily use "[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]" to destroy it.
