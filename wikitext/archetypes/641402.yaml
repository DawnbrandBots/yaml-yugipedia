  "'''Barbaros'''" (Japanese: バルバロス ''Barubarosu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]] 8 [[EARTH]] [[Beast-Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yako Tenma]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! R]]''. It received its first support in ''[[Eternity Code]]''.

  ==Playing style==
  Being so far a small theme, "Barbaros" revolves around "[[King Beast Barbaros]]", which is able to [[Special Summon]] itself and can destroy 2 of the opponent's cards by [[banish]]ing a "Barbaros" card from the field or [[GY]], and "[[Beast King Barbaros]]" which can be [[Normal Summon]]ed  without [[Tribute|Tributing]], but have lower ATK as a result. Alternatively, Tributing 3 monsters to Normal Summon it will allow it to destroy all the opponent's cards at once. By adding [[Machine]] monsters to the [[Deck]], "[[Beast Machine King Barbaros Ür]]" can be [[Summon]]ed; this is the biggest "Barbaros" but it inflicts no damage when it attacks.

  Before "King Beast" was released, the Deck would use "[[Skill Drain]]" to be able to Normal Summon "Beast King Barbaros" at its full 3000 ATK, normally partnered with "[[Fusilier Dragon, the Dual-Mode Beast]]".

  ==Weaknesses==
  * Being made up of high-Level monsters, "[[Gravity Bind]]" can force the player to [[Xyz Summon|Xyz]] or [[Link Summon]] to be able to attack.
  * Cards that prevent Special Summoning such as "[[Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds]]" or "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" can slow the Deck down.
  * "Barbaros" does not contain any in-house cards that allow it to recover well from its monsters getting destroyed or banished.
