  "'''Materiactor'''" is a [[TCG Exclusives|''TCG'' World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] [[monster]]s introduced in ''[[Blazing Vortex]]''.
  Unusually for a World Premiere archetype, the theme debuted with just 2 cards and received no additional support until a year later.
  ==Design==
  ==Playing style==
  The "Materiactor" [[Deck]] is currently focused on amassing [[Level]] 3 monsters to [[Xyz Summon]] their [[ace monster]] "[[Materiactor Gigaboros]]", otherwise their playing is still unclear at this time.
