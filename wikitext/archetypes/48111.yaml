  "'''Ally of Justice'''" ({{Ruby|Ａ・Ｏ・Ｊ|アーリー・オブ・ジャスティス}} ''Ārī Obu Jasutisu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by the [[Ghost]] army, [[Diablo]], in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]''.
  == Duel Terminal story ==
  {{Main|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines#The Alliance of Justice}}
  On this distant star, each tribe or clan fights to ultimately reign supreme. For the longest time, the war just waged on, with no one group holding the advantage. However, this battle that no one thought would ever end was suddenly brought to an abrupt halt, as the "[[Worm]]s", invaders from outer space, suddenly crashed on the planet.
  To combat the invaders, the tribes and clans were forced to form a truce and unite together. The four tribes that were the most powerful forces on the continent form their own organization, "Ally of Justice". Bringing together each of their technologies and crafts, they began to develop anti-Worm weapons.
  == Playing style ==
  "Ally of Justice" monsters are either empowered during the user's Battle Phase when the opponent controls [[LIGHT]] monsters or produce disadvantages for the opponent when playing LIGHT monsters. As an archetype "Ally of Justice" is rather unique, since most archetypes tend to not focus exclusively upon destroying one particular category of opposing monsters.
  The most famous card that "Ally of Justice" has to offer is "[[Ally of Justice Catastor]]": "Catastor" saw years of competitive and casual play as a fantastic [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] option. "Catastor" could deal with many boss monsters from the time, as well as being extremely easy to Summon as a generic Synchro Monster. And even nowadays, it is a fantastic option against many monsters in the game. "[[Ally of Justice Cycle Reader]]" has also had major success as a counter option against "[[Lightsworn]]", "[[Blue-Eyes]]" and more recently "[[Drytron]]" decks, and is also useful due to being a [[Tuner monster]]. "[[Ally of Justice Quarantine]]" is a solid counter option against LIGHT decks since it blocks Special Summoning of monsters with that attribute. "[[Ally of Justice Decisive Armor]]" is the deck's in-house boss, but is effectively a very large beatstick if the opponent has no LIGHT Monsters on the field.
  Within the [[Speed Duel]] format, "[[Ally of Justice Clausolas]]" is the central monster in "[[Spell Proof Armor]]" decks, with "[[Ally of Justice Core Destroyer|Core Destroyer]]" featuring as one of the best removal cards available, where "[[A-to-Z|XYZ]]" is a popular Deck choice and "[[Kaiser Glider]]" is feautured in a majority of Decks with relatively little Monster removal available.
  "[[DNA Transplant]]" can be used to make all opposing monsters to LIGHT to allow "Alliy of Justice" Monsters access to their effects. The deck also synergizes well with "[[Orcust]]" cards, with "[[Orcust Crescendo|Crescendo]]" being able to search any Ally of Justice. "[[Kaiju]]" can also replace an opponent's monster with a LIGHT Monster, although both of these are larger than any unboosted "Ally of Justice". The same can be said of the potentially more disruptive "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" Another recent option to be combined with "Ally of Justice" are the "[[Gizmek]]" cards, with some members being able to be recruited to hand by "[[Sacred Scrolls of the Gizmek Legend]]" while the main Gizmek Monsters don't detract from "Ally of Justice's" power.
  ===Weaknesses===
  * Although "Ally of Justice" are at their best when battling LIGHT monsters they can be countered with cards like "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]", "[[Destiny HERO - Plasma]]" and "[[Forbidden Droplet]]".
  * "[[Acid Rain]]", "[[Magnetic Mosquito]]" and "[[System Down]]" also hurt the deck because they clear the field of all [[Machine]] monsters on the field (especially "[[System Down]]" because it [[Banish|banishes]] them).
  * "Allies of Justice" have a hard time against high stat lines, since they don't necessarily pack a lot of destruction effects and might not even reach high enough with "Limiter Removal" involved. They are also slow to gain momentum.
