  "'''Roland'''" (ローラン ''Rōran'') is a small [[archetype]] consisting of monsters that represent [[wikipedia:Roland|Roland]] from ''[[wikipedia:The Song of Roland|The Song of Roland]]''.

  It contains two "[[Noble Knight]]" monsters, both of them also being [[Infernoble Knight]] monsters: 1 [[Effect Monster]] and 1 [[Synchro Monster]]. It was first introduced in ''[[Structure Deck R: Warriors' Strike]]'', but received its first support in ''[[Rise of the Duelist]]'' with the release of "[[Horn of Olifant]]".
