  {{Quote|[[Yuto]] on the "Phantom Knights"|Phantom Knights will never fall! No matter how many times you destroy them, they will always revive!}}
  "'''The Phantom Knights'''", known as "'''Phantom Knights'''" ({{Ruby|幻影騎士団|ファントム・ナイツ}} ''Fantomu Naitsu'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] and [[Trap Monster]]s used by [[Yuto]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime and manga. It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Phantom Knights]]" archetype.
  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  The monsters visually appear to be ghostly beings, while the [[Trap Monster]]s appear to be animated armor/weapons surrounded by ghostly flames. They use the naming scheme "The Phantom Knights of {adjective} {clothing item/weapon}" in the TCG, or "Phantom Knights {adjective} {clothing item/weapon}" in the OCG, with the namesake item being featured in the artwork of each respective card.
  ===Etymology===
  The adjectives for the monsters appear to be words related to disrepair, disuse, and emptiness; while the adjectives for the Trap Monsters seem to relate to darkness, death, emptiness, and mistake.
  In Japanese, their Kanji reads "{{Ruby|幻|げん}}{{Ruby|影|えい}}{{Ruby|騎|き}}{{Ruby|士|し}}{{Ruby|団|だん}}" (''Gen'ei Kishidan'')

  ==Playing style==
  "The Phantom Knights" monsters involve manipulating their cards while they are in the [[Graveyard]]. Though they have other effects, the Main Deck monsters share a common effect of banishing themselves from the Graveyard in order to search each other/their Spell/Trap Cards out or place each other/their Spell/Trap Cards in the Graveyard. Their Spell and Trap Cards also have effects that can be activated from the Graveyard in order to Special Summon more "The Phantom Knights", including multiple [[Trap Monster]]s. These plays are meant to set up the [[Xyz Summon]] of [[Rank]] 2-4 [[DARK]] [[Xyz Monster]]s, supporting them with stat-increasing and protection effects.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As with most [[DARK]] Decks, "Phantom Knights" Decks are extremely reliant on banishing cards from the Graveyard to activate their effects so banishing them right away ("[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Dimension Shifter]]", "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]") or preventing any banishing from the GY ("[[Artifact Lancea]]", "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" and "[[Necrovalley]]") will shut them down.
  * As the Main Deck monsters have low ATK and rely on [[Special Summon]]ing, cards that punish or restrict Special Summoning, such as "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" or "[[Maxx "C"]]" can slow them down.
  * All of "The Phantom Knights" monsters are [[DARK]] monsters whose effects activate in the Graveyard, so "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]", "[[Abyss Dweller]]", "[[Consecrated Light]]" and "[[Soul Drain]]" will all effectively stop this Deck.
  * As the deck is heavily reliant on monster effects on the field, cards that negate monster effects such as "[[Skill Drain]]" and "[[Mystic Mine]]" will heavily limit the deck's abilities.
