  "'''Superheavy Samurai'''" ({{Ruby|超|ちょう}}{{ruby|重|じゅう}}{{ruby|武|む}}{{ruby|者|しゃ}} ''Chōjūmusha'') is an [[archetype]] comprised mainly of [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Gong Strong]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. They are collectively based on [[wikipedia:Benkei|Benkei]] and miscellaneous details of his life. 

  ==Etymology==
  So far, the Japanese names of the "Superheavy Samurai" monsters in the archetype tend to follow a similar pattern of those of the "[[Karakuri]]", in that they have a "numbered code" after the main name and then a second name in quotation marks; for example, "[[Karakuri Muso mdl 818 "Haipa"]]". These codes are often followed by puns; for example, "[[Superheavy Samurai Swordsman]]" (Japanese name ''Superheavy Samurai Sword-999''), with "kyu" being the Japanese word for "nine" (''kyukyoku'' roughly translates to "ultimate") and "[[Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler]]" (Superheavy Samurai Waka-O2), "ni" being Japanese for "two" and thus allowing one to read it as "oni" ("oni" roughly translating to "devil"). This has been removed from the ''[[TCG]]'' names, as the puns are largely untranslatable.

  ==Playing style==
  The strategy of this Deck focus on building a strong defensive frontline by Synchro Summoning their ace monsters, that are capable of attacking while in Defense Position, in which case their DEF is applied for damage calculation. This ability can also be extended to all other "Superheavy Samurai" monsters by the effect of "[[Superheavy Samurai Big Benkei]]". This odd feature makes them immune to cards like "[[Lightning Storm]]", "[[Mirror Force]]", and "[[Number 101: Silent Honor ARK]]". However in return, they can be particularly be vulnerable to cards like "[[Dark Mirror Force]]", "[[Double Trap Hole]]", etc.

  Regarding their organization within the archetype, there are three basic subsets of monsters:
  * The first one have defensive effects that change their battle position upon being Summoned. Examples include "[[Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler|Blue Brawler]]", "[[Superheavy Samurai Swordsman|Swordsman]]", "[[Superheavy Samurai Magnet|Magnet]]" and "Big Benkei";
  * The second one, the sub-archetype "[[Superheavy Samurai Soul]]", act like Equip Cards, giving additional protection to the equipped monster or increasing its offensiveness. Some of them also have Quick Effects and act like hand Traps, by either [[Superheavy Samurai Soulfire Suit|preventing]] one of its partners from being destroyed during that turn or by [[Superheavy Samurai Soulbuster Gauntlet|doubling]] the DEF of a battling "Superheavy Samurai". They are supported by "[[Superheavy Samurai Wagon]]";
  * A third subset has the most distinctive signature effect of the archetype: the requirement of a Graveyard empty of Spell/Trap Cards in order for them to be Summoned, activate, or apply their effects.

  This peculiar feature paves the way to an all-Monster Card Deck. Despite this restriction, they have means of protecting themselves against many sorts of adversities: "[[Superheavy Samurai Soulshield Wall|Soulshield Wall]]" can send itself to the Graveyard in order to negate an attack directed to the then-equipped monster, but makes its DEF 0; "[[Superheavy Samurai Flutist|Flutist]]" can banish itself from the Graveyard in order to negate and destroy a card whose effect targeted a "Superheavy Samurai", etc.

  The bosses of the archetype are its Synchro Monsters, that can all attack while in Defense Position and have a wide variety of effects, ranging from the [[Superheavy Samurai Swordmaster Musashi|retrieval]] of a Machine monster to the [[Superheavy Samurai Warlord Susanowo|theft]] of Spell/Trap Cards from the opponent's Graveyard. The main Tuners are "[[Superheavy Samurai Battleball]]" and "[[Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter|Trumpeter]]". "Trumpeter" can Special Summon itself, facilitating the Synchro Summons, while the effect of "Battleball" allows its controller to use an opposing monster as Synchro Material; as this effect is powerful on its own, it may be convenient to add "[[Kaiju]]" monsters to a "Superheavy Samurai" Deck, in order to ensure that effect can be effectively used against Decks that are entirely comprised of Pendulum, Xyz, or Link monsters.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * As a Machine-Type Deck, this Deck can be vulnerable to cards such as "[[Acid Rain]]", "[[Electric Virus]]", "[[System Down]]", and "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" (being used as Fusion Materials for that monster's Special Summon).
  ** As a Deck that heavily relies on a single Monster Type, it is also vulnerable to "[[There Can Be Only One]]".
  * As a Deck that relies on using low-ATK monsters, this Deck can be vulnerable to cards such as "[[Deck Devastation Virus]]" and "[[King Tiger Wanghu]]".
  ** "[[Power Filter]]" can also be effective against this Deck's Main Deck monsters, with the notable exception of "[[Superheavy Samurai Wagon]]", as well as a few other minor exceptions. However it is important to note that their monsters can still be Normal Summoned, and that the Deck can still Special Summon monsters from the Extra Deck with more than 1000 ATK, if given the opportunity (although they can rarely Special Summon non-"Superheavy Samurai" monsters, due to their own prevalent Special Summon restrictions).
  * As a Deck that rarely uses Spell/Trap Cards, this Deck can be rendered helpless against cards like "[[First of the Dragons]]" and "[[Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician]]". While "First of the Dragons" can be addressed somewhat with the use of "[[Kaiju]]" monsters and/or "[[Breakthrough Skill]]", the latter monster's effect is not so easily addressed.
  * Since this Deck relies on utilizing Defense Position monsters, cards like "[[Dark Mirror Force]]", "[[Ehren, Lightsworn Monk]]", "[[Red Dragon Archfiend]]", and "[[Number 21: Frozen Lady Justice]]" have effects that work specifically against Defense Position monsters. 
  ** Accordingly, cards like "[[Final Attack Orders]]" and "[[Enemy Controller]]" can also be used to disrupt some of their effects, as well as forcing them to use their weaker ATK stat for battles instead of their higher DEF.
  ** Since this Deck's monsters have effects that allow them to attack by using their high DEF, "[[Skill Drain]]" is very potent against them, forcing them to Summon their monsters in Attack Position and/or remain passive in Defense Position (due to their low ATK), while also preventing them from resolving their other monster effects successfully.
  * "[[Inferno Tempest]]" is particularly lethal against this archetype if successfully pulled off as it can potentially banish the entire deck due to mostly being made of only monsters.
