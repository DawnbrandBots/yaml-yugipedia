  "'''Superheavy Samurai'''" ({{Ruby|超|ちょう}}{{ruby|重|じゅう}}{{ruby|武|む}}{{ruby|者|しゃ}} ''Chōjūmusha'') is an [[archetype]] comprised mainly of [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Gong Strong]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. They are collectively based on [[wikipedia:Benkei|Benkei]] and miscellaneous details of his life. 

  ==Etymology==
  So far, the Japanese names of the "Superheavy Samurai" monsters in the archetype tend to follow a similar pattern of those of the "[[Karakuri]]", in that they have a "numbered code" after the main name and then a second name in quotation marks; for example, "[[Karakuri Muso mdl 818 "Haipa"]]". These codes are often followed by puns; for example, "[[Superheavy Samurai Swordsman]]" (Japanese name ''Superheavy Samurai Sword-999''), with "kyu" being the Japanese word for "nine" (''kyukyoku'' roughly translates to "ultimate") and "[[Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler]]" (Superheavy Samurai Waka-O2), "ni" being Japanese for "two" and thus allowing one to read it as "oni" ("oni" roughly translating to "devil"). This has been removed from the ''[[TCG]]'' names, as the puns are largely untranslatable.

  ==Playing style==
  The strategy of this Deck focus on building a strong defensive frontline by Synchro Summoning their ace monsters, that are capable of attacking while in Defense Position, in which case their DEF is applied for Damage Calculation. This ability can also be extended to all other "Superheavy Samurai" monsters by the effect of "[[Superheavy Samurai Big Benkei]]". This odd feature makes them immune to cards like "[[Mirror Force]]", "[[Number 101: Silent Honor ARK]]", "[[White Aura Whale]]", "[[Eisbahn]]", and "[[Black Garden]]" (this last card in particular can backfire tremendously, as the "Rose Tokens" will be exposed to the massive damage caused by the high DEF of the "Superheavy Samurai" monsters). However, they can potentially be vulnerable to cards like "[[Dark Mirror Force]]", "[[Double Trap Hole]]" etc.

  Regarding their organization within the archetype, there are three basic subsets of monsters:

  * The first one have defensive effects that change their battle position upon being Summoned. Examples include "[[Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler|Blue Brawler]]", "[[Superheavy Samurai Swordsman|Swordsman]]", "[[Superheavy Samurai Magnet|Magnet]]" and "Big Benkei";

  * The second one, the sub-archetype "[[Superheavy Samurai Soul]]", act like Equip Cards, giving additional protection to the equipped monster or increasing its offensiveness. Some of them also have Quick Effects and act like hand Traps, by either [[Superheavy Samurai Soulfire Suit|preventing]] one of its partners from being destroyed during that turn or by [[Superheavy Samurai Soulbuster Gauntlet|doubling]] the DEF of a battling "Superheavy Samurai". They are supported by "[[Superheavy Samurai Wagon]]";

  * A third subset has the most distinctive signature effect of the archetype: the requirement of a Graveyard empty of Spell/Trap cards in order for them to be Summoned, activate or apply their effects.

  This peculiar feature paves the way to an all-Monster Card Deck. Despite this restriction, they have means of protecting themselves against many sorts of adversities: "[[Superheavy Samurai Soulshield Wall|Soulshield Wall]]" can send itself to the Graveyard in order to negate an attack directed to the then-equipped monster, but makes its DEF 0; "[[Superheavy Samurai Flutist|Flutist]]" can banish itself from the Graveyard in order to negate and destroy a card whose effect targeted a "Superheavy Samurai", etc.

  There are also two "Superheavy Samurai" [[Pendulum Monster]]s, namely "[[Superheavy Samurai General Jade|General Jade]]" and "[[Superheavy Samurai General Coral|General Coral]]". With Pendulum Effects that either manipulate the Level of a "Superheavy Samurai", in order to set up a Synchro/Xyz Summon, or that allows one of them to attack again, after destroying a monster by battle. Their Monster Effects either reaffirm the defensive-offensive tatics of the Archetype or provide access to resources by trading Tributes for draws.

  The bosses of the archetype are its Synchro Monsters, that can all attack while in Defense Position and have a wide variety of effects, ranging from the [[Superheavy Samurai Swordmaster Musashi|retrieval]] of a Machine monster to the [[Superheavy Samurai Warlord Susanowo|theft]] of Spell/Trap cards from the opponent's Graveyard. The main Tuners are "[[Superheavy Samurai Battleball]]" and "[[Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter|Trumpeter]]". "Trumpeter" can Special Summon itself, facilitating the Synchro Summons, while the effect of "Battleball" allows its controller to use an opposing monster as Synchro Material; as this effect is powerful on its own, it may be convenient to add "[[Kaiju]]" monsters to a "Superheavy Samurai" Deck, in order to ensure that effect can be effectively used against Decks that are entirely comprised of Pendulum, Xyz or Link monsters.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Because the Deck is entirely reliant on Monster cards only, negating Special Summons and Monster Effects can completely shut down the deck. In particular, "[[Mystic Mine]]" will likely leave the "Superheavy Samurai" player with no out, and may be a one-card win.

  * The Pendulum Effect of "[[Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician]]" can completely shut down a dedicated "Superheavy Samurai" Deck, if it doesn't run any Spell/Trap Cards; in such scenario, with no set cards on the Spell/Trap Card Zones, "Superheavy Samurai" monsters on the field will be unable from activating their effects and attacking.

  * Since the archetype focuses on defense, cards like "[[Dark Mirror Force]]", "[[Ehren, Lightsworn Monk]]", "[[Red Dragon Archfiend]]", "[[Chaos King Archfiend]]", and "[[Number 21: Frozen Lady Justice]]", that have effects to deal with Defense Position monsters work well. 

  * "[[Battle Mania]]" and "[[Enemy Controller]]" can also be effective, as they force the monsters into Attack Position, allowing them to be destroyed more easily. 

  * This archetype can have a hard time dealing with "[[First of the Dragons]]", since monster effects don't affect it and Effect Monsters cannot destroy it by battle. This monster alone can easily slow down this Deck. However, it can be destroyed by using your opponent's Spell/Trap cards with "[[Superheavy Samurai Warlord Susanowo]]", or by using "[[Breakthrough Skill]]" to negate its effects.

  * The archetype itself is rather restrictive in terms of adding cards outside it to the Deck. In addition, some of their cards limit the player to only summoning other "Superheavy Samurai" monsters for the rest of the turn, including the primary Tuner "Trumpeter". As a result, it can sometimes be difficult to summon non-"Superheavy Samurai" Extra Deck monsters.
