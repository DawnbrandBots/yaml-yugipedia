  "'''Kashtira'''", known as "'''Kshatrira'''" (クシャトリラ ''Kushatorira'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of primarily [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 7 [[Psychic]] monsters introduced in ''[[Darkwing Blast]]''.

  ==Etymology==
  "Kshatrira" appears to be a portmanteau of [[wikipedia:Kshatriya|Kshatriya]] and ''ira'' (Latin for "anger"). The 3 Main Deck members introduced in "Darkwing Blast" are named after mythological creatures.

  ==Design==
  All members (and their structures, as depicted in "[[Kashtira Birth]]") have a primarily red and black color scheme, with purple accents on the Main Deck monsters. Their own art as well as related Spells and Traps depict them as alien invaders onto "[[Primitive Planet Reichphobia]]", taking resources away in canisters (manifested in gameplay as banishing face-down).

  ==Playing style==

  "Kashtira" is an archetype focused around primarily [[Level]] 7 [[Psychic]] monsters and [[Banish|banishing]] cards face-down. Most members of the archetype, excluding "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]", are Level 7 monsters able to [[Special Summon]] themselves if the player controls no monsters or by some other condition, such as with "[[Scareclaw Kashtira]]" and "[[Tearlaments Kashtira]]", are able to search cards while on the field, and can banish their opponent's cards (from various different locations) if they attack or if the opponent activates a monster effect. This banish playstyle is further emphasized through their original boss monster "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]", a Rank 7 [[Xyz Monster]] with 0 ATK able to Special Summon more Kashtira monsters to the field and lockdown unused [[Main Monster Zone]]s as well as [[Spell & Trap Zone]]s each time an opponent's card in their possession is banished.

  This Playing style would be further enhanced through the introduction of "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]", a Level 4 [[FIRE]] [[Warrior]] monster able to banish a "Kashtira" card from your Deck to banish the top 3 cards of the opponent's Deck, face-down, and become Level 7 itself for use in [[Xyz Summon]]s. Their new offensive force is the Rank 7 "[[Kashtira Arise-Heart]]", a 3000 ATK monster able to be quickly Xyz Summoned once per turn using any 1 "Kashtira" monster on the field the same turn that "Shangri-Ira" used its effect and able to force any cards send to the GY to be banished instead as well as granting itself more materials to use 3 materials and banish any card on the field, face-down.

  "Kashtira" Spell/Trap cards focus on summoning additional "Kashtira" monsters, and either banishing opponents' cards if the opponent activates a card of the same type, or activating an effect when they're banished themselves.
