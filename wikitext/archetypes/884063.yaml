  "'''Kashtira'''", known as "'''Kshatrira'''" (クシャトリラ ''Kushatorira'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of primarily [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 7 [[Psychic]] monsters introduced in ''[[Darkwing Blast]]''.

  ==Etymology==
  "Kshatrira" appears to be a portmanteau of [[wikipedia:Kshatriya|Kshatriya]] and ''ira'' (Latin for "anger"). The 3 Main Deck members introduced in "Darkwing Blast" are named after mythological creatures.

  ==Design==
  All members (and their structures, as depicted in "[[Kashtira Birth]]") have a primarily red and black color scheme, with purple accents on the Main Deck monsters. Their own art as well as related Spells and Traps depict them as alien invaders onto "[[Primitive Planet Reichphobia]]", taking resources away in canisters (manifested in gameplay as banishing face-down).

  ==Playing style==

  "Kashtira" is an archetype based around Level 7 monsters and banishing opposing cards face-down. Each member of the archetype is a Level 7 monster that can Special Summon itself if the player controls no monsters, can search cards on the field, and can banish opposing cards (from multiple different locations) if they attack or if the opponent activates a monster effect.

  "Kashtira" Spell/Trap cards focus on summoning additional "Kashtira" monsters, and either banishing opponents' cards if the opponent activates a card of the same type, or activating an effect when they're banished themselves.
