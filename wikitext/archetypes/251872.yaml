  "'''CXyz'''", which is an abbreviation of "'''Chaos Xyz'''" ({{Ruby|ＣＸ|カオスエクシーズ}} ''Kaosu Ekushīzu''), is an [[archetype]] of [[Xyz Monster]]s with various [[Attribute]]s (primarily [[DARK]], [[EARTH]], and [[LIGHT]]) and [[Type]]s (primarily [[Fairy]] and [[Warrior]]), as well as a sub-archetype of the "[[C (archetype)|C]]", "[[Chaos]]" and "[[Xyz (archetype)|Xyz]]" archetypes, that can be [[Xyz Summon]]ed with [[Xyz Evolution#Chaos Xyz Evolution|Chaos Xyz Evolution]] via the [[card effect|effect]] of "[[Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force]]". They were used in the anime by [[Tori Meadows]], [[Fender]], [[Devon Knox]], [[Carlyle Chesterton]], [[Art Stanley]], [[Lotus Hanazoe]], [[Brooke Walker]], and [[Reginald Kastle|Nash]]. In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL]]'', [[Yuma Tsukumo (D Team)|Yuma Tsukumo]] also uses these cards.

  Additionally, "[[CXyz Barian Hope]]" is a "CXyz" monster without a non-"CXyz" counterpart.

  ==Story==
  "CXyz" monsters are created by the [[Barian]]s for the sole purpose of subduing the "[[Number]]" [[Monster Card|monsters]]. [[Xyz Material|Overlay Unit]]s [[attach]]ed to "CXyz" monsters take the form of red diamond shaped crystals as opposed to glowing orbs, and are referred as "Chaos Overlay Units" rather than "Overlay Units" in the anime.<ref name="e76">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|76|ref}}</ref>

  Like monsters that can utilize [[Chaos Xyz Evolution]], these monsters require an additional Xyz Material but with 1 higher [[Level]] in a regular [[Xyz Summon]], since they themselves are 1 [[Rank]] higher than their respective original counterparts. 

  So far, all of the "CXyz" monsters, except "[[CXyz Simon the Great Moral Leader]]", "[[CXyz Zubaba Saikyo General]]", and "[[CXyz Barian Hope]]", can inflict [[effect damage]] and all "CXyz" monsters, except "[[CXyz Mechquipped Djinn Angeneral]]" and "[[CXyz Dark Fairy Cheer Girl]]", have the same Attribute as their base forms. Visually, they are all tied together by the presence of glowing red energy on their bodies, energy from the [[Barian World]].

  ==Trivia==
  * This archetype can be compared to the "[[Meklord Emperor]]" archetype. Both were specifically used to stop and restrain the key monsters of the protagonists of an anime series ("[[Number]]" monsters in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' and [[Synchro Monster]]s in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' respectively), with the former having a special [[card effect|effect]] (when Summoned via their [[Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force (anime)|signature card]]<!--for emphasis, linking the one that says "CXyz" on its lore-->) to counter the unique anime effect of the "Numbers" that prevents them from being destroyed by battle by non "Number" monsters. In addition, both can absorb specific targets to leave their opponents defenseless, with "Meklord Emperors" being able to equip Synchro Monsters to themselves (removing them from the field while bypassing any [[destroy|destruction]] protection) and "CXyz" monsters being able to [[detach]] Xyz Materials from opposing "Numbers" and [[attach]] them to themselves, crippling their opponents' effects.
  * The scrapped "[[SXyz]]" monsters would have been the direct enemies of the "CXyz" archetype, as they would  have used ''Shining'' Xyz Evolution as opposed to the ''Chaos'' Xyz Evolution, had they ever appeared.
