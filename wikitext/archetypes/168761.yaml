  "'''Masked HERO'''" ({{Ruby|Ｍ・ＨＥＲＯ|マスクドヒーロー}} ''Masukudo Hīrō'' in Japan, written as {{Ruby|Ｍ|マスクド}}・{{Ruby|ＨＥＲＯ|ヒーロー}} or {{Ruby|Ｍ|マスクド}}・{{Ruby|Ｈ|ヒーロー}} in the Japanese manga) is a "[[HERO]]" sub-[[archetype]] used by [[Jaden Yuki (manga)|Jaden Yuki]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (manga)|''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' manga]]. Jaden started using this archetype after the tournament to [[Duel]] the [[Zane Truesdale (manga)|Kaiser]], when he decided to build an "all-his Deck", which would eventually grow into his ultimate Deck (since the "[[Elemental HERO]]" monsters he used previously were from [[Koyo Hibiki]]'s Deck).

  The [[Transformation Summon]] method is utilized by this archetype.

  ==Design==
  While the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype is said to be based off of American superheroes, it can also be assumed that the "Masked HERO" archetype is a salute to Japanese ''[[wikipedia:Kamen Rider|Kamen Rider]]'' heroes. In addition to "Kamen" meaning "Masked", there are several similarities between the two, such the recurring "form changing" and transformations of Kamen Riders. The Double Attacks are also similar to the original Kamen Riders' (1 and 2) "Rider Double" techniques.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Masked HERO" archetype centers on the "[[Change]]" [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s", mainly "[[Mask Change]]" and "[[Mask Change II]]", which can "transform" a monster into a "Masked HERO" Fusion Monster, sending the monster on the field to the Graveyard and [[Special Summon]]ing the "Masked HERO" from the [[Extra Deck]] (rather than [[Fusion Summon]]ing like most [[Fusion Monster]]s do).

  In the manga, "Masked HERO" is an independent archetype featuring its own Main Deck monsters. In the ''[[TCG]]''/''[[OCG]]'' however, they do not have any Main Deck monsters, and "[[Mask Change]]", which only worked on "Masked HERO" Main Deck monsters in the manga, was revamped to be a general "[[HERO]]" support. Due to lacking Main Deck monsters, the archetype has no de facto "playing style", and instead primarily served as boss monsters for other "HERO" decks, such as "[[Elemental HERO]]" or "[[Destiny HERO]]" decks, or even a cross-archetypal "HERO" archetypal deck. The most important support for the archetype's monsters is "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]", who can search out "Change" Spells when Special Summoned.

  "[[Mask Change II]]" takes the splashability of "Masked HERO" monsters one step further, by allowing any monster to "transform" into a "Masked HERO" monster.
