  "'''Horus'''" (ホルス ''Horusu'') is an [[archetype]] first introduced in ''[[Soul of the Duelist]]'', and that received its first support in ''[[Age of Overlord]]''. It's primally consisted of two groups: the "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon]]" sub-archetype and monsters related to it, and a set of [[Level 8 Monster Cards|Level 8 monsters]] that support "[[King's Sarcophagus]]".

  == Design ==
  === Members ===
  "Horus" monsters can be divided into two sub-series: "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8]]" and its associated cards, and monsters based on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_sons_of_Horus four sons of Horus] related to "[[King's Sarcophagus]]".
