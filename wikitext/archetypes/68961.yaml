  "'''Toy'''" (トイ ''Toi'') is an [[archetype]] of cards that resemble [[wikipedia:toy soldier|toy soldier]]s and other figures. They are mainly used by [[Yugi Muto]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! R]]'' and [[Jean-Louis Bonaparte]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]''.

  In the ''OCG''/''TCG'', they are supported by "[[Toy Box]]", which in its card effect specifies "Toy" monsters that can be played in the Spell/Trap Zones under their own effects. This phrasing is likely in order to specifically exclude cards that incidentally include 「トイ」 in their Japanese names, such as "[[Clock Spartoi]]", as well as "Toy" spells unrelated to Yugi's deck.

  Despite the "[[Frightfur]]" archetype being known as "Death-Toy" in Japan, it is not a sub-archetype of this archetype, as it uses an alternative spelling of "Toy", 「トーイ」.

  ==Design==
  Cards that intentionally have "Toy" in their name can be broken up into multiple different sub-groups used by various characters across the franchise. They are loosely united by visually featuring dolls, figurines and other playthings, often of military or combat units, as well as the characters which use them often having some thematic relationship to childhood.

  ===Yugi Muto===
  Yugi's "Toy" monsters have various [[type]]s, and are associated with his [[Toy Box]] Spell Card. They can be played as backrow without being [[Pendulum Monster]]s, with special effects when destroyed from this position. They may represent his child-like innocence when compared to his alter ego, [[Yami Yugi]].

  ===Alister===
  [[Alister]], from the ''[[Waking the Dragons]]'' anime-exclusive arc of the original ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' series, uses a card called [[Toy Robot Box]] (unreleased in the physical card game). It generates [[Token Monster]]s that resemble the favorite action figure of his lost younger brother, the memory of whom serves as his motivation.

  ===Jean-Louis Bonaparte===
  The vice-chancellor of [[Duel Academy]] uses his own version of a "Toy" deck, including [[Warrior]]-type monsters based on Napoleonic warfare. They have a variety of basic effects, but have not been released in the physical card game, though they do appear in some video games. Besides reinforcing his connection to his namesake, they may allude to his command role at the school, and his desire to be closer to his son. 

  ===Sora Perse===
  [[Sora Perse]] from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' uses Spell Cards that have the relevant spelling of "Toy" in their name, such as "[[Toy Vendor]]". They complement his "[[Fluffal]]"/"[[Edge Imp]]"/"[[Frightfur]]" deck, themed around possessed weaponry which corrupts sentient animal plushies, which parallels Sora's own deceptive false innocence in his anime debut.

  ==Playing style==
  Only Yugi and Sora have had at least some of their "Toy" cards released into the ''OCG/TCG''. Yugi's monsters have the gimmick of being non-Pendulums able to be placed in the Spell/Trap Zones and then being summoned when destroyed, and have other generally helpful effects, but lack an in-archetype boss monster. Sora's "Toy" Spell Cards merely serve to support his "Frightfur"-based playing style.

  ==Trivia==
  *There are two different versions of "Toy Soldier", one associated with Yugi and one with Jean-Louis.
