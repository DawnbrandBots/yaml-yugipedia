  "'''Legendary Dragon'''" ({{Ruby|伝|でん}}{{ruby|説|せつ}}の{{Ruby|竜|りゅう}} ''Densetsu no Ryū'') is an [[archetype]] of the dragon forms of the three "[[Legendary Knight]]" monsters. The archetype was introduced in ''[[Dragons of Legend]]'' and was featured in the [[Waking the Dragons]] arc of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime.
  Despite all of the members of this archetype lacking "Legendary Dragon" in their names, they each include a [[name condition]] that causes them to always be treated as "Legendary Dragon" cards.
  The names of the "Legendary Dragons" come from the ancient philosopher [[wikipedia:Plato|Plato]]'s workings. The specific body part in the name corresponds to where they were stabbed and sealed during the war in the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime.
  "[[Legendary Dragon of White]]" is not a "Legendary Dragon" card because it does not have 「{{Ruby|伝説|でんせつ}}の{{Ruby|竜|りゅう}}」 in its Japanese name.
  ==History==
  These cards first appeared in the [[Waking the Dragons]] arc of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime.
  [[Yugi Muto]], [[Joey Wheeler]] and [[Seto Kaiba]] each receive 1 of the 3 Legendary Dragon cards: "[[The Eye of Timaeus]]", "[[The Claw of Hermos]]" and "[[The Fang of Critias]]", respectively. According to Kaiba, the Dragon he received, "Critias", seemed just as powerful as the [[Egyptian God Card]]s.
  These cards are the dragon forms of the three "[[Legendary Knight]]s" who used to live in the [[Dominion of the Beasts]] and answered [[Ironheart]]'s call to defend [[Atlantis]]. [[Dartz]] transformed them into dragons to weaken them. The great ancient war ended in a draw, with the Dragons sealed away in their realm and the Leviathan severely weakened and diminished to a shadow.
  Although their names are known prior to their release in the dub anime, in the original anime, no one—not even the monsters—knows the names of these dragons except for their chosen Duelists, who learn their name upon releasing them, without even being told what their names are. Thus, they are referred to as the Nameless Dragons in the Japanese anime sometimes even by their chosen Duelists.
  ===Properties===
  [[File:Legendary Dragons in Monster Card Zones.jpg|thumb|The Legendary Dragons being played in [[Monster Card Zone]]s in the anime]]
  In the anime, they do not belong to any regular card type; their cards are colored blueish, but not the same as [[Ritual Monster]]s. They can be played whilst "[[Spell Canceller (anime)|Spell Canceller]]" is on the [[field]], so are not [[Spell Card]]s unlike in the ''TCG''/''OCG''. They are usually played in [[Monster Card Zone]]s, but [[Yami Yugi]] placed "[[Eye of Timaeus]]" in a [[Spell & Trap Card Zone]] during his Duel with [[Weevil Underwood]].
  "[[Eye of Timaeus]]" can fuse with other [[monster]]s to become new [[Fusion Monsters]]. [[Yami Yugi]] fused this card with "[[Dark Magician (anime)|Dark Magician]]" and "[[Dark Magician Girl (anime)|Dark Magician Girl]]" to form the respective [[Fusion Monsters]]: "[[Amulet Dragon (anime)|Amulet Dragon]]" and "[[Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight (anime)|Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight]]". He once attempted to fuse it with "[[Poison Butterfly]]" but it did not work as at this point Yami Yugi had lost Timaeus' trust, because he played "[[The Seal of Orichalcos (anime)|The Seal of Orichalcos]]".
  The "[[Claw of Hermos]]" can fuse with other monsters to form new [[Equip Spell Card|Equip Spells]]. [[Joey Wheeler|Joey]] fused this card with "[[Time Wizard (anime)|Time Wizard]]", "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon (anime)|Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]", "[[Rocket Warrior (anime)|Rocket Warrior]]" and "[[Big Bang Blow]]" to make the respective [[Equip Spell Card|Equip Spells]]: "[[Time Magic Hammer]]", "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword]]", "[[Rocket Hermos Cannon]]" and "[[Big Bang Dragon Blow]]". In addition, [[Yami Yugi]] also fused "[[Queen's Knight (anime)|Queen's Knight]]" with this card to form "[[Goddess Bow]]".
  The "[[Fang of Critias]]" can fuse with [[Trap Card|Traps]] to form new [[Fusion Monsters]] with [[card effect|effects]] similar to the Trap Card. [[Seto Kaiba]] fused this card with "[[Crush Card]]", "[[Tyrant Wing (anime)|Tyrant Wing]]" and "[[Mirror Force (anime)|Mirror Force]]" to form the respective [[Fusion Monsters]]: "[[Doom Virus Dragon (anime)|Doom Virus Dragon]]", "[[Tyrant Burst Dragon (anime)|Tyrant Burst Dragon]]" and "[[Mirror Force Dragon (anime)|Mirror Force Dragon]]".
  "[[Legend of Heart]]" allows them to transform into their [[Legendary Knight]] forms: "[[Legendary Knight Timaeus (anime)|Legendary Knight Timaeus]]", "[[Legendary Knight Hermos (anime)|Legendary Knight Hermos]]" and "[[Legendary Knight Critias (anime)|Legendary Knight Critias]]". These three Legendary Knights, under the right conditions, can also be combined to form "[[Timaeus the Knight of Destiny (anime)|Timaeus the Knight of Destiny]]".

  In addition to the [[Spell Card]] "[[The Eye of Timaeus]]", [[Timaeus]] also possesses a [[Monster card|monster]] form based on his [[Dragon]] appearance: "[[Timaeus the United Dragon]]".
  ===Legendary Knight===
  {{main|Legendary Knight}}
  These are the true forms of the "Legendary Dragons". These knights were weakened by [[Dartz]] and were transformed into [[Dragon]]s, but they were eventually freed. Under the right circumstances, the three can combine to form "[[Timaeus the Knight of Destiny]]".

  In addition to [[Fusion Monster]]s formed using one of the "Legendary Dragon" cards and another card, "[[Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon]]" was originally formed with "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]" and "[[Tyrant Burst Dragon]]".
  ==Playing style==
  Each of the "Legendary Dragons" can [[Special Summon]] one of a number of [[Fusion Monster]]s by using another card. In the ''[[TCG]]''/''[[OCG]]'', only "[[The Eye of Timaeus]]" uses the other card as a [[Fusion Material]]; "[[The Fang of Critias]]" and "[[The Claw of Hermos]]" instead send the card to the Graveyard.
