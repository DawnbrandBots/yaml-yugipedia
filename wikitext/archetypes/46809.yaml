  "'''/Assault Mode'''", known as "'''/Buster'''" ({{Ruby|／|スラッシュ}}バスター ''Surasshu Basutā'', read as "Slash Buster") in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Effect Monster]]s that are powered-up versions of already-existing [[Synchro Monster]]s, which are [[Special Summon]]ed by using "[[Assault Mode Activate]]", "[[Assault Mode Zero]]" or "[[Assault Reboot]]" on the corresponding Synchro Monsters. Those versions have the same name as its counterpart, but with "/Assault Mode" at the end.

  This archetype was localized to "/Assault Mode" in order to convey a greater sense of power, according to Dan Scheidegger (an Upper Deck Entertainment employee) in a post on Pojo<ref>http://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?p=11236784#post11236784</ref>.
  In the anime tour special episode, ''[[Evolving Duel! Stardust VS Red Demons]]'', [[Yusei Fudo]] and [[Jack Atlas]] had a Duel in which they both Summoned "/Assault Modes" of their [[Five Dragons|dragons]]. Jack summoned "[[Red Dragon Archfiend/Assault Mode]]" first and began to boast about it but Yusei quickly brought out "Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode". A lot of the Duel consisted of both players using various cards to protect their dragon and take out their opponent's. Eventually, both "/Assault Modes" were destroyed and the regular "[[Red Dragon Archfiend]]" and "[[Stardust Dragon]]" returned. Yusei increased the ATK of "Stardust Dragon" so it could defeat "Red Dragon Archfiend" and used "[[Synchro Destructor]]" to take out Jack's remaining [[Life Points]].
  ==Design==
  Aesthetically, the "/Assault Mode" monsters are re-armored [[counterpart]]s of the original monster. Certain small details other than "armor" change in the monsters design when they are transformed into their "/Assault Mode" forms but the overall design of the original is kept intact.

  In terms of stats, each monster has 500 more [[Original ATK and DEF|ATK and DEF]] than their original versions, their [[Level]] is 2 higher (except "[[T.G. Halberd Cannon/Assault Mode]]", as its original is already at the maximum Level of 12), and they Special Summon their original versions when they are destroyed. In addition, each monster has a more powerful version of their originals' [[Monster effect|effects]].

  ==Playing style==
  "/Assault Mode" monsters are powerful, but they are [[Main Deck]] monsters that rely on [[Special Summon]]ing their original counterparts quickly and consistently, making them potential bricks in the hand. Furthermore, "[[Assault Mode Activate]]" can only Special Summon monsters from the Deck, while "[[Assault Mode Zero]]" can only Special Summon from the hand; having the wrong card depending on where the desired monster is can be an issue. On occasion, an "/Assault Mode" monster's effect may not be as desirable as the original ("[[Hyper Psychic Blaster/Assault Mode]]" does less damage with its effect, generally, than its original version's piercing damage, but will activate when attacking an [[Attack Position]] monster, and "Red Dragon Archfiend/Assault Mode" destroys all other monsters the player controls).

  "[[Psi-Reflector]]" is key to the Deck's success, since it can search any card that mentions "Assault Mode Activate", and then Special Summon a [[Non-Tuner monster]] that mentions it from the GY and change its [[Level]] as needed to enable a [[Synchro Summon]] of the desired [[Synchro Monster]]. "[[Assault Beast]]" is an especially useful card to search, as it both searches "Assault Mode Activate" and sends itself to the GY to be Summoned back with "Psi-Reflector". "[[Assault Sentinel]]", "[[One for One]]", and "[[Emergency Teleport]]" can Special Summon "Psi-Reflector" from the Deck to start using it quickly; the former can also change a monster's [[Type]] and [[Attribute]] to meet the material restrictions for monsters like "[[Arcanite Magician]]", and can be searched with "[[Fire Formation - Tenki]]".

  The above combination of cards can also be used as a small engine for other Decks that appreciate their quick Synchro Summoning capabilities, since the combo allows for an instant Synchro Summon of any Synchro Monster from Level 5 to Level 9. As such, they can also be used to Summon powerful Synchro Monsters like "[[Naturia Beast]]", "[[Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn]]", or "[[Hi-Speedroid Kitedrake]]".

  Due to their varied strategies, some "/Assault Mode" boss monsters require different strategies to use their full potential.
  * "[[Arcanite Magician/Assault Mode]]": Works best in a [[Spell Counter]] Deck. In addition to the "Assault Sentinel" to "Psi-Reflector" combo, "[[Arcanite Magician]]" can be more easily Synchro Summoned using "[[Magical Exemplar]]". "[[Magical Citadel of Endymion]]" can also substitute a Spell Counter needed to activate its effect so it can maintain its high ATK. After it's destroyed and sent to the GY, where it would be unable to do anything, it can be fused to a [[Spellcaster]] Synchro Monster using "[[Miracle Synchro Fusion]]" to [[Fusion Summon]] "[[Supreme Arcanite Magician]]".
  * "[[Colossal Fighter/Assault Mode]]": Works best in a [[Warrior]] Deck. Warrior monsters that can quickly send other Warriors to the GY, such as "[[Armageddon Knight]]", "[[Dark Grepher]]" or "[[Vision HERO Vyon]]", can be particularly useful. "[[T.G. Striker]]" is an additional [[Tuner monster]] that can Special Summon itself, and can Synchro Summon "[[Colossal Fighter]]" by using it with "[[Destiny HERO - Malicious]]". Since it lowers the opponent's ATK, it's useless against [[Defense Position]] monsters, so "[[Final Attack Orders]]" can help.
  * "[[Doomkaiser Dragon/Assault Mode]]": It and "[[Doomkaiser Dragon]]" can Special Summon [[Zombie]] monsters from the opponent's GY, they fit best in a Deck built around "[[Zombie World]]". Since "[[Doomkaiser Dragon]]" requires "[[Plaguespreader Zombie]]" as its Tuner, "[[Psi-Reflector]]" cannot be used to Synchro Summon it. Furthermore, since its effect destroys the Summoned monsters during the [[End Phase]], the monsters should be used as material for additional [[Extra Deck]] monsters before then.
  * "[[Hyper Psychic Blaster/Assault Mode]]": Works best in a [[Psychic]] Deck. In addition to the "Assault Sentinel" to "Psi-Reflector" combo, "[[Hyper Psychic Blaster]]" can be Synchro Summoned by using "[[Overdrive Teleporter]]" to Special Summon a Level 3 Psychic Tuner from the Deck.
  * "[[T.G. Halberd Cannon/Assault Mode]]": The hardest "/Assault Mode" monster to Summon due to its original counterpart requiring 3 Synchro Monsters as material. Likely requires a dedicated swarm Deck to Summon reliably, or can be Summoned using "[[Assault Reboot]]".
  * "[[Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode]]" and "[[Red Dragon Archfiend/Assault Mode]]": The most flexible "/Assault Mode" monsters due to their generic effects and original forms requiring generic materials. Any strategy focused on Level 8 Synchro Monsters, such as "[[Resonator]]" or "[[Synchron]]", can work well with these cards.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Cards that prevent the summon of Synchro Monsters such as "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" slow down the deck's progression to its win condition and reduce the player's likely ceiling at the end of the turn. Cards that can negate the Summon of monsters also hinder the deck more than average.
  * Cards that can negate "Assault Mode Activate" are very effective against this deck. Most handtraps can stop the Deck's combo starters and "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" can negate "Assault Mode Activate".
  * If a Synchro Monster is banished, it can't be Special Summoned by its "/Assault Mode" form. Non-destruction removal will also prevent the "/Assault Mode" monster from Special Summoning its original form.
