  ==Etymology==
  The Japanese name of the "Sky Striker" archetype, ''Sentō'' ({{Ruby|閃|せん}}{{Ruby|刀|とう}}), is a multilayered wordplay. The kanji ''sen'' ({{Ruby|閃|せん}} "flash") can also mean "brandish", which ties into the kanji ''tō'' ({{Ruby|刀|とう}} "sword"). Together, they form a homophone with ''sentō'' ({{Ruby|戦|せん}}{{Ruby|闘|とう}} "battle"), referencing the war theme of the archetype.
  The Japanese name of the "Sky Striker Ace" sub-archetype adds the kanji ''ki'' ({{Ruby|姫|き}} lit. "princess") to the end of ''Sentō'', forming the name ''Sentōki'' ({{Ruby|閃|せん}}{{Ruby|刀|とう}}{{Ruby|姫|き}} lit. "Flash Sword Princess"). This creates an additional homophone with ''Sentōki'' ({{Ruby|戦|せん}}{{Ruby|闘|とう}}{{Ruby|機|き}} "[[wikipedia:Fighter aircraft|fighter aircraft]]"). This likely references how the term for aircraft, ''kitai'' ({{Ruby|機|き}}{{Ruby|体|たい}} lit. "airframe"), is also used in fiction to refer to powered armor and piloted robots.
  The Japanese name of the "Sky Striker Mecha" Spell Cards, ''Sentōki'' ({{Ruby|閃|せん}}{{Ruby|刀|とう}}{{Ruby|機|き}}, lit. "Flash Sword Machine"), also forms a homophone with the Japanese name of "Sky Striker Ace". The Japanese names of the other "Sky Striker" Spell Cards use kanji that include ''ki'' (き) in their readings for similar wordplays.
  ==Design==
  As suggested by its Japanese name, the "Sky Striker" archetype is based around fighter aircraft.
  "[[Sky Striker Ace - Raye]]" is named after the [[wikipedia:Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi A6M ''Reisen'']] ({{Ruby|零|れい}}{{Ruby|戦|せん}}, "Zero Fighter"). The ''Reisen'' was considered to be one of the most capable fighter aircraft of early World War II. The ''Master Guide 6'' describes "[[Sky Striker Ace - Kagari]]" as a mode specialized for ''tokkō'' ({{Ruby|特|とっ}}{{Ruby|攻|こう}}, lit. "special attack"), which alludes to the [[wikipedia:Japanese Special Attack Units|Japanese Special Attack Units]] in the Pacific War. This references how the ''Reisen'' was later adapted for kamikaze operations toward the end of the war when newer Allied designs surpassed it.
  The rapid deployment system of the "[[Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole]]" is based on the concept of a [[wikipedia:Multirole combat aircraft|multirole combat aircraft]]. The versatile ability to access any "Sky Striker Ace" mode and "Sky Striker Mecha" equipment in response to the situation allows "Raye" to fulfill a wide range of combat roles.
  "[[Sky Striker Ace - Roze]]", who serves the enemy [[Spectra Union]], is also named after a name for the Mitsubishi A6M. Instead of ''Reisen'', her namesake is "Zero", a name commonly used by Allied forces to refer to the A6M. It may also refer to ''Zerosen'', an alternative reading of ''Reisen''. "Roze" serving an enemy nation is possibly inspired by the [[wikipedia:Akutan Zero|Akutan Zero]], an intact A6M that was seized by the United States during the war.
  In contrast to the Japanese-style names of the other "Sky Striker Ace" modes, "[[Sky Striker Ace - Zeke]]" is named after "Zeke", the official [[wikipedia:World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied reporting name]] of the Mitsubishi A6M. "[[Surgical Striker - H.A.M.P.]]" (another weapon belonging to Spectra) is named after "Hamp", the Allied reporting name of the [[wikipedia:Mitsubishi A6M Zero#A6M3 Type 0 Model 32|Mitsubishi A6M3-32]]. This implies that the naming scheme of Spectra reflects the Allied powers of World War II, while the naming scheme of [[Karma]], the homeland of "Raye", reflects the Axis powers (specifically Japan). Ironically, the "Sky Striker Mecha" devices that support "Raye" are instead named after various American aircraft.
  ===Members===
  The [[Level]] 4 [[Warrior]]s "[[Sky Striker Ace - Raye|Raye]]" and "[[Sky Striker Ace - Roze|Roze]]" are the heart of the Deck, as all other "Sky Striker Ace" monsters are [[Machine]] [[Link Monster]]s depicted as their armored combat modes.
  The majority of "Sky Striker" cards are designated with codes visible in their artworks. The codes for the combat modes are divided between an X-series for "Raye" and a Z-series for "Roze".

  ==Playing style==
  The "Sky Striker" strategy is an exclusively control focused playstyle where the goal is to generate more card advantage than the opponent and prevent them from making plays through disruption. The general playstyle of "Sky Striker" involves using "Sky Striker" [[Spell Card]]s to generate card advantage and disrupt the opponent, using "[[Sky Striker Ace]]" [[Link Monster]]s to gain access to "Sky Striker" Spell Cards, and winning the game by out-grinding the opponent's resources.
  The "Sky Striker" Spell Cards all share the [[activation requirement]] that there must be no monsters in the [[Main Monster Zone]] to [[activate]] them, except "[[Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole]]" and "[[Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero]]". In addition, each "Sky Striker" Spell Card has an extra advantageous effect when there are 3 or more Spell Cards in the [[GY]] (except for "Linkage!", which instead requires the player to have both LIGHT and DARK "Sky Striker Aces" on the field and/or in the GY). As such, a "Sky Striker" player must find a way to put 3 Spell Cards in the GY as quickly as possible, in order to maximize their card advantage.

  | Sends 1 other card the player controls to GY to Special Summon 1 "Sky Striker Ace" from Extra Deck to Extra Monster Zone
  | That monster gains 1000 ATK
  |}
  The two key "Sky Striker" Spell Cards that enable their grind strategy are "[[Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!]]" and "[[Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole]]". "Engage!" can search out a "Sky Striker" card when activated, and provide an additional card draw afterwards if there are 3 or more Spell Cards in the GY, giving an immediate +1 in card advantage when activated. "Multirole" meanwhile can re-[[Set]] used "Sky Striker" Spell Cards in the GY during the [[End Phase]], providing a massive boost in card advantage for disruptions.
  Three "Sky Striker Ace" Link Monsters, "[[Sky Striker Ace - Kagari|Kagari]]", "[[Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku|Shizuku]]", and "[[Sky Striker Ace - Hayate|Hayate]]", are the primary ways in which a "Sky Striker" player gains access to their Spell Cards; "Kagari" can [[add]] one from the GY to the hand when [[Summon]]ed; "Shizuku" can add one from the Deck to the hand during the End Phase of the turn it was Summoned; and "Hayate" can [[send]] one from the [[Deck]] to the GY after it battles. "Kagari", "Shizuku", and "Hayate" (along with "Kaina") are all Link 1 Monsters that require a different "Sky Striker Ace" monster as [[Link Material]], meaning that 1 "Sky Striker Ace" monster can provide access to all of them and cycle through them to use all of their effects.
  To push for an [[OTK]], the archetype typically uses the "[[Crystron Halqifibrax]]" + "[[Effect Veiler]]" → "[[Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians]]" → "[[Accesscode Talker]]" link-climbing line to make a 5300 ATK Accesscode, who can destroy multiple cards thanks to the multi-Attribute Link Monsters provided by the archetype.

  ===Weakness===
  * "Sky Striker" [[Deck]]s focus heavily on [[Spell Card]]s, allowing cards like "[[Imperial Order]]", "[[Secret Village of the Spellcasters]]" and "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]" to slow down the Deck. "[[Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell]]" and "[[Spell Vanishing]]" can be particularly effective if used against "[[Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!]]" or "[[Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones]]".
  * Due to their fairly low [[ATK]], the individual "[[Sky Striker Ace]]" monsters are easily defeated if their Spell [[support]] can be countered.
  * Due to their reliance on Spell Cards to defeat stronger monsters, certain monsters with card effect immunity or targeting protection, such as "[[Super Quantal Mech King Great Magnus]]" or "[[Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax]]" can prove troublesome for a "Sky Striker" monsters to beat over by battle.
  * Anti-[[search]]ing effects can be potent, though the effects of "[[Sky Striker Ace - Kagari]]" and "[[Sky Striker Ace - Hayate|Hayate]]" can get around this.
  * Summoning Tribute-monsters such as "[[Santa Claws]]" or "[[Kaiju]]" monsters to a "Sky Striker" player's field can also be considered for two reasons. First, this prevents the "Sky Striker" Spell Cards that can disrupt the opponent during their turn from being activated since they are required to control no monsters in the Main Monster Zones (since "Santa Claws" or "Kaiju" monsters can only be Summoned to said Zones) until that Tribute monster is gone. Second, if the "Sky Striker Ace" Link Monsters are Tributed for Summoning those Tribute-monsters, it bypasses the effect of "Sky Striker Ace - Raye" that Special Summons itself from the GY, since the Link Monsters are not considered to have left the field by an opponent's card effect this way.
