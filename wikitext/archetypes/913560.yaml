  "'''Gold Pride'''" is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Photon Hypernova]]''.

  == Etymology ==
  "Gold Pride" is the name given to the race in which the various monsters of the archetype participate in.

  == Design ==
  The members of the "Gold Pride" archetype are made up of a variety of personalities and different vehicles which are all represented by none of them sharing the same [[Type]] and [[Attribute]]. Their shared [[Special Summon]] condition could also be seen as coming from behind in a race.

  == Playing style ==
  "Gold Pride" is an archetype centered around [[Special Summon|Special Summoning]] themselves from the hand while having less Life Points than the opponent, making them have good synergy with the [[P.U.N.K.]] archetype. One other shared trait of the theme is that of the "Gold Pride" [[Extra Deck]] monsters having effects that trigger at the [[End Phase]] if you use their primary effect to return themselves from the field to the Extra Deck and Special Summon a corresponding "Gold Pride" monster.

  Barring this, the theme is capable of [[Synchro Summon|Synchro Summoning]] various [[Level]] 6 or 11 [[Synchro Monster]]s using the effects of "[[Gold Pride - Leon]]. One of these being the Level 6 monster, "[[Gold Pride - Star Leon]]", having a powerful effect to gain ATK by targetting an opponent's monster and destroying it if your LP is lower than the opponent's. This combined with the effect of "[[Gold Pride - Captain Carrie]]" can make "Star Leon" a powerful monster able to potentially take out opponents rather quickly.
