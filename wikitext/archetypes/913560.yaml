  "'''Gold Pride'''" is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Photon Hypernova]]''.

  == Etymology ==
  "Gold Pride" is the name given to the race in which the various monsters of the archetype participate in.

  == Design ==
  The members of the "Gold Pride" archetype are made up of a variety of personalities and different vehicles which are all represented by none of them sharing the same [[Type]] and [[Attribute]]. Their shared [[Special Summon]] condition could also be seen as coming from behind in a race.

  == Playing style ==
  "Gold Pride" is an archetype centered around [[Special Summon]]ing its Main Deck monsters from the hand while the player has less Life Points than the opponent. From there, the Deck can use these monsters for Extra Deck [[Synchro Summon|Synchro]] or [[Link Summon]]ing plays; "[[Gold Pride - Nytro Head|Nytro Head]]" specifically also functions as a field-controlling endboard monster itself.

  "[[Gold Pride - Leon|Leon]]" is the Deck's main combo enabler for Extra Deck plays, able to swarm multiple monsters by itself, and being able to perform Synchro Summons in the opponent's turn; as of February 2023, "Leon" can combo with other "Gold Pride" Main Deck monsters to easily Synchro Summon [[Level]] 6 or 11 [[Synchro Monster]]s.

  Each "Gold Pride" [[Extra Deck]] monster has an effect that mandatorily triggers at the [[End Phase]] if the player uses their primary effect during the turn, which has them return themselves from the field to the Extra Deck and Special Summon a corresponding "Gold Pride" monster.

  "Gold Pride" Spell & Trap support (with the Traps being searchable by "[[Gold Pride - Captain Carrie|Captain Carrie]]") provide additional swarming, interruption, and utility.

  Externally, the archetype has good synergy with the [[P.U.N.K.]] archetype, which requires [[pay]]ing LP to activate their effects (thereby enabling the effects of "Gold Pride" monsters) and synergizes with the Deck's use of Synchro Summoning.
