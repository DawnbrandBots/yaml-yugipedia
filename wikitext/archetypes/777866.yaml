  "'''Zexal'''" (ゼアル ''Zearu''), is an [[archetype]] used by [[Yuma Tsukumo]] and [[Astral]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]''. It consists of cards that are closely related and support several archetypes used by these characters in the show, including the "[[Utopia (archetype)|Utopia]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]", "[[Rank-Down-Magic]]", "[[ZW -]]", and "[[ZS -]]" archetypes.

  Cards from the "ZW -" and "ZS -" archetypes are also considered to be part of this archetype, since their Japanese names contain 「ゼアル」. All current support for this archetype only supports [[Spell]] or [[Trap]] Cards, making the acronymized international names for said archetypes a non-issue.
