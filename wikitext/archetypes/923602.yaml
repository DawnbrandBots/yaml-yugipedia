  "'''Nemurelia'''" (ネムレリア) is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] monsters introduced in ''[[Cyberstorm Access]]''.

  ==Etymology==

  ==Design==
  The Nemurelia archetype is based around "[[Dreaming Nemurelia]]", whose dreams manifest as a candy- and dessert-themed world, with her sleeping atop "[[The Sleeping Beauty Tower of Nemurelia]]" and being protected by "[[Nemurelia's Dream Defender - Couette]]" and "[[Nemurelia's Dream Defender - Oreiller]]".

  ==Playing style==
  "'''Nemurelia'''" is an archetype focused around adding "Dreaming Nemurelia" to the face-up [[Extra Deck]] and banishing cards from the face-down Extra Deck to gain advantage, working to [[Special Summon]] "Dreaming Nemurelia" from the Extra Deck and utilizing its removal effect to clear the opponents field.
