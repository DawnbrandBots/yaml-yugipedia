  "'''Attraction'''" (アトラクション ''Atorakushon'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Normal Trap Card|Normal Trap]]s that debuted in ''[[Lightning Overdrive]]''. It is closely related to the "[[Amazement]]" archetype.
  While this archetype's [[support]] cards only list the string アトラクション (''Atorakushon''), all of its members include it as [[wikipedia:Ruby character|Ruby text]] above a [[wikipedia:Turned A|turned A]]: {{Ruby|Ɐ|アトラクション}}.
  ==Design==
  Each card in the archetype references an amusement park attraction and another previously released archetype within the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game|Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG]]''; all of them feature "[[Amazement Administrator Arlekino]]" in their artworks, apparently to advertise the attraction, and their effects are tied to the archetypes they are based on. All of the attractions' names are also made up of two words with the same initials.
