  | [[Geas Gandora the Dragon of Destruction]]
  | All other cards on the field are first destroyed and then banished after its controller pays half of their LP, then Special Summons a Level 7 or lower monster from the Deck that mentions "[[Gold Sarcophagus of Light]]" and increases that monster's Level by the number of cards destroyed.
  | 300 ATK for each card banished.
  |}
  ==Playing style==
  So far, all "Gandora" monsters have a [[nuke|nuking]] effect followed by an [[ATK]] gain, and the downside of [[Halves LP|halving]] the player's own [[LP]].
  Since the nuking effect of "[[Gigarays Gandora the Dragon of Destruction]]" becomes more potent the more unique "Gandora" monsters in the [[Graveyard]], using cards like "[[Foolish Burial]]" or "[[Trade-In]]" helps with consistency and power simultaneously.
  Note that even if cards like "[[Macro Cosmos]]" help you to increase the ATK of "Gandora Giga Rays", they aren't recommended because they also prevent you from Special Summoning it.
