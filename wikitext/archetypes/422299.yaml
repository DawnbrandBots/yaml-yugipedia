  ==Playing style==
  All "Gandora" monsters have a [[nuke|nuking]] effect followed by an [[ATK]] gain, and the downside of [[Halves LP|halving]] the player's own [[LP]]. Due to lacking in-archetype searching, summoning, or utility-based support, "Gandora" does not form a themed strategy by itself. Instead, they can be played as generic boss monsters for Decks that can tutor them, such as [[Dragon Link]].
