  ==Playing style==
  "Infinitracks" focus on quickly Summoning [[EARTH]] Machine monsters in order to perform high-Rank Xyz Summons. Most Main Deck "Infinitracks" are [[Level]] 5, and can Special Summon themselves from the hand by Tributing an EARTH Machine monster. Each of the Level 5 monsters also have an Ignition Effect that can be activated by banishing itself or another Machine monster from the Graveyard. The two non-Level 5 "Infinitracks" either [[Infinitrack Harvester|search]] for resources or [[Infinitrack Anchor Drill|provide material]] for a Summon. Also, both of them can change the Levels of themselves and another Machine to their combined Levels (7 for "[[Infinitrack Harvester|Harvester]]", 9 for "[[Infinitrack Anchor Drill|Anchor Drill]]"), giving them access to stronger Xyz Monsters more easily.
  Currently, all Xyz Monsters of this archetype have the shared effect of being able to attach monsters they destroy in battle as material. Also, they can Special Summon themselves from the Graveyard by Tributing a Machine Link monster. This last effect can be combined with "[[Infinitrack Goliath]]", as it can immediately attach itself to any Xyz as a material if sent to the Graveyard and gives immunity to effect destruction while attached to a Machine.
  The boss of the archetype is "[[Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops]]", a Link-3 4000-ATK monster that has blanket immunity against non-Xyz monsters and can revive an Xyz monster every turn. Its steep Summoning requirement (3 Xyz monsters) makes it relatively difficult to Summon, but the materials can be gathered by the self-reviving effects of the "Infinitrack" Xyz monsters, as well as by "[[Zoodiac Chakanine]]", that can be easily accessed by "[[Zoodiac Barrage]]".
  Other than the archtypical cards, the deck also have synergy with other EARTH Machine themes, such as "[[Machina]]" and "[[Train]]", thus allow the user to add cards from these theme for additional flexibility.
