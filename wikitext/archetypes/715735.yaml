  {{Quote|The archetype's tagline in promotional material|This is the story of the "beginning".}}
  "'''Magistus'''" (マギストス ''Magisutosu'') is an [[archetype]] of monsters with various [[Type]]s (primarily [[Spellcaster]]) and [[Attribute]]s which debuted in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Genesis Impactors]]''.

  ==Etymology==
  ''Magistus'' is based on [[wikipedia:Hermes Trismegistus|Hermes Trismegistus]], the purported author of the [[wikipedia:Hermetica|Hermetic Corpus]], a series of sacred texts that are the basis of [[wikipedia:Hermeticism|Hermeticism]]. 

  In Japanese, all "Magistus" cards have kanji names with a non-standard reading, with "Magistus" always forming part of this non-standard reading. "Magistus" does not correspond to any particular kanji base.

  In Japanese, each of the monsters is associated with one of the the four Great Sages, including the title of their corresponding Great Sage in their own kanji name (Lawbook, Absolute Flame, Crystal, or Sacred Magic); this naming convention was not included in their ''TCG'' names.

  ==Design==
  The "Magistus" archetype depicts the younger counterparts to the key members of the "[[Invoked]]", "[[Witchcrafter]]", and "[[Endymion]]" archetypes; namely "[[Aleister the Invoker]]", "[[Witchcrafter Madame Verre]]", and "[[Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic]]", alongside a magician character not seen in preexisting archetypes, "[[Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame]]". Based on the card artworks and preexisting card lore, "Aleister", "Verre" (real name "Rilliona"), "Endymion", and "Zoroa" were powerful magicians that formed a magical group known as the "Magistus" in the past, before they separated from each other and founded their own independent magical groups.

  "Magistus" monsters are associated with one of the four great sages, reflected by the inclusion of the unique component of the great sage's title in their own name (in Japanese kanji). The monsters within each of the four groups fit one of three roles:
  * A Main Deck "Magistus", depicting the titular "Magistus" great sage, who (excluding "Zoroa") is also a key member of their origin archetype
  * A usually non-Spellcaster Extra Deck "Magistus", depicting the guardian deity associated with a "Magistus" magician, who usually also has a counterpart in their origin archetype
  * A Spellcaster Extra Deck "Magistus" (sharing the same monster card type as their guardian deity), depicting an empowered form of a "Magistus" great sage

  ==Playing style==
  "Magistus" is an archetype focused on summoning Level 4 Spellcasters, using them to perform [[Fusion Summon|Fusion]], [[Synchro Summon|Synchro]], [[Xyz Summon|Xyz]], and [[Link Summon|Link]] summons, and equipping "Magistus" monsters with Extra Deck "Magistus" monsters to grant beneficial effects.

  The "Magistus" archetype contains 4 Main Deck Level 4 Spellcaster monsters. All "Magistus" Main Deck monsters have individual effects and a shared effect involving equipping "Magistus" monsters with "Magistus" Extra Deck monsters.

  The "Magistus" archetype contains multiple Extra Deck monsters of various [[Monster card type]]s, including [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]], [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] (all Level 8), [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] (all Rank 4), and [[Link Monster]]s. With the exception of "[[Zoroa, the Magistus Conflagrant Calamity]]", each "Magistus" Extra Deck monster has one or more effects that are only usable when they're equipped to any monster as an [[Equip Card]], along with normal monster effects usable when they're summoned.

  The "Magistus" Extra Deck monsters' Equip effects provide either [[Continuous-like Effect|Continuous]] protection or [[Ignition-like Effect|Ignition]] searching and removal. Among these Equip effects, the Ignition searching effect of "Artemis" the most important, as it generates free advantage, while the other equip effects are far more situational.

  The deck has good consistency and recursion, but average boss monsters, and thus often has to be supported by other decks such as "[[Invoked]]" or "[[Dogmatika]]", who also feature Level 4 Spellcaster monsters. Rather unsurprisingly, "Crowley" has synergies with the "Invoked" archetype, with his effect being able to support the Fusion Summon of "Invoked" monsters. "Crowley" can also be used to change its Attribute to WATER and overlay with "Endymion" into "[[Bahamut Shark]]" to make a "[[Toadally Awesome]]". Other generic [[Rank 4]] options may be a good idea to look into for potential synergies.

  ==Trivia==
  * The concept of ''Hermes Trismegistus'' is also present in the cards "[[Helios Trice Megistus]]" and "[[Megistric Maginician]]".
  * The individual effects of "[[Endymion, the Magistus of Mastery|Endymion]]", "[[Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires|Crowley]]", and "[[Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre|Rilliona]]" partially synergize with the playstyles of their origin archetypes (i.e. "[[Endymion]]", "[[Invoked]]", and "[[Witchcrafter]]") respectively in addition to synergizing with the "Magistus" playstyle.
