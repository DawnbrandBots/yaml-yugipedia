  <blockquote>
  ;''The Two Knights' Differences Collide''
  ''The "[[Crusadia]]" fellowship arrived at the place where the final battle would likely be fought. However, what awaited them was the "Orcust Army". The true identity of "[[Longirsu, the Orcust Orchestrator|Longirsu]]" is that of "[[Beckoned by the World Chalice|Ningirsu]]" who severed the bonds of friendship with [[World Chalice|his former friends]] and disappeared with [[Orcustrated Return|his own goals]] in mind. "Orcust" is an army of [[machine]]s he created to achieve his ultimate goal. The "Orcust" continue to ceaselessly appear from "[[Orcustrated Babel|Babel]]" and [[Orcustrated Einsatz|prevent the "Crusadia" fellowship from getting any further]]. [[Orcustrated Attack|These two former friends now wage a fierce battle against one another]].''<ref>https://ygorganization.com/mylittlesistercantpossiblybethisdead/</ref>
  </blockquote>
  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  "Orphegel" comes from [[wikipedia:Orpheus|Orpheus]], [[wikipedia:Belphegor|Belphegor]] and Orgel (the Dutch/German/Japanese term for music boxes). The name links to the "World Legacy" story, where "[[Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior|Ningirsu]]" is paralleling Orpheus in his quest to revive a loved one. The demonic mechanical theme comes from Belphegor, who was said to lure people to sloth through the gift of knowledge to allow them to create great inventions, while Orgel simply relates to many of the monsters featuring a music box within their design.<ref>https://ygorganization.com/dont-download-music-from-napsister/</ref> "Orcust" could come from [[wikipedia:Orcus|Orcus]], a Roman deity of the underworld, and "Orchestra", while "Orcustrated" sounds like "Orchestrated" which can also mean "planned" or "coordinated".
  The Main Deck monsters are named after musical elements and have aspects of musical instruments as part of their bodies.

  ==Playing style==
  The [[Main Deck]] monsters all have effects to [[banish]] themselves from the [[Graveyard]] to [[Special Summon]] other "Orcust" monsters from various locations, but prevent the player from Special Summoning monsters except DARK monsters for the rest of the turn. The [[Link Monster]]s all have diagonally opposing [[Link Marker]]s, any additional Link Markers are on the Top or Bottom. The Link Monsters each have an immunity effect when linked, and a second effect that must be activated by returning banished Machine monsters to the Deck.
  The main goal of the Deck is to banish the Main Deck "Orcust" monsters in order to activate their effects and provide Link Materials for the "Orcust" Link monsters in the process, as well as fuel for their effects. With this, the player can recycle those banished monsters to activate the effects of the Link monsters. Despite having [[Spell Speed 1]] effects, those Link monsters' effects become [[Spell Speed 2]] if "[[Orcustrated Babel]]" is active, adding a layer of disruption to the strategy. The blanket protection that prevents "[[Longirsu, the Orcust Orchestrator]]" and "[[Orcustrion]]" from being destroyed by card effects while linked makes it possible to safely combine them with cards like "[[Limiter Removal]]". Also, if backed by "Babel" and "[[Topologic Bomber Dragon]]", the Graveyard effects of the Main Deck "Orcust" monsters can be used during the opponent's turn and destroy the monsters in their Main Monster Zones.
  Alternatively, since the Orcust monsters are all [[DARK]], it can be used with [[Phantom Knights]] cards. This can be used to turbo out "[[True King of All Calamities]]" using "[[The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch]]" locking your opponent from using [[Monster effect]]s.
