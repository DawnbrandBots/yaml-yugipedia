  "'''Toon'''" (トゥーン ''Tūn'') is an [[archetype]] of cards used by [[Maximillion Pegasus]].
  All [[Toon monster]]s are "Toon" cards—including "[[Manga Ryu-Ran]]", because it has 「トゥーン」 in its Japanese name. "[[Toon Alligator]]" is the only monster of this archetype that is not also a Toon monster.
  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  Each "Toon" monster (with the exception of "[[Toon Alligator]]") is a highly exaggerated [[wikipedia:Cartoon|cartoon]] [[wikipedia:Caricature|caricature]] of another monster.
  In the original manga and anime series, Toon monsters are simply the original monsters after being transformed by "[[Toon World (manga)|Toon World]]". After they appeared as separate cards in the ''OCG'', Toon monsters appeared as separate cards in the anime as well.
  ===Members===
  Based on their effect patterns, "Toon" monsters can be divided into several types of designs.
  ; Special Summon-only Monster (Toon World Required)
  Shared effects:
  * Cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. Must first be Special Summoned (from your hand) by Tributing [the same amount of monsters as required for a [[Tribute Summon]] of a monster with its original Level], while you control "[[Toon World]]".
  * Cannot attack the turn it is Special Summoned.
  * You must pay 500 LP to declare an attack with this monster.
  * If "Toon World" on the field is destroyed, destroy this card.
  * Can attack your opponent directly, unless they control a Toon monster, in which case this card must target a Toon monster for its attacks.

  |}
  ==Playing style==
  The main strategy of a "Toon" Deck is direct attacks on your opponent. For some Toon monsters, "[[Toon World]]" is required for them to be able to attack the opponent directly while they control monsters. "[[Toon Table of Contents]]" and "[[Toon Bookmark]]" can aid you in adding "Toon" cards to your hand.
  As several Toon monsters can be [[Special Summoned]] from the hand by their own effect, while you control "Toon World", it's possible to Summon multiple Toon monsters in one turn. Although Level 5 or higher Toon monsters require Tributes for their Special Summon, as the Tributes are not Tributes for a [[Tribute Summon]], you can Tribute [[Monster Token]]s generated from cards like "[[Scapegoat]]" and "[[Fires of Doomsday]]".
  Since a lot of the Toon monsters can be Special Summoned when "Toon World" is on your field you can create a big swarm of monsters for a fast [[Xyz Summon]] or Summon a Tuner monster for a fast [[Synchro Summon]].
  "[[Toon Gemini Elf]]" and "[[Toon Masked Sorcerer]]" can maintain hand control, because they can attack directly while you control "Toon World", at which time their effects will trigger ("Toon Gemini Elf" forces your opponent to discard a random card from their hand, while "Toon Masked Sorcerer" allows you to draw a card).
  With the addition of cards such as "[[Red-Eyes Toon Dragon]]" and "[[Toon Dark Magician]]", Toon decks can not only swarm a lot easier and get access to their support a lot more consistently as well, but opens the deck up for Rank 7 [[Xyz Summon]] plays as well. Cards such as "[[The Black Stone of Legend]]" and "[[Toon Page-Flip]]" can make the task of summoning these high-level Toon monsters a lot easier, and the additions of [[Toon Black Luster Soldier]]" and "[[Toon Harpie Lady]]" create removal opportunities as well.
  ===Strengths===
  * The ability to always attack directly unless facing another Toon deck allows the player to inflict large amounts of damage and avoid hard to deal with opposing monsters.
  * Using "[[Phantom Skyblaster]]" can generate [[Skyblaster Token]]s, which are useful as Tributes for Level 5 and above Toons. "Phantom Skyblaster" also provides further damage with its effect in combination with "[[Toon Cannon Soldier]]'s" effect, while giving you access to "[[Number 66: Master Key Beetle]]" to further protect your "Toon World".
  * Toon decks can access strong [[Xyz Monster]]s with powerful negation effects including:
  ** "[[Toadally Awesome]]" can be Summoned by "[[Bahamut Shark]]" who itself is Summoned using 2 [[Level 4 Monster Cards|Level 4]] [[WATER]] monsters, like "Toon Mermaid" or "[[Toon Alligator]]".
  ** "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]" can be summoned using two copies of "[[Toon Cyber Dragon]]" to Summon "[[Cyber Dragon Nova]]" and then Special Summon "Infinity" by using "Nova" as material.
  ** "[[Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy]]" by using two [[Level 8 Monster Cards|Level 8]] monsters.
  * "[[Comic Hand]]" uses your opponent's monsters against them, which can make up for the lack of removal Toon cards have.
  * "[[Red-Eyes Toon Dragon]]", "[[Toon Dark Magician]]", and "[[Toon Mask]]" are ideal methods for swarming with other Toon monsters while ignoring their Summoning conditions; "Comic Hand" can also bolster their presence by virtue of turning the targeted opponent's monster into a Toon.
  * If "Toon World" would be destroyed, "[[Emergency Provisions]]" can be chained to send it to the Graveyard instead, preventing your Toons from destroying themselves via their own effects.
  * "[[Starlight Road]]" is very useful against mass destruction cards that pose a threat against "Toon World".
  === Weaknesses ===
  * Toon monsters are very reliant on "[[Toon World]]" and most of them are destroyed when "Toon World" is destroyed.
  ** Cards like "[[Stardust Dragon]]", "[[Dark Bribe]]", "[[Card Guard]]", "[[Carrierroid]]" and "[[Solemn Judgment]]" can negate card destruction effects.
  * Most of the Toon monsters are high-Leveled monsters, so they can easily be dead draws if there aren't enough monsters available to Tribute. To avert this, "[[Toon Mask]]", "[[Toon Dark Magician]]", "[[Red-Eyes Toon Dragon]]" can be used to Special Summon them, or they can be used as a cost for "[[Trade-In]]" or "[[Sacred Sword of Seven Stars]]".
