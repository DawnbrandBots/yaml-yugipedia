  "'''Advanced Crystal Beast'''", known as "'''Advanced Gem Beast'''" ({{Ruby|Ａ|アドバンスド}}{{Ruby|宝|ほう}}{{Ruby|玉|ぎょく}}{{Ruby|獣|じゅう}} ''Adobansudo Hōgyokujū'') in Japan, are an [[archetype]] of cards used by [[Yubel (character)|Yubel]] while she possessed [[Jesse Anderson]]. It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Crystal Beast]]" archetype.
  They are wild, more feral, and more armored versions of their [[Crystal Beast|original forms]], complete with their own ace card, "[[Rainbow Dark Dragon]]" who rivals "[[Rainbow Dragon]]". 
  ==History==
  The "Advanced Crystal Beasts" first appeared in Season 3 of ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'', which aired in 2007.
  "[[Rainbow Dark Dragon]]" (the theme's boss monster, despite not being a member of the archetype) was released in ''[[Phantom Darkness]]'' (''OCG'': 2007, ''TCG'': 2008).
  "[[Advanced Dark (anime)|Advanced Dark]]" appeared in the video games ''[[Advanced Dark (Tag Force 3)|Tag Force 3]]'', ''[[Advanced Dark (Tag Force 4)|Tag Force 4]]'', ''[[Advanced Dark (Tag Force 5)|Tag Force 5]]'', and ''[[Advanced Dark (Tag Force 6)|Tag Force 6]]'' before its ''OCG'' debut. In these games, its effects differed slightly from the later-released ''OCG'' card. "[[Advanced Dark]]" was released in the ''OCG'' in ''[[Duelist Edition Volume 2]]'' (2012) and in the ''TCG'' in ''[[Return of the Duelist]]'' (2012).
  "Advanced Crystal Beasts" debuted in the ''OCG'' in ''[[Animation Chronicle 2022]]'' (and in the ''TCG'' in ''[[Battles of Legend: Crystal Revenge]]'') with improved effects from their anime counterparts.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Advanced Crystal Beast" archetype is mechanically similar to their original "[[Crystal Beast]]" counterparts with a few major changes. Monsters of both archetypes share the effect where if they are destroyed while in the [[Monster Zone]], then they can be placed in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] as a [[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous Spell]]. Where the two archetypes differ is in two major ways; the first being the requirement of the [[Field Spell Card]] "[[Advanced Dark]]" to be on the field or else the "Advanced Crystal Beasts" will be sent to the [[Graveyard|GY]] while the second being the "Advanced Crystal Beasts" having upgraded versions of their effects as regular "Crystal Beast" monsters, though limited to supporting their own archetype as opposed to regular "Crystal Beast" monsters.

  |}
  Overall, the playing style of "Advanced Crystal Beasts" is similar to that of their uncorrupted counterparts; fill the board with 7 "Crystal Beast" monsters in order to make the archetype's boss monster "[[Rainbow Dragon]]" and its [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]] variants "[[Rainbow Overdragon]]" and "[[Ultimate Crystal Rainbow Dragon Overdrive]]". "[[Rainbow Dark Dragon]]" is also an option to use as an "[[Ultimate Crystal]]" monster, since "Advanced Dark" will treat all "Crystal Beast" monsters as [[DARK]] monsters, but since its Summoning requirement involves banishing such monsters from the GY, it can hinder the Deck's ability to Summon "Overdrive". The primary benefit of this archetype over its uncorrupted counterpart is in its monsters' more powerful effects compared to the originals, allowing it to reduce the number of original "Crystal Beast" monsters in the Deck to just "[[Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus]]", "[[Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle]]" and "[[Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon]]" while still having enough names to Summon "Rainbow Dragon". In addition, "Advanced Dark" allows the archetype to utilize tactics and cards focused on DARK monsters, such as "[[Raider's Knight]]".

  However, there are some support cards that this archetype cannot utilize properly. For example, "[[Crystal Abundance]]" sends as many cards on the field as possible to the GY, which would include "Advanced Dark", meaning that this Deck would be unable to Special Summon "Advanced Crystal Beast" monsters with its effect as they would be immediately sent to the GY again.
