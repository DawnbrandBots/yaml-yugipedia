  "'''Advanced Crystal Beast'''", known as "'''Advanced Gem Beast'''" ({{Ruby|Ａ|アドバンスド}}{{Ruby|宝|ほう}}{{Ruby|玉|ぎょく}}{{Ruby|獣|じゅう}} ''Adobansudo Hōgyokujū'') in Japan, are an [[archetype]] of cards used by [[Yubel (character)|Yubel]] while she possessed [[Jesse Anderson]]. It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Crystal Beast]]" archetype.

  They are wild, more feral, and more armored versions of their [[Crystal Beast|original forms]], complete with their own ace card, "[[Rainbow Dark Dragon]]" who rivals "[[Rainbow Dragon]]". 

  ==History==
  The "Advanced Crystal Beasts" first appeared in Season 3 of ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'', which aired in 2007.

  "[[Rainbow Dark Dragon]]" (the theme's boss monster, despite not being a member of the archetype) was released in the ''OCG'' in ''[[Duelist Edition Volume 2]]'' (2007) and in the ''TCG'' in ''[[Phantom Darkness]]'' (2008).

  "[[Advanced Dark (anime)|Advanced Dark]]" appeared in the video games ''[[Advanced Dark (Tag Force 3)|Tag Force 3]]'', ''[[Advanced Dark (Tag Force 4)|Tag Force 4]]'', ''[[Advanced Dark (Tag Force 5)|Tag Force 5]]'', and ''[[Advanced Dark (Tag Force 6)|Tag Force 6]]'' before its ''OCG'' debut. In these games, its effects differed slightly from the later-released ''OCG'' card. "[[Advanced Dark]]" was released in the ''OCG'' in ''[[Duelist Edition Volume 2]]'' (2007) and in the ''TCG'' in ''[[Return of the Duelist]]'' (2012).

  "Advanced Crystal Beasts" debuted in the ''OCG'' in ''[[Animation Chronicle 2022]]'' (and in the ''TCG'' in ''[[Battles of Legend: Crystal Revenge]]'') with improved effects from their anime counterparts.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Advanced Crystal Beast" archetype is mechanically similar to their original "[[Crystal Beast]]" counterparts with a few major changes. Monsters of both archetypes share the effect where if they are destroyed while in the [[Monster Zone]], then they can be placed in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] as a [[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous Spell]]. Where the two archetypes differ is in two major ways; the first being the requirement of the [[Field Spell Card]] "[[Advanced Dark]]" to be on the field or else the "Advanced Crystal Beasts" will be sent to the [[Graveyard|GY]] while the second being the "Advanced Crystal Beasts" having upgraded versions of their effects as regular "Crystal Beast" monsters, though limited to supporting their own archetype as opposed to regular "Crystal Beast" monsters.

  Overall, the playing style of "Advanced Crystal Beasts" is similar to that of their uncorrupted counterparts; fill the board with 7 Crystal Beast monsters in order to make the archetype's boss monster "[[Rainbow Dragon]] and its [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]] variants "[[Rainbow Overdragon]]" and "[[Ultimate Crystal Rainbow Dragon Overdrive]]". "[[Rainbow Dark Dragon]]" is also an option to use for an "[[Ultimate Crystal]]" monster, but is not as optimal due to the severe cost of banishing 7 DARK monsters with different names from your Graveyard. The primary benefit of this archetype however is, because of the effect of "Advanced Dark", your monsters are treated as "[[DARK]]" monsters on the field and in the Graveyard, which combined to the higher consistency of their cards allows for "Advanced Crystal Beasts" to utilize tactics and cards focused on DARK monsters.

  However, the theme is unable to properly utilize certain cards their uncorrupted counterparts can use to great degree. One such card is the Spell Card "[[Crystal Abundance]]", which sends as many cards on the field as possible to the Graveyard for its effect and reborns a number of "Crystal Beast" monsters from your Graveyard up to how many cards were sent from the opponent's field. Because "Crystal Abundance" sends as many cards as possible to the Graveyard, this includes "Advanced Dark" and would result in your reborn "Advanced Crystal Beasts" being sent from the field to the Graveyard once again.
