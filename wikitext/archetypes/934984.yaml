  ==Design==

  ===Etymology===
  "Nouvellez" is named after [[wikipedia:Nouvelle cuisine|nouvelle cuisine]], a style of French cuisine characterized by delicate dishes that emphasize presentation.

  ===Members===
  Each of the "Nouvellez" monsters (except the "[[Nouvellez Token]]") are based on both a demon (principally from the ''[[wikipedia:Ars Goetia|Ars Goetia]]'') and an aspect of French cuisine. Their names are a combination of the name of the demon and the French name of the aspect of French cuisine. Each member has a varying number of star decoration(s) on their body, matching with their Level.

  They all have 1850 [[DEF]], the same as the related "[[Hungry Burger]]".

  ==Playing style==
  "Nouvellez" is an archetype of [[Ritual Monster]]s centered around [[Tribute|Tributing]] [[Attack Position]] monsters. All "Nouvellez" monsters have effects that allow them to Tribute cards when targeted for an attack or a card effect to [[Special Summon]] a "Nouvellez" monster that is 1 or 2 Levels higher than that monster's Level. Each pair of monsters also share activation conditions with one another. For example: The [[Level]] 1 and 2 monsters, "[[Buerillabaisse de Nouvellez]]" and "[[Confitras de Nouvellez]]", share the effect that when they are targeted for an attack or effect, they can Tribute themselves and 1 Attack Position monster on either side of the field to Special Summon a new "Nouvellez" monster with 1 or 2 Levels higher than them from the [[hand]] or Deck. The Level 3 and 4 monsters, "[[Poêlétis de Nouvellez]]" and "[[Foie Glasya de Nouvellez]]", share a similar effect, which can be activated when any monster is targeted, and they can also Tribute other "Nouvellez" monsters over themselves. Finally, the Level 5 "[[Balameuniere de Nouvellez]]" can Tribute just an opponent's Attack Position monster to Summon only a Level 6 monster while the Level 6 "[[Baegriller de Nouvellez]]" can Tribute the opponent's Attack Position monsters to Special Summon "[[Hungry Burger]]".

  The main goal of "Nouvellez" is to establish a quick chain of Special Summons in order to speed through making the higher Levels of Rituals in order to remove the opponent's field through powerful effects. Due to the ease at which the cards are able to be recurred, the theme is able to afford running lower numbers of their actual monsters and going for various engines and tech cards.

  "Nouvellez" monsters are also supported by the "[[Recipe]]" cards, an archetype that helps establish board presence and interrupt the opponent's plays.
