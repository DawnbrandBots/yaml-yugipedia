  "'''Scareclaw'''" (スケアクロー ''Sukeakurō'') is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Dimension Force]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 02: The New Broken Worlds}}

  ==Etymology==
  The Japanese names of "[[Primitive Planet Reichphobia]]" and "Scareclaw" [[Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s contain the kanji ''Shisekai'' ({{Ruby|肆|し}}{{Ruby|世|せ}}{{Ruby|壊|かい}}, lit. "Fourth Broken World"). The kanji is composed of ''shi'' ({{Ruby|肆|し}}, "four" in [[wikipedia:Japanese_numerals#Formal_numbers|daiji]] form), and the word ''sekai'' ({{Ruby|世|せ}}{{Ruby|壊|かい}}, lit. "World Destruction", homophone with {{Ruby|世|せ}}{{Ruby|界|かい}} "World" but replacing {{Ruby|界|かい}} "world" with the homophonous {{Ruby|壊|かい}} "break/destruction"), which is also found in the Japanese kanji name of "[[Clear New World]]" ({{Ruby|新|しん}}{{Ruby|世|せ}}{{Ruby|壊|かい}},  ''Shinsekai'', lit. "New Broken World").

  The "Scareclaw" Spell/Traps apply alternative ''kana'' readings to {{Ruby|肆|し}}{{Ruby|世|せ}}{{Ruby|壊|かい}}, while "[[Primitive Planet Reichphobia]]" has the word read phonetically.
  Each [[Level]] 3 "Scareclaw" monster is based on a [[wikipedia:Phobia|phobia]], which is reflected in their names and artworks.

  ==Design==
  ===Members===
  Except for "[[Scareclaw Reichheart]]", all Main Deck "Scareclaw" monsters are [[EARTH]] [[Beast]] monsters. The [[Link Monster]]s are all [[DARK]] [[Beast-Warrior]] monsters.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Scareclaw" archetype is centered around primarily [[Level]] 3 [[Beast]] monsters and quickly Summoning them to the Field as well as controlling the board state through their boss monster, "[[Scareclaw Tri-Heart]]", and its [[Effect|effect]] to force all other monsters on the [[field]] into [[Defense Position]]. The [[Main Deck]] members of the archetype help to facilitate this through various ways of [[Special Summon]]ing them from the hand as well as and giving effects to "Scareclaw" monsters in the [[Extra Monster Zone]], such as [[Piercing|piercing battle damage]], attacking multiple monsters in a single turn, and gaining [[ATK]]. This allows "Scareclaw Tri-Heart" to become a powerful monster able to attack multiple times per Battle Phase with high ATK values and piercing battle damage on top of this.
  As a secondary support to the theme, there is the monster "[[Visas Starfrost]]", a Level 6 [[Tuner monster]] able to Special Summon itself from the hand by destroying a monster you control with a different Type and Attribute from itself. "Scareclaw" uses this card well due to the introduction of "[[Scareclaw Light-Heart]]", a Link-1 monster able to not only search the "Scareclaw" [[Field Spell Card]] "[[Primitive Planet Reichphobia]]" but also be able to resummon itself from the GY if you control a "Visas Starfrost". This makes "Light-Heart" a great target to destroy with Visas's effect. Alongside this, Visas enables the use of [[Synchro Monster]]s in "Scareclaw" through being able to make Level 9 and 10 Synchro Monsters.
