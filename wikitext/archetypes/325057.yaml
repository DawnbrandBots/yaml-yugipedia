  "'''Nekroz'''" ({{Ruby|影霊衣|ネクロス}} ''Nekurosu'') is a [[Ritual Summon]]-based [[archetype]] comprised primarily of [[WATER]] monsters that debuted in ''[[Booster SP: Tribe Force]]'' with further support in ''[[Secrets of Eternity]]''. 
  ==Lore==
  {{Main|Master Guide 5 card storylines}}
  ''They're a clan that perfected magical [[Ritual Summon|rituals]] to weave the power of legendary monsters into armors via a [[Nekroz Mirror|magical mirror]], and clad themselves into them. This power allows them to even control the power of the "[[Ice Barrier]] [[Dragon]]s".''<ref>[http://www.ygorganization.com/weaselstamersmagicarmorandinfernorobotsohmy/ The Organization] - New Duel Terminal World Lores</ref>
  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  The "Nekroz" non-Ritual monsters are aged versions of established characters from earlier acts in the ''[[Duel Terminal]]'' storyline, associated with the "[[Gishki]]" and/or "[[Ice Barrier]]" archetypes.

  The "Nekroz" Ritual and Pendulum Monsters are the "Nekroz" non-Ritual Monsters wearing armor based on monsters from ''[[Duel Terminal]]'' archetypes (usually Synchro Monsters), including "[[Ice Barrier]]", "[[Mist Valley]]", "[[Ally of Justice]]", "[[Dragunity]]" and "[[Fabled]]". Their effects, Levels, and stat lines are often similar to their original counterparts' effects. They share their Types as their original counterparts.

  ===Etymology===
  "Nekroz" is a portmanteau of "necro" and "cloth/cross" ("Kurosu" can be translated to both words, both which fit the archetype's theme) refering to the armors (cloth/cross) based on legendary monsters (necro).
  In their Japanese names, the kanji characters that the "Nekroz" reading is applied to, "影霊衣", literally means "Shadow Spirit Clothing".
  ==Playing style==
  "Nekroz" is an archetype focused on Ritual Summoning. The non-Ritual Monsters serve as conventional ritual support, [[Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz|fulfilling tribute requirements]] and/or [[Great Sorcerer of the Nekroz|fetching key cards]] to maintain consistency. The non-Ritual, non-Pendulum "Nekroz" monsters also have advantageous effects that are triggered when they are Tributed by a card effect, offsetting the costs of Ritual Summoning.

  ! Nekroz !! Tribute effect
  |-
  | [[Great Sorcerer of the Nekroz|Great Sorcerer]] || Adds 1 Spellcaster "Nekroz" Ritual Monster from Deck to hand.
  |-
  | [[Dance Princess of the Nekroz|Dance Princess]] || Adds 1 banished "Nekroz" monster, except "Dance Princess", to hand.
  |-
  | [[Ariel, Priestess of the Nekroz|Ariel]] || Adds 1 non-Ritual "Nekroz" monster from Deck to hand.
  |-
  | [[Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz|Shurit]] || Adds 1 Warrior "Nekroz" Ritual Monster from Deck to hand.
  |-
  | [[Exa, Enforcer of the Nekroz|Exa]] || Adds 1 Dragon "Nekroz" Ritual Monster from Deck to hand.
  |}
  "Nekroz" Ritual Monsters have Levels ranging from 3 to 11. The effects of those ones with Level from 3 to 6 are used to suppress monsters Summoned from the Extra Deck, while the effects of those ones whose Levels range from 7 to 11 give to the player more card advantage, mainly by destroying and/or banishing other cards. In addition, all of them feature a second ability that can be activated by discarding them; these effects range from protecting and empowering on-field "Nekroz" monsters to reviving them and searching for resources. This remarkable property alleviates the recurring problem with Ritual monsters becoming [[dead draw]]s when the player does not have means of Ritual Summoning them. In addition, the discard-based effects of those ones with Level from 3 to 6 are [[Spell Speed 1]], while the ones with Level 7 and above can be activated during either player's turn. 
  The archetype's Ritual Monsters are all [[Nomi]] monsters that can only be Special Summoned by Ritual Summon. Additionally, all of them, save for the Levels 3-4  "[[Nekroz of Clausolas|Clausolas]]" and "[[Nekroz of Unicore|Unicore]]", have restrictions or requirements for the Tributes (or equivalent monster costs) used for their Ritual Summons:
  * Levels 5-6 ("[[Nekroz of Catastor|Catastor]]", "[[Nekroz of Brionac|Brionac]]"): Must be Ritual Summoned without using other copies of themselves.
  * Levels 7-10 ("[[Nekroz of Gungnir|Gungnir]]", "[[Nekroz of Valkyrus|Valkyrus]]", "[[Nekroz of Trishula|Trishula]]", "[[Nekroz of Areadbhair|Areadbhair]]", "[[Nekroz of Decisive Armor|Decisive Armor]]"): Must be Ritual Summoned without using monsters that share the same Levels as them.
  * Level 11 ("[[Nekroz of Sophia|Sophia]]"): Must be Ritual Summoned from the hand, by Tributing 3 monsters on the field with different Types.

  |}
  Their Ritual Spell Cards are very flexible and have additional effects and conditions that help to achieve the requirements of the Ritual Summons:
  * "[[Nekroz Mirror]]" can banish "Nekroz" monsters from the Graveyard as part of the Tributes needed for the Ritual Summon;
  * "[[Nekroz Kaleidoscope]]" is a unique Ritual Spell Card, that can be used to Ritual Summon '''''any number''''' of "Nekroz" Ritual Monsters, and can send, from the Extra Deck, a monster whose Level is the same as the total Levels of the intended Ritual Monsters; this versatility helps to maintain card advantage by keeping the monsters on the field and/or hand intact;
  * "[[Nekroz Cycle]]" can Ritual Summon a "Nekroz" monster from the Graveyard, and is the first Ritual Spell that can do so.
  Each of them also have a second effect that lets the player banish it and a "Nekroz" monster from the Graveyard in order to search for any "Nekroz" Spell Card, provided its owner controls no monsters.

  }}
  ===Weaknesses===
  * The main threat to the "Nekroz" strategy are cards that lock its owner's Deck from searching effects, such as "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" and mainly "[[Mistake]]". This counter-strategy is especially threatening because it can single-handedly shut down the effects of "Clausolas", "Brionac", "Shurit", "[[Reinforcement of the Army]]", "[[Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands]]", "[[Senju of the Thousand Hands]]", "[[Preparation of Rites]]", and the second effect of their Ritual Spells.
  ** One can also use "[[Shared Ride]]" to take advantage of their many searching effects and gain a strong hand advantage.
  * "Nekroz" Ritual Monsters are also vulnerable to effects that shut down in-hand effects, such as "[[Mind Drain]]", "[[Debunk]]", etc. "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" can lock the Graveyard from the effect of the Ritual Spell Cards and the effects of "Valkyrus", "Trishula" and "Decisive Armor". 
  * "Nekroz" archetypes rely entirely on [[Special Summon]]ing, so "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]", "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", or even their own "[[Djinn Releaser of Rituals]]" (in mirror matches) can detain the deck for a while. 
  * "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" is also very powerful, since it will banish any Tributes for the Ritual Summons while also banishing the Ritual Spell Cards themselves after their resolve, making the Deck run out of resources in the long run. It also banishes a random card from the hand after a searching effect resolves, potentially crippling the "Nekroz" strategy.
  ** Any decks that can utilize "[[Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk]]" can use it to banish the Ritual Spells from the Graveyard, preventing them from adding a new one from the Deck to the hand with their effects.
  * Cards that negate the effects of Spell Cards, such as "[[Naturia Beast]]" and "[[Spell Canceller]]", are also major threats to this deck as they stop the deck from Special Summoning any of its Ritual Monsters (albeit they can be easily mitigated with the monster effect of "[[Zefrasaber, Swordmaster of the Nekroz|Zefrasaber]]").
  * "[[El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis]]" stops "Nekroz" decks in their tracks as its effect forbids any Special Summoning from the hand or Graveyard with Spell or Trap effects, essentially making all three of their Ritual Spells useless in the hand.
  * "Virus" cards such as "[[Crush Card Virus]]" and "[[Deck Devastation Virus]]" will work well against them due to the fact they must discard monsters from the hand and destroy the ones they control on the field. Using "[[Eradicator Epidemic Virus]]" and declaring "Spell Cards" can rid their hand of any Ritual Spells they may have, and send any other Ritual Spells they may draw to the Graveyard.
  ==Trivia==
  * "[[Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz]]", "[[Great Sorcerer of the Nekroz]]", and "[[Exa, Enforcer of the Nekroz]]", are usually featured in the artworks of "Nekroz" Ritual Monsters whose Levels are divisible by their own Levels: 3, 4, and 5 respectively, the only exception being "[[Nekroz of Areadbhair]]" (10) for Shurit. "[[Dance Princess of the Nekroz]]" on the other hand, appears in the artworks of "Nekroz" Ritual Monsters whose Levels are prime numbers.
  * It seems that the "Nekroz" armors have an innate ability to affect its wearer's age; the higher their Level, the older they become, and vice-versa.
  ** In Shurit's case, he's at his oldest when he wears the armor of "Areadbhair", as evidenced by "[[Nekroz of Areadbhair]]" having the highest Level (10) among his Ritual Monster forms.
  ** In Great Sorcerer's case, he's at his youngest when he wears Unicore's armor, as evidenced by "[[Nekroz of Unicore]]" having the lowest Level (4) among his Ritual Monster forms.
  ** Despite this, it seems that "[[Dance Princess of the Nekroz]]" and "[[Exa, Enforcer of the Nekroz]]" are unaffected by this phenomenon for some unknown reason, although Exa's body mass does appear to increase in his Ritual forms, with "[[Nekroz of Decisive Armor]]" featuring an especially bulky Exa.
  * Despite "[[Nekroz of Clausolas]]" listing a "Nekroz" Spell/Trap in its text, currently there are no "Nekroz" Trap Cards.
