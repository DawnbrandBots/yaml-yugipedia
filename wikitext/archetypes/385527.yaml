  "'''Magician Girl'''" (マジシャン・ガール ''Majishan Gāru'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]], including the [[Dark Magician Girl (archetype)|"Dark Magician Girl" sub-archetype]]. They are based on "[[Dark Magician Girl]]", the archetype's very first member. There are six "Magician Girls", each with a different [[Attribute]] as well as a [[Level]] from 1 to 6. Members have existed since the [[Battle City]] arc of the original series, but had no support until the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions Movie Pack]]''.
  The first letters in the names of the flavor "Magician Girl" cards in the order of their Levels spell the word "Black", a reference to the Japanese name of "Dark Magician Girl": "Black Magician Girl".
  ==Members==
  "Magician Girl" monsters each have an [[Monster effect|effect]] that either [[Special Summon]]s monsters or boosts the [[ATK]]/[[DEF]] of monsters.
  ===Summoning effects===
  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Magician Girl !! Summoned target
  |-
  | [[Apple Magician Girl|Apple]] || 1 Level 5 or lower Spellcaster monster from your hand
  |-
  | [[Berry Magician Girl|Berry]] || 1 "Magician Girl" monster from your Deck, except "Berry Magician Girl"
  |-
  | [[Chocolate Magician Girl|Chocolate]] || 1 Spellcaster monster from your Graveyard, except "Chocolate Magician Girl"
  |-
  | [[Lemon Magician Girl|Lemon]] || 1 Spellcaster monster from your hand, but its effects (if any) are negated
  |}
  ===Boosting effects===
  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Magician Girl !! ATK/DEF boost
  |-
  | [[Dark Magician Girl|Dark]] || 300 ATK to itself for each "Dark Magician" or "Magician of Black Chaos" in the Graveyards
  |-
  | [[Kiwi Magician Girl|Kiwi]] || 300 ATK and DEF to all "Magician Girl" monsters you currently control for each "Magician Girl" monster with a different name on the field or in the Graveyards until the end of the turn it is discarded by its effect
  |}
  ==Playing style==
  The "Magician Girl" monsters' main feature is Special Summoning [[Spellcaster]] monsters from the player's hand or Graveyard when they are selected as attack targets, redirecting the attack to the Special Summoned monster while halving the attacking monster's ATK. This ability, together with cards like "[[Magical Dimension]]" and "[[Dark Renewal]]", allows them to easily Summon high-Level Spellcaster monsters. 
  With the multiple cards that cross-support "[[Dark Magician]]" and "[[Dark Magician Girl]]", and the multiple Special Summoning effects "Magician Girl" monsters have, "Dark Magician" becomes a tech option for the Deck.
  Since the effects of the "Magician Girls" only trigger when they are selected as attack targets, the theme may become somewhat slow. Because of that, cards that force attacks like "[[Battle Mania]]", "[[All-Out Attacks]]", "[[Savage Colosseum]]" and "[[Yang Zing Unleashed]]" also become an interesting tech option to the Deck.
