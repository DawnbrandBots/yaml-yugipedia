  "'''Prophecy'''", known as "'''Magical'''" ({{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|導|どう}} ''Madō'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with [[effect]]s based around "[[Spellbook]]" [[Spell Card]]s. It is supported exclusively by "[[Stoic of Prophecy]]".

  "[[Hierophant of Prophecy (anime)|Hierophant of Prophecy]]" is used by [[Kev Ravenwood]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime.

  ==Naming==
  Due to their Japanese names containing {{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|導|どう}}, a number of older cards, such as "[[Armor Exe]]" ("Magical Armor Exe") and "[[Dark Paladin]]" ("Super-Magical Swordsman - Black Paladin"), also fall into this archetype. Even some cards released after "Stoic of Prophecy", such as "[[Ebon Illusion Magician]]", that fall into this archetype do not include "Prophecy" in their English names. However, because ''TCG'' and ''OCG'' support for this archetype only works on [[Level 3 Monster Cards]] in the [[Main Deck]], most do not qualify for it and lack synergy with the Deck.

  Each "Spellbook"-related "Prophecy" monster is based on a [[wikipedia:Tarot|Tarot]] card of the [[wikipedia:Major Arcana|Major Arcana]]. "[[Crowley, the First Propheseer]]" being the "creator" of the "Prophecy" monsters shows that they're based on the [[wikipedia:Thoth tarot deck|Thoth tarot deck]]. The English names come from the [[wikipedia:Rider-Waite tarot deck|Rider-Waite tarot deck]] which uses the names "The High Priestess" and "The Hierophant" instead of "The Popesse" and "The Pope" which is found in other decks. The Japanese names of these "Prophecy" monsters make reference to French-language tarot decks.

  ==Playing style==
  The archetype focuses on Spellcaster monsters and the effects and presence of "Spellbook" Spell Cards. "Spellbook" cards focus on creating advantage, like raising a monster's ATK ("[[Spellbook of Power]]"), protecting monsters ("[[Spellbook of Wisdom]]"), or Xyz Summoning ("[[Spellbook of Life]]"), and manipulating the amount on the field, in the hand and in the [[Graveyard]] to activate effects.

  ===Weakness===
  The "Prophecy" archetype is overall so diverse in terms of monster stats (minus their Type) and strategies that it's almost impossible if at all to ''completely'' render this Deck moot as well-built "Prophecy" Decks can be very resilient and multi-faceted in terms of play strategies.  However, there ''are'' some cards that can deter these kind of Decks:

  * "[[Spell Canceller]]", "[[Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell]]", "[[Morphing Jar 2]]" and/or "[[Eradicator Epidemic Virus]]" - Can deadlock "Spellbook" Spells from being played, however the first may also lock your own Deck. The second could be a temporary reprieve if you run a good amount of Spells, but may backlash against you if your opponent gets monsters out, which well-built "Prophecy" Decks will have a diverse way of doing so.  The third may often rely on chance, yet if your opponent lacks monsters in their Deck or better yet have used most of them along with having a lot of them on the Field, it could severely Deck your opponent out.  The last card does not stay on the Field and forces your opponent to reveal every card they draw for a few turns, but not every Deck will be able to use it either at all or very easily, given its pre-effect [[Cost]].

  * "[[Spell Shattering Arrow]]" - While more [[staple]] S/T removal (i.e. "[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]") can also be temporary alleviators against "Prophecy" Decks too, this card in particular can be harshly judgmental by not only wiping [[Spell Card]]s ''en masse'' at no cost to the user, but also inflicting hefty damage as well.

  * "[[Attention!]]" and/or "[[Unification]]" + "[[Gozen Match]]" and/or "[[Battle of the Elements]]" - These two pairs of cards go hand-in-hand as "Prophecy" monsters have a diverse range of Levels and Attributes.  Even if that's not the case "Prophecy" monsters like "[[High Priestess of Prophecy]]" and "[[Hierophant of Prophecy]]" can quickly clear the field of these deterrents

  * "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]", "[[Prohibition]]" and/or "[[Psi-Blocker]]" - Can stop many Spellbook-theme cards: "Spellbook of Judgment", "Spellbook Library of the Heliosphere", "Spellbook Star Hall", "Spellbook of Power", "Spellbook of Secrets", and "The Grand Spellbook Tower" as well as key "Prophecy" monsters from being used.  Again though, these "one-card armies" can be easily put down, especially in the current meta, which has focused more on Field control.

  * "[[Deck Lockdown]]" and/or  "[[Mistake]]" plus/minus "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" - "Prophecy" Decks often times substantially rely on [[Toolbox]] tactics to add "Prophecy" monsters and "Spellbook" Spells from the Deck to the [[Hand]] to keep Hand resources and play options motley. That being said, these cards can extensively make [[Hand advantage]] much more sluggish by making Toolbox card effects useless.

  * "[[Puppet Plant]]" - This card can flich a high-powered "Prophecy" monster in a pinch; it's not as easy to interdict unless it is discarded beforehand or if "[[Mind Drain]]" is used.  Better yet, the monster can afterwards be either Tributed, used for an effect or even as Synchro or Xyz Material (i.e. with Xyz Summons, use two of this card to embezzle two "High Priestess of Prophecy"s and then Xyz Summon "[[Number 11: Big Eye]]" (in the [[TCG]]) or "[[Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack]]").

  ==Trivia==
  * "Spellbook"-related "Prophecy" monsters share the trait of being based on Tarot cards with the "[[Arcana Force]]" [[archetype]].
  * "Spellbook"-related "Prophecy" monsters' Attributes seem to be linked with their Levels: WATER (Levels 1-2), EARTH (Level 3), WIND/FIRE (Level 4), DARK (Levels 5-6, 8), LIGHT (Level 7, 9).
  * All "Spellbook"-related "Prophecy" monsters (except "Prophecy Destroyer") wear long flowing ribbons or sashes that feature magical runes on them.
  * All "Spellbook"-related "Prophecy" monsters, as well as the "Spellbooks" themselves, feature the mirror-like crest of the "Prophecy" archetype.
  * Several "Prophecy" monsters share the same ATK/DEF as some of [[Yugi Muto]]'s signature monsters.
