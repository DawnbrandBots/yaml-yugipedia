  "'''Gadget'''" (ガジェット ''Gajetto'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] (with the exception of the [[Cyberse]] "[[Cyberse Gadget]]" and "[[Gadget Token]]").
  The primary "Gadget" monsters and their support focus on generic Machine support, fast Summoning and swarming, and are centred around the cards "[[Green Gadget]]", "[[Red Gadget]]", and "[[Yellow Gadget]]", used by [[Yugi Muto]]. These Gadgets also synergise strongly with the "[[Ancient Gear]]" archetype, due to several members of the latter archetype directly supporting the colored Gadgets or Gadgets in general. There is also a smaller group of "Gadget" monsters that support the "[[Morphtronic]]" archetype, and are used by [[Leo]] in the anime, as well as a few others which do not belong to either group.

  ==Playing style==
  The Gadget archetype serves as a means to bring out typically larger monsters such as "[[Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon]]", "[[Powerhold the Moving Battery]]" (An arguably improved "[[Stronghold the Moving Fortress]]") Or their own credited boss Monster, "[[Boot-Up Admiral - Destroyer Dynamo]]". At one point in competitive play, They were used as fodder for "[[Machina Fortress]]". Besides this all Gadgets are Level 4, granting them access to a large amount of [[Rank]] 4 [[Xyz Monster]]s. Gadgets tend to search more Gadgets from the [[Deck]] when summoned or destroyed, with the newer [[LIGHT]] Gadgets having effects to [[Special Summon]] other [[Machine]]s from the hand. [[Ancient Gear Gadget]] can change its name to become any other Gadget, which is useful for cards that want "[[Red Gadget|Red]]", "[[Green Gadget|Green]]" or "[[Yellow Gadget]]" such as [[Ancient Gear Gadjiltron Chimera]]. New Gadget support cards such as [[Boot-Up Corporal - Command Dynamo]] focus on [[Equip]]ing Gadgets to themselves to boost their attack while [[Boot-Up Order - Gear Charge]] Special Summons Equipped Gadgets.

  ===Weakness===
  This deck struggles to recover against "[[System Down]]" and being mostly Machine focused, "[[There Can Be Only One]]" which also won't [[Destroy]] "Silver" or "Gold Gadget" for their effects to trigger. The high-attack [[Trap Monster]]s can also be removed with "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]" and "[[Harpie's Feather Duster]]".
