  "'''Gold Pride'''" ({{Ruby|ＧＰ|ゴールド・プライド}} ''Gōrudo Puraido'') is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Photon Hypernova]]''.
  == Etymology ==
  "Gold Pride" is the name given to the race in which the various monsters of the archetype participate in. It shares its initialism with ''[[wikipedia:Grand Prix|Grand Prix]]'', a common name used by motorsport competitions.

  == Design ==
  The "Gold Pride" archetype is themed as a sci-fi-styled racing event where contestants of different humanoid races race using different custom "vehicles".

  "Gold Pride" monsters are made up Main Deck contestants and their Extra Deck "vehicles", their diverse backgrounds being represented by by none of them sharing the same [[Type]] and [[Attribute]]. Their shared [[Special Summon]] condition could also be seen as coming from behind in a race.

  Each "Gold Pride" Main Deck monster corresponds to a "Gold Pride" Extra Deck monster, with each being of a different [[monster card type]].

  == Playing style ==
  "Gold Pride" is an archetype centered around having less Life Points than the opponent in order to [[Special Summon]] its [[Main Deck]] monsters from the hand and generate various means of advantage. Each Main Deck Monster in the archetype generates a different advantage from adding cards to the hand, to providing extra means of disruption, to speedily summoning their various archetypal Extra Deck monsters.

  "[[Gold Pride - Leon|Leon]]" is the Deck's main combo enabler for Extra Deck plays, able to swarm multiple monsters to the field by its revival effect as well as perform various Synchro Summons during both players' turns for Level 6, 8, and 11 Synchro Monsters as well as some Rank 3 Xyz Summons. Especially of note is "[[Gold Pride - Star Leon|Star Leon]]", which is able to remove problem cards from the field and gain immense ATK stats to secure victories.

  In terms of disruption and field extension, there are "[[Gold Pride - Nytro Head|Nytro Head]]" and "[[Gold Pride - Roller Baller|Roller Baller]]". Nytro Head specifically functions as both an extra extender as well as a field-controlling endboard monster itself through it's effect to Summon a Token to the opponent's field and destroy it along with other cards while Pin Baller is able to quickly Fusion Summon "[[Gold Pride - Pin Baller|Pin Baller]]", which is able to attach monsters to itself as Equip Cards up to the number of Fusion Materials used to summon it.

  Each "Gold Pride" [[Extra Deck]] monster has an effect that mandatorily triggers at the [[End Phase]] if the player uses their primary effect during the turn, which has them return themselves from the field to the Extra Deck and Special Summon their corresponding "Gold Pride" monster from the Deck or GY.

  "Gold Pride" Spell & Trap support (with the Traps being searchable by "[[Gold Pride - Captain Carrie|Captain Carrie]]" and Spells being searchable by "[[Gold Pride - Chariot Carrie|Chariot Carrie]]") provide additional swarming, interruption, and utility.
  Externally, the archetype has good synergy with the [[P.U.N.K.]] archetype, which requires [[pay]]ing LP to activate their effects (thereby enabling the effects of "Gold Pride" monsters) and synergizes with the Deck's use of Synchro Summoning.
