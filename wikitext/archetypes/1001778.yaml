  "'''Valmonica'''" (ヴァルモニカ ''Varumonika'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Fiend]] and [[Fairy]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Valiant Smashers]]''.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  ==Playing style==
  "Valmonica" is a theme that revolves around manipulation of the user's Life Point in tangent with it's two main [[Pendulum Monster]]s, "[[Angelo Valmonica]]" and "[[Demone Valmonica]]", specifically their  [[Pendulum Effect]] to gain "Resonance Counters" when gaining LP in the case of "Angelo" and taking damage for "Demone". Once 3 or more "Resonance Counters" have been gained on a respective [[Pendulum Scale]], the player can proceed to [[Link Summon]] the theme's 2 boss monsters; "[[Divine Oddity of Valmonica - Zebufera]]" and "[[Odd Deity of Valmonica - Giurarme]]", a duo of stronger monsters limited merely through the condition to summon them.
