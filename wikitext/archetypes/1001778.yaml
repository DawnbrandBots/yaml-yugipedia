  "'''Valmonica'''" (ヴァルモニカ ''Varumonika'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Fiend]] and [[Fairy]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Valiant Smashers]]''.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===


  ==Playing style==
  "Valmonica" is a theme centered on gaining "Resonance Counters", a type of [[Counter]] obtained through the [[Pendulum Effect]] of the archetype's [[Pendulum Monster]]s by gaining Life Points and taking [[Effect damage]]. Once 3 "Resonance Counters" have been gained on a respective [[Pendulum Scale]], the player can [[Link Summon]] the theme's 2 boss monsters; "[[Divine Oddity of Valmonica - Zebufera]]" and "[[Odd Deity of Valmonica - Giurarme]]".
