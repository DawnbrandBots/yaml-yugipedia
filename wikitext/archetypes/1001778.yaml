  "'''Valmonica'''" (ヴァルモニカ ''Varumonika'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Fiend]] and [[Fairy]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Valiant Smashers]]''.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  "[[Angelo Valmonica]]" and "[[Demone Valmonica]]" are based on the concept of a "[[wikipedia:Shoulder angel|shoulder angel and devil]]", a dramatic interpretation and visualization of one's individual [[wikipedia:Conscience|conscience]] that drives them to make morally good or evil decisions and symbolize the inner struggle of a person's choices.

  ==Playing style==
  "Valmonica" is a theme that revolves around manipulation of the user's Life Point in tandem with its two [[Pendulum Monster]]s, "[[Angelo Valmonica]]" and "[[Demone Valmonica]]", specifically their [[Pendulum Effect]]s to gain [[Resonance Counter]]s when gaining LP (in the case of "Angelo") and taking damage (for "Demone"). Once 3 or more "Resonance Counters" have been gained on a respective [[Pendulum Scale]], the player can proceed to [[Link Summon]] the theme's 2 boss monsters; "[[Divine Oddity of Valmonica - Zebufera]]" and "[[Odd Deity of Valmonica - Giurarme]]", a duo of stronger monsters limited merely through this condition to Summon them.
