  "'''Ultimate Crystal'''", known as "'''Ultimate Gem God'''" ({{Ruby|究|きゅう}}{{Ruby|極|きょく}}{{Ruby|宝|ほう}}{{Ruby|玉|ぎょく}}{{Ruby|神|しん}} ''Kyūkyoku Hōgyokushin'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Dragon]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Jesse Anderson]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime that [[support]]s the "[[Crystal Beast]]" archetype. This archetype is a sub-archetype of the "[[Crystal]]" archetype.

  In the ''TCG'', prior to the release of "[[Ultimate Crystal Rainbow Dragon Overdrive]]" in "[[Structure Deck: Legend of the Crystal Beasts]]," none of the members of this archetype had the archetype as part of their name, instead using [[archetype condition]]s to indicate membership. This is because, for over ten years, this archetype's only two members were "[[Rainbow Dragon]]" and "[[Rainbow Dark Dragon]]", and all support for the archetype referenced those two specific cards by name. When "[[Rainbow Overdragon]]", the first new member of this archetype, was released in the ''TCG'', the original two members and "Overdragon" were given an archetype condition stating that they were always treated as "Ultimate Crystal" monsters. All support for the archetype subsequently received errata appropriately (except "[[Rainbow Path]]", but since it only affects "Ultimate Crystal" monsters in the Main Deck, and all newer "Ultimate Crystal" monsters are Extra Deck monsters, this does not make a difference).
