  "'''Laundsallyn'''", known as "'''Lancelot'''" (ランスロット ''Ransurotto'') in the ''[[OCG]]'' and English anime and manga, is a small [[archetype]] consisting of monsters that represent [[wikipedia:Lancelot|Sir Lancelot]]. It was first introduced in the ''[[TCG]]'' version of ''[[Abyss Rising]]'', but received its first support in the ''TCG'' version of ''[[Primal Origin]]'' with the release of "[[Avalon]]".
  Due to its Japanese name, "[[Number 23: Lancelot, Dark Knight of the Underworld]]" also falls into this archetype. However, because ''[[TCG]]'' and ''[[OCG]]'' support for this archetype only works on "Laundsallyn" monsters that are also "[[Noble Knight]]" monsters, this is not an issue.
