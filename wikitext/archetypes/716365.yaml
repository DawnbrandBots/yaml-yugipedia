  "'''Rainbow Bridge'''", known as "'''Bridge'''" ({{Ruby|架|か}}け{{Ruby|橋|はし}} ''Kakehashi'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] that supports the "[[Crystal]]" archetypes.

  == Playing style ==
  {{See also|Crystal Beast#Playing style}}

  The "Rainbow Bridge" cards primarily excel at providing card advantage for "Crystal Beast" Decks in searching the necessary "Crystal" Spells/Traps which can subsequently support "Crystal Beast" monsters. "[[Rainbow Bridge]]" is a [[Normal Spell Card|Normal Spell]] that simply searches any "Crystal" Spell/Trap. "[[Rainbow Bridge of the Heart]]" is a [[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous Spell]] that can also search any "Crystal" Spell/Trap by destroying a "Crystal Beast" card, but it also allows an additional Normal Summon of a "Crystal Beast" monster and can bounce an opponent's card along with itself to the hand whenever a "Crystal Beast" card is placed in the Spell & Trap Zone, serving as another piece of disruption. Finally, "[[Rainbow Bridge of Salvation]]" is a [[Normal Trap Card|Normal Trap]] with a niche field-resetting effect that is difficult to fulfill but its more useful secondary effect in the GY can search any [[Field Spell Card|Field Spell]] and a "Crystal Beast" monster.

  "Rainbow Bridge" cards are directly supported by "[[Awakening of the Crystal Ultimates]]" which can search or mill "Rainbow Bridge" cards.
