  "'''Exosister'''" (エクソシスター ''Ekusoshisutā''), introduced in "[[Deck Build Pack: Grand Creators]]", is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Spellcaster]]/[[Warrior]] monsters which focuses on [[Xyz Summon]]ing and dealing with [[GY]]-related mechanics.
  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines#No. 04: Exosister}}
  ==Etymology==
  The archetype's name is a portmanteau of "[[wikipedia:Exorcist|exorcist]]" and "sister", a form of address for fellow female members of a religious order such as nuns. The Main Deck members use western female given names, with their corresponding Xyz forms combining their names with those of [[wikipedia:archangel|archangel]]s.

  ==Design==
  [[File:Crest-Exosister.png|thumb|left|100px|The "Exosister" crest.]]
  The "Sister" forms of each member, represented by the [[Main Deck]] [[Spellcaster]] monsters, are wearing dark military-style uniforms. The "Exorcist" forms of each member, represented by the [[Warrior]] [[Xyz Monster]]s, are wearing modified white versions of their respective uniforms. Their weapons varies within a wide range of weaponry, from swords and spears to compound bows and rifles. Outside Japan, the dresses of the "Exosister" monsters are recolored to a brighter shade.

  The shared effect of the "Sister" members to [[Special Summon]] an "Exosister" Xyz Monster represents their transformation into their "Exorcist" counterparts.
  The archetype's cards and card effects are associated with the number 800:
  * Each Main Deck "Exosister" monster has 800 DEF, and each Extra Deck monster has a DEF that ends in 800.
  * "[[Exosister Gibrine]]" increases the ATK of Xyz Monsters by 800.
  * Each Main Deck "Exosister" monster (except "[[Exosister Martha]]") has an effect to gain 800 LP.
  * Each "Exosister" Spell/Trap with an LP payment cost requires paying 800 LP.
  The Extra Deck "Exosister" monsters all have ribbons made of holy water covering parts of their bodies and weapons. These ribbons are in the shape of the number 8, possibly referencing their card effects that often involve 800 points. Wings made of holy water flank the sides of some ribbons, forming a close resemblance toward the "Exosister" crest.

  ===Members===
  Each Main Deck "Exosister" monster mentions the name of another Main Deck "Exosister" monster in its effect text; this forms two pairs of "Exosister" monsters where each member references their counterpart in their effect text, and an additional single-direction reference in "Martha".

  ==Playing style==
  "Exosister" is an [[Xyz Monster]]-based archetype focused on punishing the opponent for interacting with the [[Graveyard]]s, with conditional [[Trigger Effect]]s that allow the player to Xyz Summon monsters using only 1 "Exosister" monster.

  All "Exosister" Main Deck monsters have two effects: a shared 1-card-Xyz [[Trigger Effect]] that can be used if a card is moved out of a GY, and an individual effect.

  | [[Exosister Irene|Irene]]
  |-
  | [[Exosister Sophia|Sophia]]
  |-
  | [[Exosister Martha|Martha]]
  | [If <u>either player</u> moves a card out of either GY,]
  |}

  The shared 1-card-Xyz effect allows Main Deck "Exosister" monsters to immediately turn into Xyz boss monsters (see below) with disruptive or suppressive effects if the opponent moves any card out of either GY.

  The condition of "the opponent moving a card out of either GY" can be triggered by the opponent moving cards via a card's [[cost]], [[effect]], or [[Summoning condition]]s (e.g. "[[ABC-Dragon Buster]]"). The opponent must be involved in the action; if the "Exosister" monster's controller moves a card out of their opponent's GY (e.g.: with "[[D.D. Crow]]"), this effect will not trigger.

  |}

  Each Rank 4 "Exosister" Xyz Monster has 3 effects:
  * A [[Continuous Effect]] that protects against monsters Special Summoned from the GY
  * A [[Quick Effect]] or [[Trigger Effect]] that is usable if the card was Xyz Summoned this turn using an "Exosister" monster as material
  * An [[Ignition Effect]] with a cost of detaching 1 material.

  The Rank 8 "[[Exosisters Magnifica]]" requires 2 "Exosister" Rank 4 Xyz monsters to summon, and cannot be summoned by "Exosister" 1-card-Xyz effects. It has double attack, Quick Effect (non-targeting) banish, and Quick Effect 1-card-Xyz effects, making for a potent game finisher.

  "Exosister" Spell/Traps provide diverse removal, utility, and consistency options. "[[Exosister Pax|Pax]]" provides Spell Speed 2 searching and conditional special summoning. "[[Exosister Arment|Arment]]" provides a conditional Spell Speed 2 manual 1-card Xyz effect. "[[Exosister Carpedivem|Carpedivem]]" provides Continuous protection, conditional "[[Prohibition]]" effect, and S/T removal. "[[Exosister Vadis|Vadis]]" is a trap that special summons 2 "Exosister" monsters from Deck with return-to-deck restrictions, incentivizing the player to time the trap's activation correctly and immediately use the summoned monsters' effects to perform 1-card-Xyz summons. "[[Exosister Returnia|Returnia]]" provides targeted banish removal, and provides additional combo or removal if conditions are met.

  "Exosister" setup combos focus on swarming Level 4 Spellcaster monsters, in order to summon "[[Exosister Mikailis]]" and search for a S/T for use as disruption on the opponent's turn (typically "[[Exosister Returnia|Returnia]]"). If possible, the Deck will typically extend into another "Exosister" Xyz monster to then summon "[[Exosisters Magnifica]]" for more disruptions. "[[Exosister Martha]]", with its double summon effect, thus becomes central to the swarming strategy; it is searchable by "[[Exosister Kaspitell]]", so making a single "Kaspitell" guarantees the full combo of summoning "Mikailis" and then "Magnifica".
