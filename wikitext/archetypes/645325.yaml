  {{Quote|Face off against the [[Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity|final boss]]!|source=''TCG'' commercial for ''[[Mystic Fighters]]''}}
  "'''Generaider'''", known as "'''Generaid'''" (ジェネレイド ''Jenereido'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Mystic Fighters]]''. It is comprised of multiple [[Level]] 9 monsters of various [[Attribute]]s and [[Type]]s, and its playstyle revolves around [[swarm]]ing these Level 9 monsters using the effects of their Field Spell, "[[Generaider Boss Stage]]".
  ==Etymology==
  "Generaider" is a portmanteau of "general" and "raider". "General" refers to the archetype's theme of bosses accompanied by additional generic monsters. "Raider" refers to [[wikipedia:Raid (video games)|raids]] found in [[wikipedia:Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs)]], specifically raids based around boss fights.
  The kanji ''ō'' (王) used for the archetype's Japanese name means "king".
  ==Design==
  [[File:GeneraiderBossStage-MADU-EN-VG-artwork.png|left|thumb|150px|The "Generaider" crest in "[[Generaider Boss Stage]]"]]
  The "Generaider" archetype is based around the theme of [[wikipedia:Boss (video games)|boss fights]] from video games. The setting of the archetype is based on the [[wikipedia:Norse cosmology#Nine Worlds|Nine Worlds]] of [[wikipedia:Norse mythology|Norse mythology]], and the "Generaider" monsters have various origins from Norse mythology.

  The "[[Runick]]" Spell Cards, which are also based on Norse mythology and video games, are related to this archetype, as evidenced by "[[Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses]]" appearing in the artwork of "[[Runick Allure]]", and the same characters appearing in both "[[Generaider Boss Fight]]" and "[[Runick Dispelling]]".
  ===Members===
  The "Generaider Boss" monsters are [[Level]] 9, with the exception of the [[Rank]] 9 "[[Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity]]" and "[[Laevatein, Generaider Boss of Shadows]]". Each "Generaider Boss" monster is a different [[Type]], and the [[Main Deck]] monsters can use "Generaider" monsters and/or generic monsters of their respective Type as tribute to activate their effects.

  Each "Generaider Boss" monster corresponds with one of the nine stages displayed on the "Generaider" crest in "[[Generaider Boss Stage]]", which corresponds with the Nine World of Norse cosmology. Their Levels/Ranks are also a reference to the Nine Worlds.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Generaider" archetype's playstyle revolves around using their Field Spell, "[[Generaider Boss Stage]]", to summon "Generaider" monsters during the opponent's turn and swarm the field with tokens to enable their Quick Effect disruptions. Once per turn, "Generaider Boss Stage" can Special Summon 1 "Generaider" monster from the Deck if the opponent draws a card, including in the [[Draw Phase]], and then Special Summon as many "[[Generaider Token]]s" as possible. These tokens are temporary and will be destroyed in the End Phase, and are meant as tribute fodder to supply the costs for the "Generaider" monsters' [[Quick Effect]]s.

  The "Generaider" archetype includes nine Level 9 Main Deck monsters, one Level 4 Main Deck monster, "[[Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses|Loptr]]", and two Rank 9 Xyz monsters, "[[Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity|Jormungandr]]" and "[[Laevatein, Generaider Boss of Shadows|Laevatein]]". All "Generaider" monsters have a [[Control only one|side-unique]] condition.

  All "Generaider" monsters have [[Quick Effect]]s or analogous effects usable in both player's turns, with costs that involve destroying/tributing 1 or more "Generaider" monster(s), and/or monsters with the same Type as themselves.

  "[[Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses|Loptr]]", the archetype's sole Level 4 monster, and consequently the only "Generaider" monster that can be Normal Summoned without Tributes, is the deck's starter and play enabler. "Loptr" has the Quick Effect to Tribute 1 "Generaider" monster to Special Summon 1 Level 9 "Generaider" monster with a different name from the Deck. Without "Generaider Boss Stage", "Loptr" can be used to Special Summon "Mardel", who will search out "Boss Stage"; in the opponent's turn, "Loptr" can be used to strategically summon "Generaider" monsters to counter the opponent's plays.

  The deck can easily swarm Level 9 monsters, which can in turn be used to make powerful Rank 9 Xyz Monsters and/or Link Monsters that need high-level Link Materials; examples include the boss monsters of the deck, the Rank 9 "[[Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity]]" and "[[Laevatein, Generaider Boss of Shadows]]", as well as the Rank 9 "[[True King of All Calamities]]", and even "[[World Gears of Theurlogical Demiurgy]]".

  Notably, several "Generaider" cards, including "[[Frodi, Generaider Boss of Swords|Frodi]]", "[[Generaider Boss Fight|Boss Fight]]", "[[Generaider Boss Loot|Boss Loot]]", "[[Generaider Boss Room|Boss Room]]", and "[[Jormungandr, Generaider Boss of Eternity|Jormungandr]]", have effects that cause the opponent to draw cards. Though this is a negative effect, some "Generaider" cards can trigger beneficial effects from it:
  * "Generaider Boss Stage" can Special Summon a "Generaider" monster from the Deck when the opponent draws a card, compensating for the draw if it was made during the player's turn.
  * "[[Harr, Generaider Boss of Storms]]" can force the opponent to send 1 monster from their hand or field to the GY if they draw cards outside of their Draw Phase.
  Due to their effect that also works with their corresponding Types, individual "Generaider" monsters can also be used in other Type-based decks to supplement their strategy. Such as "Hera, Generaider Boss of Doom" who can be used to supplement a [[Zombie]]-oriented strategy.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * The archetype is extremely reliant on its Field Spell, and is almost completely paralyzed without it. Cards that can remove the Field Spell, like "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]", "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]", or "[[Set Rotation]]" can severely hamper the deck's effectiveness, while cards that can temporarily negate the Field Spell, like "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]", can delay the deck's swarming for a turn.
  * "[[Token Collector]]" can prevent "Boss Stage" from producing Tokens, making activations of "Generaider" monsters' effects far more costly.
  * Because the archetype revoles around Level 9 Main Deck monsters, and "Boss Stage" only summons from Deck, the Deck has major issues with bricking and drawing garnets.
