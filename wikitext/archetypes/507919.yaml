  "'''Venom'''" (ヴェノム ''Venomu'') is an [[archetype]] consisting of two distinct categories of [[Monster Card|monsters]]; [[EARTH]] [[Reptile]]s (except "[[Venom Serpent]]") used by [[Thelonious Viper]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime and introduced in ''[[Tactical Evolution]]'', and [[DARK]] [[Dragon]]s used by [[Yuri]], [[Z-ARC]] and [[Yuya Sakaki]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime which are primarily of the "[[Starving Venom]]" sub-archetype (except "[[Odd-Eyes Venom Dragon]]").

  ==Playing style==
  The Reptile monsters focus on the distribution of [[Venom Counter]]s via "[[Venom Swamp]]", while their strongest monsters (which are not technically a part of the archetype, but related to it) gain [[ATK]] for each [[Reptile]] [[monster]] in the [[Graveyard]]. "[[Vennominaga the Deity of Poisonous Snakes]]" gives an alternate win condition via its [[Hyper-Venom Counter]]s.

  The Deck focuses on lowering the opponent's monsters' [[ATK]] with "Venom Swamp" and Summoning "[[Vennominon the King of Poisonous Snakes]]" or "Vennominaga". Since the ATK of both cards are dependent on the number of Reptiles in your Graveyard, cards like "[[Foolish Burial]]" and "[[Snake Rain]]" are important in this Deck. Also, there are not many "Venom" monsters, so a hybrid with other Decks is inevitable.

  "Venom Swamp" is able to quickly weaken and eventually [[destroy]] any non-"Venom" monster. Also, even if "Venom Swamp" is not on the field, "[[Venom Burn]]" can inflict serious [[effect damage|damage]] to a player's [[Life Points]]"

  ===Weaknesses===
  * The Deck relies on "Venom Swamp" for Venom Counters to have any effect on monsters, so if "Venom Swamp" is destroyed, Venom Counters are almost useless. This bad situation can be avoided by "[[Spell Reclamation]]".

  * Summoning "Vennominaga" is difficult since you need to Summon it with "[[Rise of the Snake Deity]]", meaning that "[[Seven Tools of the Bandit]]" or "[[Wiretap]]" can halt the Summon.

  * The main weakness of the "Venom" Deck is the low ATK points of most "Venom" monsters. This means that your opponent can easily just Summon a monster to destroy your "Venom" monster.

  * Another weakness of this Deck is "[[Zombie World]]". This card makes the ATK of "Vennominaga" become 0, and when it is destroyed by battle there are no Reptile monsters in the Graveyard to banish in order to Special Summon it again.

  * The Deck relies on "Venom Swamp", so "[[Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell]]" will shut this Deck down.

  * Since the Deck relies on Reptile monsters being sent to the Graveyard, it is at its most vulnerable when [[banish]] strategies are used, like "[[Dimensional Fissure]]".

  * "Venom" Decks are at risk of losing [[LP]] early, since the only reliable methods for quickly Summoning "Vennominon" from the Deck involve taking damage (either via "[[Damage = Reptile]]" or "[[Damage Condenser]]").
