  ==Playing style==
  The "Paleozoic" archetype is mainly composed of Normal Trap Cards. Each one have its particular effect but they have in common the capacity of Special Summoning themselves from the Graveyard as a Level 2 WATER Aqua Normal Monster with 1200 ATK and 0 DEF whenever a Trap Card is activated, thus allowing them to quickly swarm the field through normal usage of their own Trap Effects. The archetype's ace cards are their Xyz monsters, namely "[[Paleozoic Anomalocaris]]" and "[[Paleozoic Opabinia]]".

  "Anomalocaris" helps to maintain hand advantage by excavating the Deck and adding an excavated Trap Card to the hand (be it a "Paleozoic" Card or not); this effect triggers when a Trap Card is sent from the Spell/Trap Zone to the Graveyard. "Opabinia" speeds up the Deck's strategy, by allowing "Paleozoic" cards from being activated directly from the hand. Both of them are unaffected by other monster's effects and have an additional effect that basically rewards their owner for using them in a dedicated "Paleozoic" Deck, by either destroying a troublesome card on the field or fetching a "Paleozoic" Card from the Deck.

  The archetype's Trap Cards banish themselves when they leaves the field after being Summoned from the Graveyard by their own effects, which can be avoided by using them as Xyz Materials. Thus, the archetype also benefits from utilizing other Rank 2 Xyz Monsters such as "[[Armored Kappa]]" and "[[Sky Cavalry Centaurea]]" in concert with "Anomalocaris" and "Opabinia". As the archetype's Trap Cards are all Level 2 WATER Aqua monsters while they are treated as monsters, "[[Wetlands]]" can be included in the Deck to give these cards a much needed power boost, as they all have low ATK, which can raise issues regarding their ability to survive on the field.

  The Deck itself also has amazing synergy with the Frog engine, mainly "[[Swap Frog]]", "[[Dupe Frog]]" and "[[Ronintoadin]]" since they are also Level 2 Aqua monsters. Due to this, and the fact that the Paleozoic cards themselves are treated as Aqua monsters while on the field, they can play the Rank 2 Xyz "[[Toadally Awesome]]".

  Due to their capability of accumulating chain, you can also consider adding some cards like  "[[Accumulated Fortune]]" and  "[[Miraculous Rebirth]]". While somewhat slow, "[[Mask of Darkness ]]" can still be used to recycle some Paleozoic cards and in a bigger extent, also be used as a Xyz Material."[[Magical Hats]]" will search 2 Paleozoic cards from your Deck while letting you Summon another from your GY. "[[Justi-Break]]" will protect your Paleozoic cards and potentially clean the field while letting you summon another Paleozoic card from your GY.

  ===Weaknesses===
  This archetype is mainly dependent on activating Set Trap Cards to trigger their "Paleozoic" Traps' effects to Special Summon themselves from the Graveyard. "[[Legacy of the Duelist]]" can force the opponent to only Set 1 Trap Card per turn, while "[[Denko Sekka]]" and "[[Jinzo]]" can completely prevent Set Trap Cards from being activated (with the effect of "[[Paleozoic Opabinia]]" only circumventing "Denko Sekka"). The effects of cards such as "[[Necrovalley]]", "[[Royal Prison]]", and "[[The End of Anubis]]" can prevent the "Paleozoic" Duelist from Special Summoning any "Paleozoic" Trap from the Graveyard, while the banishing effects of cards like "[[Antihuman Intelligence ME-PSY-YA]]", "[[Banisher of the Radiance]]", and "[[Macro Cosmos]]" can prevent the "Paleozoic" Duelist from loading up their Graveyard with "Paleozoic" Traps. However, these cards can still be dealt with by the effects of "[[Paleozoic Olenoides]]" and "[[Paleozoic Dinomischus]]", among other generic options, while the banishing card effects can be specifically countered via "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]", which also addresses the archetype's self-banishing weakness.

  Most importantly, almost any Deck has the potential to disrupt this archetype's strategy, simply by Chaining a Spell or monster effect to the activation of any of the "Paleozoic" Duelist's Trap Cards. By doing do, this will prevent the "Paleozoic" Duelist from activating the effect of any of their "Paleozoic" Traps in the Graveyard at the time, and that player will need to activate another Trap Card in order to gain the opportunity to Special Summon again.

  Due to their Traps' self-banishing effects, this archetype is best suited for Xyz Summoning, in order to avoid the banishing downside and use the Traps' Graveyard effects again. While this self-inflicted weakness can be addressed by using "Imperial Iron Wall" (preventing all banishing), and "[[Paleozoic Leanchoilia]]" to a lesser extent (returning 1 banished card to the Graveyard), an opponent can specifically target the Xyz Summoning aspect with "[[And the Band Played On]]".
