  "'''Branded'''" ({{Ruby|烙|らく}}{{Ruby|印|いん}} ''Rakuin'') is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Lightning Overdrive]]''.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX card storylines#No. 01: The Closed Land|The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines#No. 01: The Land of the Abyss}}

  ==Design==
  Similar to "[[World Legacy]]" throughout [[Series 10]], the "Branded" cards serve as a connecting narrative thread between many of the themes introduced throughout [[Series 11]] that are part of the [[The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines|Abyss storyline]] (such as "[[Dogmatika]]" and "[[Despia]]"), and detail major plot developments through their artworks.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Branded" is an archetype of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s (as well as one [[Fusion Monster]], "[[Albion the Branded Dragon]]") that support the [[Fusion Summon]]-based playstyles of "[[Fallen of Albaz]]" (and its related cards), the [[Ritual Summon]]-centric portion of the "[[Dogmatika]]" archetype, as well as generally supporting the "[[Despia]]" and "[[Bystial]]" archetypes.

  Alongside "Despia", the archetypes form an overarching playstyle typically called "Branded Despia"; within Branded Despia, "Branded" cards serve as the Deck's main playmakers, and accessing "Branded" cards via "Despia" monsters and "Albaz" Fusion Monsters composes the Deck's primary resource loop.

  Alongside "Fallen of Albaz" and the "Dogmatika" and "Bystial" archetypes, the archetype generally serve as support to propel those archetypes' respective play styles by boosting speed, increasing advantage, and/or providing protection and disruption capabilities.

  As an additional note, each of the "Branded" Spells & Traps that debuted in ''[[Lightning Overdrive]]'' have a shared [[only once per turn]] effect that Sets themselves to the [[field]] at the [[End Phase]] if discarded to activate the effect of "Fallen of Albaz".
