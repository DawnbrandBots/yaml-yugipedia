  "'''Mekk-Knight'''", known as "'''Jack-Knights'''" (ジャックナイツ ''Jakkunaitsu'') in the [[OCG]], is an archetype largely comprised of [[LIGHT]] [[Psychic]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] debuting in ''[[Extreme Force]]''.
  The archetype is both related to, and is supported by, the "[[World Legacy]]" archetype, and is a part of the 'World Legacy' storyline.
  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Master Guide 6 card storylines#File No. 01: The Endlessly Repeating Tale of the Rise and Fall of a Certain World}}
  ==Etymology==
  The kanji ''kikai-kishi'' (機界騎士, lit. "Machine World Knight") is applied to the "Jack-Knights" (ジャックナイツ ''Jakkunaitsu'') reading in the Japanese names of the main "Mekk-Knight" monsters.

  Unlike the other members, "[[Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star]]" uses the kanji ''kikai-kishi'' (機械騎士, lit. "Machinery Knight") instead. ''Kikai'' (機械 "machinery") is a homophone of ''kikai'' (機界, "machine world"), substituting the kanji ''kai'' (界, "world") with ''kai'' (械, "contraption").

  The archetype's [[OCG]] name "Jack-Knights" is named after [[wikipedia:Phone connector (audio)|jack plugs]], a type of electrical connector typically used for analog audio signals. Fittingly, several of the "Mekk-Knights" possess jack plugs for arms, implying that they plug their arms into their weapons. The act of plugging may also be a reference to the archetype's [[Link Summon]] playstyle.

  The audio aspect of jack plugs is thematic with the musical themes of the related "[[Knightmare]]" and "[[Orcust]]" archetypes. Jack plugs can also be seen as analogous of keys, which relates to the original role of the "Mekk-Knights" as machines that harness the power of the 'Key'.

  The [[TCG]] names of the "Mekk-Knight" monsters reference various celestial phenomena.
  ==Design==
  The main seven [[Main Deck]] "Mekk-Knight" monsters take the form of robotic humanoid beings. Each "Mekk-Knight" possesses star-shaped cores, along with glowing energy lines on their bodies, color-coded with the colors of the [[wikipedia:Visible spectrum|visible spectrum]].

  In the 'World Legacy' storyline, the cores of the "Mekk-Knights" were extracted by "[[Knightmare Corruptor Iblee]]" to create the "[[Knightmare]]" monsters, with the exception of "[[Mekk-Knight Blue Sky]]". "Blue Sky" passed down its power onto "[[Auram the World Chalice Blademaster]]" instead.

  The main "Mekk-Knight" [[Link Monster]]s possess special statuses among the "Mekk-Knights". "[[Mekk-Knight Spectrum Supreme]]" is the combination of all 7 "Mekk-Knights", and it is represented by the visible spectrum of colors. "[[Mekk-Knight of the Morning Star]]" was the original "Mekk-Knight", while the other 7 "Mekk-Knights" were created as secondary support machines.

  Several "Mekk-Knight" monsters are upgraded counterparts to the protagonists in the 'World Legacy' storyline. Their archetypal names also connect them to their own secondary archetypes. Notably, "[[Mekk-Knight Avram]]" and "[[Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax]]" are color-coded with the color blue. This represents the power that "Auram" inherited from "Blue Sky", as depicted in "[[World Legacy Succession]]" and "[[Crusadia Testament]]".

  ==Playing style==
  The "Mekk-Knight" archetype's playstyle focuses on Special Summoning high Level monsters while there are two or more cards in the same column, in order to [[swarm]] the [[field]] and generate [[hand advantage]]. In addition to depending on column setups for the [[Summon]]ing effect of the Main Deck monsters, most of the [[Effect Monster]]s and much of their [[Spell]]/[[Trap]] support are based on being in the same column as an opponent's card (or the opposite, with "Morning Star" and "Spectrum Supreme"). The archetype is played in a control-beatdown playstyle, focusing on strategic disruptions, resource accumulation, and high-ATK monsters to close the game quickly over a few turns.

  The seven key Main Deck "Mekk-Knight" [[Effect Monster]]s share the following effect:
  {{Quote|''"If 2 or more cards are in the same column, you can [[Special Summon]] this card (from your hand) in that column. You can only Special Summon "..." once per turn this way."''}}
  If the opponent controls a card (such as when going second), this condition can be easily fulfilled by [[set]]ting a [[Spell]]/[[Trap]] in the same column as an opposing card. However, against an empty board (such as when going first), fulfilling this condition becomes more difficult, but still possible. Methods include:

  * Perform a low-cost Extra Deck Summon (e.g. with "[[Instant Fusion]]", or by normal summoning a monster and linking it for "[[Salamangreat Almiraj]]") to summon a monster in an Extra Monster Zone, and set a Spell/Trap in its column.
  * Special Summon a monster to the opponent's field (e.g. with "[[Knightmare Corruptor Iblee]]" or "[[Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight]]"), and set a Spell/Trap in its column.
  On the field, each of the seven "Mekk-Knight" monsters have different effects. Some are more situational: "[[Mekk-Knight Red Moon|Red Moon]]" and "[[Mekk-Knight Yellow Star|Yellow Star]]" have situational card destruction effects, while "[[Mekk-Knight Orange Sunset|Orange Sunset]]" and "[[Mekk-Knight Green Horizon|Green Horizon]]" have situational swarming and recovery effects. The key "Mekk-Knight" monsters are "[[Mekk-Knight Purple Nightfall|Purple Nightfall]]", "[[Mekk-Knight Blue Sky|Blue Sky]]", and "[[Mekk-Knight Indigo Eclipse|Indigo Eclipse]]".
  * "Purple Nightfall" is a "Mekk-Knight" [[search]]er; it temporarily [[banish]]es a "Mekk-Knight" monster (typically itself) as a [[Quick Effect]] to search out another one.
  * "Blue Sky" is also a "Mekk-Knight" searcher; it searches upon being Summoned from the hand, the number searched out being equal to the number of opposing cards in its column (i.e. a maximum of 3 at once).
  * "Indigo Eclipse" has a Quick Effect to move a "Mekk-Knight" to another column; it can be used to make space to Special Summon more "Mekk-Knight" monsters, and, if either "[[World Legacy Key]]", "[[World Legacy's Secret|Secret]]" or "[[World Legacy Whispers|Whispers]]" is active, can disrupt the opponent's plays by moving a "Mekk-Knight" to the same column as opposing cards.
  In terms of supportive Spell/Traps, the archetype's specific support Spell/Traps are all "[[World Legacy]]" cards, tying the archetype to the greater "World Legacy" series and their own support (e.g. "[[Lib the World Key Blademaster]]").
  * "[[World Legacy's Memory]]" is a powerful consistency tool that can Special Summon any "Mekk-Knight" monster from the hand or Deck in either player's turn, but will return the summoned monster to the hand in the [[End Phase]], and locks the player into only summoning "Mekk-Knight" monsters for the turn; "Memory" is typically used to summon "Purple Nightfall" on the opponent's turn, who would then banish itself for a search, alleviating the negative effects of "Memory".
  * "[[World Legacy Scars]]" is the Deck's [[Field Spell]], providing situational stat buffs and card cycling, and a costly but ''devastating'' effect to completely empty the opponent's hand ''and'' [[Extra Deck]], by banishing 8 different "Mekk-Knight" monsters from the face-up field or GY. It is usually only played in dedicated decks focusing on activating its second effect as quickly as possible.
  * "[[World Legacy Key]]", "[[World Legacy's Secret|Secret]]" and "[[World Legacy Whispers|Whispers]]" are [[Continuous Spell]]/[[Continuous Trap|Traps]] that serve as the archetype's primary disruption tools. While on the field, each of them continuously negates a specific type of card's effect that the opponent resolves in the same column as a friendly "Mekk-Knight" monster: "Key" negates Traps, "Secret" negates monsters, and "Whispers" negates Spells. As mentioned, "Indigo Eclipse" can move "Mekk-Knight" monsters as a Quick Effect, allowing it to reactively negate opposing cards alongside these three cards. If the player occupies all five columns with "Mekk-Knight" monsters, then the opponent will be effectively shut out of using a specific type of card.

  "[[Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight]]" is a unique "Mekk-Knight" monster that can be [[Normal Summon]]ed without [[Tribute]]s, can send a "World Legacy" card to the [[GY]], and can Special Summon a [[Token]] to the opponent's side of the field, which helps facilitate the conditions for "Mekk-Knight" Special Summons.
  <!--Link monster overview here-->

  Naturally, as they are related, splashing in other "World Legacy" cards could provide an extra boost to the Deck; "[[World Legacy - "World Armor"]]" can help out by searching Spells and Traps, as well as provide [[material]] for additional Summons when combined with "[[Lib the World Key Blademaster]]" after being [[mill]]ed by "Girsu", as "Lib" can then revive it with "[[World Legacy Succession]]". "[[Knightmare Corruptor Iblee]]" is also a good choice as it can bring back any of your used Link Monsters for more mileage as well as help set-up the Special Summon effects of most "Mekk-Knight" monsters. It can also be used as material for "[[Linguriboh]]". Due to the archetype being comprised largely of Psychic monsters, "[[PSY-Framelord Lambda]]" may also help as it can allow for more disruption as well as search a strong card like "[[PSY-Framegear Gamma]]" due to a monster like "Purple Nightfall". "[[Galatea, the Orcust Automaton]]" can help recycle banished copies of "Girsu", "Morning Star", and ""World Armor"", on top of allowing one to use "[[Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star]]" as a solid form of protection.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Cards that prevents the player from Special Summoning can hurt the Deck's capability to swarm. Examples include the [[Vanity's]] series, "[[Archlord Kristya]]", "[[Evilswarm Ophion]]", etc.
  * Minimizing the amount of cards placed on the field can reduce the number of active columns that a "Mekk-Knight" can be Summoned to.
  * Floodgates such as "[[Lose 1 Turn]]" make the "Mekk-Knight" archetype more vulnerable to destruction.
