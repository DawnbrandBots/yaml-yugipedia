  "'''Mannadium'''" (マナドゥム ''Manadumu'') is an [[archetype]] of primarily [[Fairy]] monsters introduced in ''[[Cyberstorm Access]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 02: The New Broken Worlds}}

  ==Design==
  It seems that the world of "[[Peaceful Planet Calarium]]" represents, or even exists within, "[[Visas Starfrost]]'s" mind, with the Level 2s being his memories of the other worlds and "Riumheart" being "Visas's" super ego.

  "[[Mannadium Meek]]", "[[Mannadium Fearless]]", and "[[Mannadium Torrid]]" depict orbs on a tree featuring counterparts to the "[[Broken World]]s" of the "[[Scareclaw]]", "[[Tearlaments]]", and "[[Kashtira]]" archetypes. The masked chibi character in each orb corresponds to the "[[Heart]]" figure in each of those worlds.

  "[[Mannadium Riumheart]]" is an observer to these events, having a gentle and saintly appearance, a stark contrast to the "[[Heart]]" figures in the other "[[Broken World]]s".

  ==Playing style==
  "Mannadium" is a [[Synchro Summon|Synchro]] archetype focused on destroying their own monsters through various effects, such as the effect of "[[Visas Starfrost]]", to generate more resources for Synchro Summons. Both [[Level]] 2 [[Tuner monster]]s, "[[Mannadium Fearless]] and "[[Mannadium Meek]]", share the same general effects to [[Special Summon]] themselves from the [[Hand|hand]] if you control either "Visas Starfrost" or a monster with 1500 ATK/2100 DEF on the field and the ability to Special Summon another copy of themselves from the Deck when destroyed by battle or card effect with an additional effect; either increasing the ATK of Synchro Monsters for the Battle Phase for "Fearless" or increasing the Level of the next monsters Summoned by 2 for "Meek". This is further enhanced through their [[Field Spell Card]], "[[Peaceful Planet Calarium]]" and its ability to resummon a Tuner monster from the GY that was destroyed by battle or card effect once per turn.

  The primary boss of the theme is "[[Mannadium Prime-Heart]]", A Level 10 [[Synchro Monster]] that is unique in that it is the first Synchro Monster since "[[XX-Saber Gottoms]]" that is able to be Synchro Summoned using solely Tuner Monsters. "Prime-Heart" is able to attack multiple times in the [[Battle Phase]] up to how many Tuner Monsters were used to Synchro Summon it with targeting protection and the ability to Special Summon "Visas Starfrost" or a monster with 1500 ATK/2100 DEF that is banished or in the GY when it leaves the field by an opponent's card.
  Generally speaking, "Mannadium" is flexible in that it can be used in tandem with the primary lore themes of the [[Broken World]] series due to various cards supporting "Visas Starfrost" alongside their own archetypes. The best contender for this is "[[Scareclaw]]" however as the theme allows for added consistency to go into strong Synchro and Link plays with the many resources produced by spawning Tuner monsters to the field.
