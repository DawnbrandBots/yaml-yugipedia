  "'''Gusto'''", known as "'''Gusta'''" (ガスタ ''Gasuta'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', are a [[WIND]]-based [[Duel Terminal]] [[archetype]] released in ''[[Duel Terminal - Raid of the Inverz!!]]''. Their name is based on the word "Gust" and their team symbol is a circle with a silver whirlwind inside it. Their [[Synchro Monster]]s seems to be the combined form of the two monsters that appear in the artworks (evidenced by their Level sum).
  The archetype consists of [[Winged Beast]], [[Psychic]], [[Thunder]], even [[Daigusto Emeral|Rock]] and [[Daigusto Phoenix|Pyro]] monsters. The Winged Beast-Type contains most of the "Gusto" Tuner monsters (except "[[Gusto Codor]]" and "[[Gusto Griffin]]"), but there are exceptions ("[[Gusto Squirro]]" being Thunder). All [[Synchro Monster]]s and [[Xyz Monster]]s of the archetype have "Daigusto" in their names.
  ==Duel Terminal Storyline==
  {{Main|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines|Master Guide 4 card storylines#The Little Protector in the Great Marshland|The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines#"Pilica" Enters the 'Star War' as a Member of the "Gusto" Tribe}}
  [[File:Crest-Gusto.svg|thumb|left|100px|The "Gusto" Crest.]]
  A tribe that lives with the wind and worships the bountiful land they’ve lived on since ancient times. Against their various outside enemies they link their hearts together with and battle along animals that live around in order to protect their land through the generations. However, the [[Steelswarm]]s started to take over the surface land. So, the Gustos united with the other clans to create a temporary union lead by [[Vylon]]s. They obtained [[Daigusto Sphreez|new powers]] to fight back the Steelswarms. Soon, the union finally defeated the invaders, but conflicts haven't lowered yet; the Vylons decided to stop the wars between clans — by exterminating them completely. Later, the Gusto [[Daigusto Phoenix|teamed up once again]] [[Evigishki Merrowgeist|with the other clans]] in order to cease the Vylon's actions.
  After stopping the Vylons, the union between the tribes disbanded. At the time, Gusto tribes were in danger of being attacked by the [[Gishki]]s (with goals to claim all the [[Mist Valley]]'s resources by themselves for their rituals). Fortunately, the [[Gem-Knight]]s foresaw this, and they [[Daigusto Emeral|lend their powers]] to protect Gusto tribes from danger. After the [[lswarm]]s appeared and threatened to destroy the world, the Gusto decided to join forces with Gem-Knights and [[Constellar]]s to stop lswarms for good.
  After the war against lswarms and [[Sophia, Goddess of Rebirth|Sophia]] has ended, it is known that the only survivor of this tribe from the war are [[Kamui, Hope of Gusto|Kamui]] and [[Reeze, Whirlwind of Gusto|Reeze]]. Shortly after, those two formed a family, and [[Pilica, Descendant of Gusto|Pilica]] was born. It is unknown what happened to Reeze at this point, but [[Ritual Beast Tamer Elder|Kamui]], along with Pilica eventually created [[Ritual Beast|a new tribe]], while [[Synchro Summon|inheriting]] their [[Contact Fusion|ability]] of [[Ritual Beast Ulti|communicating with nature]] into [[Ritual Beast Tamer Lara|their]] [[Ritual Beast Tamer Wen|successors]], giving birth to a new [[Ritual Beast Tamer|generation]].
  Below are the connections that Gustos have, either within their own tribe or with outsiders:

  ==Playing style==
  The archetype's main strategy is almost entirely based on tightening their defense and loading the Graveyard, since most support for the Gusto archetype requires shuffling at least 2 or more Gusto monsters into the Deck. The Deck relies on heavy defensive tactics, beginning with its trio of searchers which form what Duelists refer to as "the recruiter loop": "[[Winda, Priestess of Gusto]]", "[[Gusto Gulldo]]" and "[[Gusto Egul]]." These three cards can continuously search one another out of the Deck when destroyed in battle while simultaneously filling the Graveyard with monsters, which can be utilized later with effects such as "[[Caam, Serenity of Gusto]]", "[[Pilica, Descendant of Gusto]]", and their Synchro Monsters as well.
  With the release of "Pilica, Descendant of Gusto", the deck's now slightly have more focus at getting necessary Tuners in the Graveyard, but still retain the basic defense of the recruiter loop. Pilica becomes staple in this deck (along with "[[Emergency Teleport]]"), since she not only enables this deck to Summon Sphreez faster without relying on interaction with your opponent, she also lets you swarm the Field faster when combined with "[[Call of the Haunted]]", "[[Oasis of Dragon Souls]]" and/or "[[Powerful Rebirth]]".

  ===Weaknesses===
  As previously touched upon, "Gusto" decks’ critical flaws are the below-average ATK of many of its monsters, making them somewhat unsuitable for offensive purpose. Since this Deck's strategy relies heavily on the Graveyard, any form of banishments can damage or cripple the entire Deck. "[[Transmigration Break]]" can effectively incapacitate this Deck due to their necessity of recycling monsters. "[[Gravekeeper]]" deck's "[[Necrovalley]]," can shut down this deck's almost any major play, while only "[[Caam, Serenity of Gusto]]" and "[[Daigusto Gulldos]]" that can bypass Necrovalley's limitation. "[[Archlord Kristya]]", "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Summon Limit]]", "[[Poisonous Winds]]" and other anti-Special Summon cards can also shut down "Gusto" defenses down, due to their excessive reliance on Special and Synchro Summoning.
  Decks that excel at mass destruction/disruption effects such as "[[Inzektor]]", "[[Lightsworn]]", "[[Fire King]]" or "[[Burning Abyss]]" can severely cripple this deck by simply bypassing their Special Summon tricks with destruction/non-battle removal effects instead. Since most of this deck's major plays involve Extra Deck monsters, decks like "[[Shaddoll]]" and "[[Nekroz]]" can punish the deck harshly (the most dangerous one coming from "[[El Shaddoll Winda]]" or "[[Nekroz of Unicore]]"). In the cases of the latter, "[[Nekroz of Trishula]]" is probably the most dangerous among the Nekroz arsenal for this deck to face because of its simultaneous banishing effect.
  "[[Abyss Dweller]]" and "[[Soul Drain]]" also pose a threat by disabling any in-Graveyard effects; including most of the searchers, while "[[Armades, Keeper of Boundaries]]", "[[Archfiend Black Skull Dragon]]", and "[[U.A. Mighty Slugger]]" prevent most of the battle searcher's effects from activating at all just by attacking them.
  Despite the numerous weaknesses of the deck, there are ways you can get around these threats. Spell/Trap removal cards like "[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]", "[[Dust Tornado]]", "[[Fairy Wind]]", "[[Trap Stun]]", or "[[Royal Decree]]" (in some variants like Synchron Gusto) etc can be used to negate or destroy "floodgate" threats like "[[Macro Cosmos]]", "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]", "[[Poisonous Winds]]", "[[Necrovalley]]". Monster effect negation cards like "[[Breakthrough Skill]]", "[[Fiendish Chain]]", "[[Effect Veiler]]", "[[Divine Wrath]]", "[[Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare]]", and "[[Skill Prisoner]]" can stop dangerous monster effects. Against Special Summoned monsters with high-impact effects, you can use cards that negate their Summon, such as "[[Solemn Warning]]", "[[Black Horn of Heaven]]", "Stardust Warrior", etc.
  == Trivia ==
  * "Gusto" [[Synchro Monster]]s are similar to "[[Dragunity]]" Synchro Monsters in terms of appearance, consisting of riders and their mounts ([[Winged Beast]] and [[Dragon]]s for "Dragunity" and [[Psychic]] and [[Winged Beast]]s for "Gusto", respectively).
  ** "[[Daigusto Sphreez]]" is the only exception, since she does not have a mount.
  ** This is probably referencing to the partnership between "[[Mist Valley]]" and "Dragunity" during the first generation wars of Duel Terminal world.
  * All "Gusto" non-Synchro Psychic-Type monster seems to have a pairing system between its male and female members, which determined by their [[Level]]s ("Pilica" is the only exception, due to the reason explained below.). If sorted from the highest to the lowest, it may resemble a family tree of some sort. According to that, one can be assume that "[[Windaar, Sage of Gusto]]" is their leader.
  ** "[[Pilica, Descendant of Gusto]]" is the only member that (currently) have no male counterpart.
  ** Because she's the last one being born within the Gusto family ("Kamui" being her father), she's technically the youngest among them.
  ** According to the Master Guide 4<ref>[http://www.ygorganization.com/monsterstories/ www.ygorganization.com] Master Guide 4 - Monster Stories</ref>, "Pilica" was born after the conclusion of the war against "[[Sophia, Goddess of Rebirth]]", in which "Sophia" was defeated by "[[Evilswarm Kerykeion]]" and "[[Constellar Sombre]]". It is also said that "Pilica" is the descendant from "[[Reeze, Whirlwind of Gusto]]" and "[[Kamui, Hope of Gusto]]", implying that those two are the only ones surviving from the Gusto tribe after the war's conclusion.
  ** The staff that "Pilica" is holding is the very same as the ones owned by "Kamui", with the wooden statue of "[[Gusto Falco]]" on top (possibly as a memento of its sacrifice during the war).
  * The [[Ritual Beast]] archetype is originated from Gusto archetype. 
  ** This is evidenced by their leader, "[[Ritual Beast Tamer Elder]]" is actually an elderly version of "[[Kamui, Hope of Gusto]]". 
  ** Their [[Ritual Beast Ulti|Fusion Monster]]s also have the "[[Ritual Beast Tamer|rider]] and [[Spiritual Beast|mount]]" relationship in the same manner as the "Gusto" Synchro Monsters. 
  ** The [[Ritual Beast Tamer]]s are also [[WIND]] [[Psychic]]-type as well.
  ** Later on, "Pilica" also joins the [[Ritual Beast Tamer]]s after [[Ritual Beast Tamer Zeframpilica|receiving the power of]] [[Zefra]], with "[[Spiritual Beast Rampengu]]" as her mount. She also appears in the artwork of "[[Ritual Beast Ambush]]" and "[[Zefra Path]]".
  ** Following the destruction of "[[Tierra, Source of Destruction]]", "Winda" (after being [[Ritual Beast Return|liberated]] from the "Shaddoll" curse) also joins the Ritual Beasts as "[[Spiritual Beast Tamer Winda]]".
  * If you look closely to "Gusto" Psychic-type monsters' eyes (best examples are "[[Winda, Priestess of Gusto]]" and "[[Reeze, Whirlwind of Gusto]]"), you can see that they have cross-like marking in their pupils (slightly resembling Uchiha Itachi's ''Mangekyou Sharingan'' from ''Naruto'' anime/manga series). However, some of Gusto monsters like "[[Kamui, Hope of Gusto]]" doesn't share this characteristic and it is currently unknown if the other Gusto members actually share this characteristic as well.
  ** All "Gusto" Synchro Monsters and Gusto's non-Psychic-type, non-Xyz monsters share this characteristic.
  ** Despite being Winda's sister, "[[Wynn the Wind Charmer]]" lacks the Gusto eye crests.  This lends credence to the theory that not all Gusto actually share this characteristic.
  * This archetype has many similarities to the "[[Yang Zing]]" archetype.
  ** They thave their own set of "recruiter loop" monsters.
  ** Both are Synchro Summon-oriented.
  ** They have members, which become corrupted into "[[Shaddoll]]" monsters; "[[Gusto Falco]]" becomes "[[Shaddoll Falco]]", "[[Suanni, Fire of the Yang Zing]]" becomes "[[Shaddoll Dragon]]" and [[Winda, Priestess of Gusto]]" and "[[Pulao, Wind of the Yang Zing]] together become "[[El Shaddoll Winda]]".
