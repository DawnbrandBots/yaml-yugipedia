  "'''Hole'''" (ホール ''Hōru'') is an [[archetype]] of cards supported by the "[[Traptrix]]" archetype.
  Although they are related to the "[[Trap Hole (archetype)|Trap Hole]]" archetype through the "Traptrix", they are a separate group of cards. Since all support for the "Hole" archetype also supports the "Trap Hole" archetype, in the ''[[TCG]]'', the "Trap Hole" archetype is treated as a sub-archetype of the "Hole" archetype.
  All "Trap Hole" cards are not considered to be part of this archetype, as their Japanese names do not contain 「ホール」; however, "[[Chaos Trap Hole]]", "[[Gemini Trap Hole]]" are "Hole" cards but not "Trap Hole" cards, since their Japanese names contain 「落とし穴」but with the furigana for "Hole" (ホール ''Hōru'') instead of "Pitfall" ({{Ruby|落|お}}とし{{Ruby|穴|あな}} ''Otoshiana'').
  Due to their Japanese names, a number of unrelated cards, such as "[[Stronghold the Moving Fortress]]" and "[[Holding Arms]]", also fall into this archetype. Also, "[[Goblin Pothole Squad]]" includes "Hole" in its name but is not part of this archetype. However, because ''TCG'' and ''OCG'' support for this archetype only works on [[Normal Trap Card]]s, neither are an issue.
