  "'''Earthbound'''" ({{Ruby|地|じ}}{{Ruby|縛|ばく}} ''Jibaku''), is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by the [[Dark Signers]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' and [[Sergey Volkov]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. The archetype consists of two sub-archetypes,  "[[Earthbound Immortal]]" and "[[Earthbound Servant]]".

  == Design ==
  The monsters are based on either the [[Nazca Lines]] (in the case of the "[[Earthbound Immortal]]s"), or simply other figures using the same design. Each monster has a black body with lines through their bodies of a predetermined color.
