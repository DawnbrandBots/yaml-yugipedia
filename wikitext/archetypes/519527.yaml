  "'''Code Talker'''" (コード・トーカー ''Kōdo Tōkā'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Cyberse]] [[Link Monster]]s used by [[Yusaku Fujiki]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]'' anime. Most members of this archetype are [[Link Rating|Link]]-3 monsters with 2300 [[ATK]].

  ==Design==
  The "Code Talkers" are cybernetic humanoids whose armor is colored based on their [[Attribute]]. Their bodies underneath the armor appear similar to the Ignis, particularly the darker bases of [[Ai]] and [[Flame]]. Each "Code Talker" wields a different weapon that can "expand" in some manner. Some of the members also share corresponding [[Attribute]]s and color-schemes with [[Main Deck]] monsters that support the archetype.

  ===Etymology===
  The archetype's name is taken from [[wikipedia:Code talker|code talkers]]. These individuals, who were typically Native Americans, were used by the United States during wars in the 20th Century as a means of encrypting and decrypting communications by using obscure languages that were not widespread and were difficult to translate.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Code Talker" archetype is an archetype of multi-Attribute Link Monsters that gain or provide buffs if they [[Points to|point to]] other monsters. As a Deck, the "Code Talker" Link Monsters are supported by the "Code" Main Deck monsters and "[[Cynet]]" Spell/Trap Cards, and the Deck has two general playstyles: combo or control.

  In a combo oriented "Code Talker" Deck, the Deck's goal is to use "[[Cynet Codec]]" to search out and swarm large amounts of Cyberse monsters, in order to build an impenetrable board of Extra Deck Link boss monsters, potentially even [[Extra Link]]ing the board.

  In a control oriented "Code Talker" Deck, the Deck's goal is to summon "[[Decode Talker Heatsoul]]" and draw multiple cards across the player and the opponent's turns, control the field using staple [[trap]]s and [[hand trap]]s, and eventually push for an OTK with "[[Accesscode Talker]]".

  ===Weakness===
  * A control "Code Talker" Deck exclusively relies on generic staple traps as disruption, meaning that the power of its end boards are dependent on the player's random draws, and can thus be inconsistent.
  * "Code Talker" combo Decks depend on "[[Cynet Codec]]" for its maximum ceiling boards, and removing access to "Codec" can significantly reduce the Deck's power ceiling.
  * "Code Talker" combos are extremely predictable, and are weak to floodgates and blowout.

  ==Trivia==
  * This is the first [[archetype]]/[[series]] composed entirely of [[Cyberse]] monsters, as well as the first one made purely of [[Link Monster]]s.

  * The [[Attack and effect names|attack names]] of all "Code Talkers" in the Japanese version contain a conclusive word in addition to the "code" portion of their names, with the exception of "Powercode Talker" and "Shootingcode Talker" who simply have the portion before the "code" part of their names.
  ** "Decode Talker" - Decode End
  ** "Encode Talker" - Final Encode
  ** "Excode Talker" - Excode Close
  ** "Powercode Talker" - Power Termination Smash
  ** "Shootingcode Talker" - Shooting Complete
  ** "Transcode Talker" - Transcode Finish
