  "'''Centurion'''" (センチュリオン ''Senchurion'') is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Valiant Smashers]]''.

  ==Etymology==
  The name of the theme likely derives from those of real-life Roman centurions, or commanders of a group of 100 men known as a "century". Each monster has the "Centurion" katakana applied over its individual kanji name, which denotes its "rank" within the theme.

  ==Design==

  The archetype's design seems to be inspired from various examples of mecha in media, such as anime produced by [[wikipedia:Gainax|Gainax]] and its successor [[wikipedia:Studio Trigger|Studio Trigger]]. In particular ''[[wikipedia:Gunbuster|Gunbuster]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann|Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann]]'', and ''[[wikipedia:Darling in the Franxx|Darling in the Franxx]]''. It also seems to reference SD Mecha series, particularly Haō Taikei Ryū Knight, as well as the [[wikipedia:Sakura Wars|Sakura Wars]] series of games.

  ==Playing style==
  "Centurion" is a [[Synchro]] theme focused on placing monsters in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] as [[Continuous Trap Card]]s and quickly [[Synchro Summon]]ing various [[Level]] 8 and 12 [[Synchro Monster]]s, including their Level 12 Synchro Monster, "[[Centurion Legatia]]".

  All [[Main Deck]] monsters can [[Special Summon]] themselves while in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]]. Since their effects treat them as Continuous Traps, they can also Summon themselves during the opponent's turn. Combined with "[[Stand-Up Centurion!]]", the archetype's [[Field Spell]], they can perform Synchro Summons to interrupt the opponent's plays during their own turn.

  "Centurion Stand-Up!", "[[Centurion Primera]]", and "[[Centurion Trudea]]" function as the Deck's starters. "Stand-Up!" and "Trudea" can place a "Centurion" monster from the Deck in the Spell & Trap Zone, while "Primera" can search any "Centurion" card when it is Summoned. "Primera", by using its effect to Special Summon itself while it is a Continuous Trap, can repeatedly add "Centurion" cards to the hand, even during the opponent's turn.

  By placing "Centurion" monsters as Continuous Traps, the Deck can consistently generate materials to perform Synchro Summons. This is further aided by "[[Centurion Emet VI]]", a Level 8 monster that can Special Summon itself (during the opponent's turn) from the hand or GY by placing another "Centurion" monster the player controls in the Spell & Trap Zone. "Trudea" can also be used as material, since it can increase its Level to 8 when it is Special Summoned while treated as a Continuous Trap.

  The Deck's ability to consistently Summon "Primera", a Level 4 Tuner, and Level 8 monsters, results in an efficient gameplay loop of Synchro Summoning multiple Level 12 Synchro Monsters. Among them, the two most notable ones are the archetype's boss monster, "Centurion Legatia", and "[[Crimson Dragon (card)|Crimson Dragon]]". "Legatia" can produce advantage by drawing a card and (optionally) [[destroy]]ing the opponent's monsters with the highest [[ATK]] when it is Special Summoned, and can also place "Centurion" monsters from the hand or GY back in the Spell & Trap Zone, enabling more Synchro Summons. "Crimson Dragon" works as a bridge to even more powerful Level 12 [[Dragon]] Synchro Monsters, since it can Summon them while bypassing their material requirements, all while simply requiring the player to control another Level 12 Synchro Monster.

  "[[Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity]]" is a particularly powerful card to Summon with this archetype, as it can prevent the opponent from activating effects for the remainder of the turn when it is Synchro Summoned. Combined with "Stand-Up Centurion!", it can shut down the opponent's turn as early as during their Main Phase 1. In order to do this, the only requirements are "Stand-Up Centurion!" and a card in hand to [[send]] to the [[GY]] to use its effect. It can place "Centurion Primera" in the Spell & Trap Zone, from where it can Special Summon itself and add "Centurion Trudea" to the hand. "Trudea" can be Normal Summoned, and then place itself plus "Centurion Emet VI" from the Deck in the Spell & Trap Zone. "Emet VI" can Summon itself, and it can be used with "Primera" to Synchro Summon "Centurion Legatia", and during the End Phase, its effect can place "Primeira" from the GY into the Spell & Trap Zone. During the opponent's Main Phase 1, when the opponent performs any action, "Trudea" and "Primeira" can Special Summon themselves, and "Emet VI" can place "Trudea" back in the Spell & Trap Zone to Summon itself from the GY. This will trigger "Stand-Up Centurion!", allowing the Synchro Summon of "Crimson Dragon", which can use its effect by targeting "Legatia" to return itself to the [[Extra Deck]] and Special Summon "Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity", treating it as a Synchro Summon.

  The archetype also has multiple Spells/Traps that work as extenders or as removal, all of which can be consistently and repeatedly searched by "Primera". "[[Truth Centurion]]" can negate the activation of a card effect by sending a monster from the Spell & Trap Zone to the GY, which is easily achieved by other "Centurion" cards. "[[Faith of Centurion]]" can place any "Centurion" monster from the hand or GY in the Spell & Trap Zone, and it can do it once more with its GY effect when the player Summons a "Centurion" Synchro Monster. "[[Centurion Phalanx]]" can [[banish]] a [[Monster Card]] on the field, and Summon it back to its owner's field during the [[Standby Phase]] of the next turn, which can be used to disrupt the opponent's plays, or to Summon a "Centurion" Monster Card from the player's Spell & Trap Zone.
