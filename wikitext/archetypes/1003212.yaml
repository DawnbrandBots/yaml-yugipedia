  "'''Centurion'''" (センチュリオン ''Senchurion'') is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Valiant Smashers]]''.

  ==Design==
  The archetype's design seems to be inspired from various mecha anime produced by [[wikipedia:Gainax|Gainax]] and its successor [[wikipedia:Studio Trigger|Studio Trigger]]. In particular ''[[wikipedia:Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann|Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Darling in the Franxx|Darling in the Franxx]]''.
  ===Etymology===
  The name of the theme likely derives from those of real-life Roman centurions, or commanders of a group of 100 men known as a "century". Each "Centurion" monsters have the key katagana applied over their individual kanji names, which denote their "rank" within the theme.

  ==Playing style==
  "Centurion" is a [[Synchro]] theme focused on placing monsters in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] as [[Continuous Trap Card]]s and quickly [[Synchro Summon]]ing various [[Level]] 8 and 12 [[Synchro Monster]]s, including their Level 12 Synchro Monster, "[[Centurion Legatia]]".

  All [[Main Deck]] monsters can [[Special Summon]] themselves while in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]]. Since their effects treat them as Continuous Traps, they can also Summon themselves during the opponent's turn. Combined with "[[Stand-Up Centurion!]]", the archetype's [[Field Spell]], they can perform Synchro Summons to interrupt the opponent's plays during their own turn.
