  * Return 1 card from your hand to the Deck, and Set 1 "[[Black Illusion Ritual (Duel Links)|Black Illusion Ritual]]" or 1 "[[Polymerization (Duel Links)|Polymerization]]" to the field from the Deck. (Only 1 copy of cards with the same name can be Set during the Duel with this Skill.) Then, you can add 1 "[[Relinquished (Duel Links)|Relinquished]]" to your hand from the Deck.

  * Return 1 monster from your hand or the field to the Deck, and then play 1 "[[Bickuribox (Duel Links)|Bickuribox]]" from the Extra Deck.

  This Skill can only be used if you begin the Duel with a Deck (excluding Extra Deck) that contains no monsters other than a total of at least 10 Level 1 [[Spellcaster]]-Type monsters with "Relinquished" in their text.
