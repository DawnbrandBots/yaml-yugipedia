  == Playing style ==
  The "Codebreaker" archetype focuses on being detrimental to [[Link Monster]]s other than their own, primarily through stat reduction and potentially gaining more devastating effects depending on how many of them are present on the field. "Zero Day" is the main way they accomplish this, as any monster - bar a "Codebreaker" - loses 1000 [[ATK]] for each copy of it [[linked]] to that monster. Naturally, this can result in a large portion of a monster’s ATK disappearing and allowing it to be destroyed in battle much easier. But if a "Codebreaker" is destroyed while "Zero Day" is on the field, all copies of the latter are immediately destroyed as well; to mitigate this, the monster is able to [[add]] other copies from the [[Deck]] to the [[hand]]. Their first Link Monster, "Virus Swordsman" also helps with this as it’s able to [[Special Summon]] a "Zero Day" from almost anywhere, which can also possibly happen during either player’s turn as this activates whenever the monster is [[Summon]]ed though it must be [[co-linked]] at the time. It can also revive itself during the end of a turn itself was destroyed but will be [[banish]]ed if it [[leaves the field]]. Their second Link Monster, as well as their last monster entirely, is "Virus Berserker"; upon being Special Summoned "Berserker" can revive any pair of "Codebreaker" monsters to any [[zone]]s a Link Monster points to. It can also destroy [[Spell]]s/[[Trap]]s, up to the number of other members being linked.
  Due to being DARK Warrior monsters, cards like "[[Reinforcement of the Army]]" and "[[Allure of Darkness]]" can help immensely.

  == Weakness ==
  The main strategy of the "Codebreaker" archetype is the fact one is effectively giving the opponent fodder for their [[Extra Deck]], especially since the monsters lack any ability to lockout any monsters from there as well the monsters still being perfectly good [[Tribute]] fodder. This is especially bad due to powerful monsters generally requiring more [[material]]s for their Summons or effects such as "[[Monarch]]" monsters and particularly strong Link Monsters such as "[[Saryuja Skull Dread]]". "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" may also prove to particularly devastating.
