  "'''Magical Musket'''" ({{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|弾|だん}} ''Madan'', "'''Magibullet'''" in the ''[[OCG]]'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] debuting in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Spirit Warriors]]''.

  == Design ==
  As indicated by its Japanese name, "Magibullet", this archetype is inspired by the German [[wikipedia:Opera|opera]] ''[[wikipedia:Der Freischütz|Der Freischütz]]''. According to German folklore, the term "[[wikipedia:Freisch%C3%BCtz|Freischütz]]" refers to a marksman who made a contract with the devil to obtain seven magic bullets with supernatural accuracy. The first six bullets are subservient to the wielder's control, while the seventh will be in the devil's grip completely.
  All members of this archetype are based on legendary characters associated with guns. Visually, all of them share three design aspects: a demonic-styled weapon, a clawed blue arm holding the weapon, and one or more large, red wings with blue eyes near the joint.

  == Playing style ==
  This archetype revolves around using their monsters to accumulate their Spells/Traps in order to disrupt almost any moves their opponents may be attempting. All of their monsters can activate their effects when a Spell/Trap is activated in the same column as theirs (including opponent's). In addition, they also allow their user to activate "Magical Musket" Spell/Traps from their hand during either player's turn, essentially turning them into [[Hand trap|hand traps]], making their moves harder to predict and protect against.

  Their monsters all have different effects, ranging from searching ("[[Magical Musketeer Caspar|Caspar]]"), recycling ("[[Magical Musketeer Wild|Wild]]" and "[[Magical Musketeer Doc|Doc]]"), advantage generators ("[[Magical Musketeer Kidbrave|Kidbrave]]" and "[[Magical Musket Mastermind Zakiel|Zakiel]]"), and even swarming ("[[Magical Musketeer Starfire|Starfire]]" and "[[Magical Musketeer Calamity|Calamity]]"). Therefore, it is important to get those monsters onto the field as fast as possible. Since they're all LIGHT Fiends, they can utilize "[[Ties of the Brethren]]" as their main card to swarm the field, most of the time to bring out "Caspar", "Doc", and "Kidbrave" for maximum benefits. Cards like "[[Double Summon]]" or "[[Time-Tearing Morganite]]" can also be used to emphasize this further.

  Since their monsters can activate their effects from the activation of ''any'' Spell/Traps, cards like "[[Upstart Goblin]]", "[[One Day of Peace]]" and the [[Toon]] engine (consisting of "[[Toon Table of Contents]]" and "[[Toon World]]") can also be used. Outside of "Starfire", they don't rely too much on Special Summoning, so they can use cards like "[[Pot of Duality]]" to increase their consistency without noticeable drawback.

  A "[[Fiendsmith]]" engine is also particularly useful in this archetype, as all the Musketeers are LIGHT Fiends that can easily Link into "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]" (Ideally, any Musketeer into "[[Magical Musketeer Max]]" then into "Requiem" to accumulate card advantage through Max's effect, or simply for an extra LIGHT Fiend in the GY). "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]" also provides an additional searching method for any Musketeer. "[[Fiendsmith's Lacrima]]" (Currently banned in TCG) can revive Musketeers in the GY. "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]" and "[[Fiendsmith's Sequence]]" can equip themselves onto Musketeers on the field to increase the equipped monster's chance of survival in the opponent's turn, keeping the Musket spells/traps in your hand live.

  === Weakness ===
  While powerful and consistent with their plethora of monster effects to generate advantage, it is also their greatest weakness. All "Magical Musket" Spells/Traps can only be activated while the player controls a "Magical Musket" monster, limiting their utility. Furthermore, they almost have no means of Special Summoning outside of their own theme (that doesn't rely on monster presence on the field), so any Summon negation cards such as "[[Forced Back]]", "[[Solemn Warning]]", "[[Chaos Trap Hole]]", and "[[Horn of Heaven]]" can help slow them down. Such Normal Summon dependence is this deck's major vulnerability when going second.

  [[Hand trap]]s are also effective against this Deck, particularly "[[Effect Veiler]]", "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]", "[[Herald of Orange Light]]", or "[[PSY-Framegear Gamma]]", since they can negate "Magical Musket" monster effects while also being out of reach from negation effect of "[[Magical Musket - Cross-Domination|Cross-Domination]]". Mass-removal cards that can avoid "[[Magical Musket - Last Stand|Last Stand]]" or "[[Magical Musket - Fiendish Deal|Fiendish Deal]]" are also effective to clear their entire field in one fell swoop, preventing them from activating more "Magical Musket" cards for the rest of that turn.

  == Trivia ==
  * This archetype can be considered as an antithesis to "[[The Weather]]" archetype, in many ways:
  ** "The Weather" focuses on using their monsters for their Spell/Trap effects, while this archetype uses their Spell/Traps to fuel their monsters, instead.
  ** "The Weather" has 4 Spells and 2 Traps, while this archetype has 2 Spells and 4 Traps.
  ** "The Weather" monsters are all [[Fairy]], while this archetype is all Fiend monsters.
  ** "[[The Weather Painter Rainbow]]" is an Extra Deck monster, while "[[Magical Musket Mastermind Zakiel]]" is a Main Deck monster.
  ** "[[The Weather Painter Aurora]]" protects "The Weather" Spells/Traps, while "[[Magical Musket - Fiendish Deal]]" protects this archetype's monsters.
  ** Both debuts in [[Deck-Build Pack: Spirit Warriors|''Deck-Build Pack: Spirit Warriors'']], and both are [[column]]-based archetypes.
