  "'''Cyber'''" (サイバー ''Saibā'') is an [[archetype]] of cards used by several characters across the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (manga)|manga]], most prominently [[Zane Truesdale]] and [[Alexis Rhodes]]. Users of this theme are referred to as practitioners of the "[[Cyber Style]]" in ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX''.

  While this is a wide-ranging archetype, monsters with "Cyber" in their name did not receive direct support until 2021. There are two primary groups of "Cyber" cards, sorted based on the [[Type]]s specified by their support cards.
  * [[Dragon]] and [[Machine]]-Types, based on cards used by Zane Truesdale, including the "[[Cyber Dragon (archetype)|Cyber Dragon]]" and "[[Cyberdark (disambiguation)|Cyberdark]]" archetypes. The first support for these monsters came from ''[[Structure Deck: Cyber Strike]]''. "[[Cyber Falcon]]", "[[Cyber Saurus]]", "[[Cyber Soldier of Darkworld]]", "[[Cyber-Stein]]", and "[[Cyber-Tech Alligator]]" are all Machine monsters which are ''not'' members due to their Japanese names; all have received an [[archetype-exclusion condition]] to resolve this. "[[Cyber Commander]]" and "[[Cyber Soldier]]" share this issue, but never received errata due to never being released outside of Japan.
  * [[Warrior]] and [[Fairy]]-Types, based on cards used by Alexis Rhodes, including the "[[Cyber Girl]]" [[series]] and the "[[Cyber Angel]]" archetype. The first support for all monsters in this group was "[[Prima Light]]" in ''[[Limited Pack GX: Slifer Red]]''.

  Spells/Traps in this archetype are supported since the release of "[[Cyber Dragon Core]]" in ''[[Cyber Dragon Revolution Structure Deck]]''. "[[Cybernetic]]" (サイバネティック) is a separate but related archetype of Spells/Traps; their members are technically not members of this archetype as their Japanese names do not contain 「サイバー」. In Japanese and German, the two archetypes are distinct; in other languages, the "Cybernetic" archetype functions as a sub-archetype of the "Cyber" archetype, due to the fact that the only cards that currently support the "Cybernetic" archetype in those languages also support the "Cyber" archetype at the same time.

  "[[Cyber Slash Harpie Lady]]" is additionally not a member of this archetype; however, since it is a monster that is not one of the Types supported in either group, this is not an issue. 
  == Design ==
  === Origin ===
  In the manga, some "Cyber" cards used by [[Zane Truesdale (manga)|Zane Truesdale]] are named after stars in the [[wikipedia:Draco (constellation)|Draco constellation]]. The theming of mechanical dragons named after the stars of Draco would later be reused for the "[[Drytron]]" archetype.
