  "'''Serket'''" (セルケト ''Seruketo'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Fairy]] monsters. Its original member, "[[Mystical Beast of Serket]]", was used by [[Odion]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|manga]] series. Its first support was only released in ''[[Maze of the Master]]''.

  This archetype works in conjunction with the [[Temple of the Kings (series)|Temple of the Kings]] series and the "[[Apophis]]" archetype.

  All members of this archetype have effects based around gaining [[ATK]] by battling the opponent's monsters. While "Mystical Beast of Serket" only gains 500 ATK when it destroys an opponent's monster by battle, its [[Mystical Beast Selket (manga)|original appearance in the manga]] was able to gain half of the destroyed monster's ATK. This trait was brought back with the newest members of the archetype, "[[Merciless Scorpion of Serket]]" and "[[Divine Scorpion Beast of Serket]]", both of which also gain half of the opponent's monsters' ATK. In addition, both of them only need to battle a monster, rather than destroying it, and "Divine Scorpion" can even [[banish]] an opponent's monster when it is Summoned to gain half of its ATK.
