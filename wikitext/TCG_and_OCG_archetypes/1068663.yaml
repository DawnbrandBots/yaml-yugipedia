  "'''Wedju'''" (ウェジュ ''Weju''), known as "'''Tablet'''" in the English dub of the anime, is a small [[archetype]] of [[Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s. They were used by [[Yami Bakura]] in the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime.

  ==Etymology==
  The name "Wedju" is derived from the Egyptian word "wedj", which refers to [[wikipedia:stele|stele]]. The tablets depicted in "Wedju" cards are based on those used for games of ''[[diaha]]'' in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime.

  ==Playing style==
  {{Main|Millennium#Playing style}}
