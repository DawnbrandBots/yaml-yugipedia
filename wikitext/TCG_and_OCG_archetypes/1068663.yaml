  "'''Wedju'''" (ウェジュ ''Weju''), known as "'''Tablet'''" in the English dub of the anime, is a small [[archetype]] of [[Spell Cards|Spell]]/[[Trap Cards]]. They were used by [[Yami Bakura]] in the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime.

  == Design ==
  The name "Wedju" is derived from the [[Ancient Egypt (place)|Ancient Egyptian]] goddess [[wikipedia:Wadjet|Wadjet]], associated with magical eye symbols, such as the [[Eye of Wdjat]]. The tablets depicted in "Wedju" cards are those used for games of ''[[diaha]]'' in the original series' lore.
