  "'''Wedju'''" (ウェジュ ''Weju''), also known as "'''Tablet'''" in the ''TCG'', is a small [[archetype]] of [[Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s. They were used by [[Yami Bakura]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime.

  ==Etymology==
  "Wedju" is a misspelling of the Egyptian word "wedj", which can refer to [[wikipedia:stele|stele]]. The tablets depicted in "Wedju" cards are based on those used for games of ''[[diaha]]'' in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga and anime.

  ==Playing style==
  {{Main|Millennium#Playing style}}
  In the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'', "Wedju" cards are part of the broader "[[Millennium]]" [[Deck]], itself typically part of "[[Exodia]]"/"[[Forbidden One]]" Deck.
