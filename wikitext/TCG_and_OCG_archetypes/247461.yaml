  "'''Dododo'''" (ドドド ''Dododo'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yuma Tsukumo]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (manga)|manga]]. Most of the members are based on [[wikipedia:Vikings|Vikings]] and consist of [[EARTH]] [[Warrior]] monsters, with the exception of "[[Dododo Bot]]" and "[[Dodododwarf Gogogoglove]]" (whose respective [[Types]] are [[Machine]] and [[Rock]]).

  The archetype name is derived from the Japanese onomatopoeia "do", which is used to describe the sound of thumping. This is reflected in how the archetype's most prominent member, "[[Dododo Warrior]]", was first [[Summon]]ed in the anime when its footstep created a large thumping noise.

  == Playing style ==
  The [[effect]]s of the [[Monster Card|monsters]], particularly "[[Dododo Buster]]", are designed to allow for easy [[Rank]] 4 and 6 [[Xyz Summon]]s. In addition, they all have respectable [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] on their own, and two of the five members of the archetype excel at dealing with opposing card effects when they [[attack]]; "[[Dododo Bot]]" cannot be affected by other cards (allowing it to punch through such defenses as "[[Dimensional Prison]]" unhindered), while "[[Dododo Warrior]]" [[negate]]s effects that would activate in the [[Graveyard]] such as "[[Necro Gardna]]".
  "[[Dododo Witch]]" allows you to Special Summon other "Dododo" monsters in either [[face-up]] [[Attack Position]] or [[face-down]] [[Defense Position]]. The former can be used to bypass the Summoning restrictions of "Dododo Bot", while the latter can be used to effectively Summon the Level 8 "[[Dododo Swordsman]]" and use its effects, letting it destroy two face-up monsters, and potentially turning it into a 3500 ATK beatstick.
  The newer "[[Heroic]]" cards, "[[Heroic Challenger - Knuckle Sword]]", "[[Heroic Challenger - Morning Star]]", "[[Heroic Call]]", and "[[Heroic Envoy]]", work very well with the archetype, giving them more swarming capabilities, deck thinning, damage output, and flexibility to make more Xyz of various ranks, such as the rank 1 "[[Heroic Champion - Jarngreipr]]".
