  "'''Dododo'''" (ドドド ''Dododo'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yuma Tsukumo]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (manga)|manga]]. Most of the members are based on [[wikipedia:Vikings|Vikings]] and consist of [[EARTH]] [[Warrior]] monsters, with the exception of "[[Dododo Bot]]" and "[[Dodododwarf Gogogoglove]]" (who are [[Machine]] and [[Rock]], respectively).

  ==Etymology==
  The archetype name is derived from the Japanese onomatopoeia "do", which is used to describe the sound of thumping. This is reflected in how the archetype's most prominent member, "[[Dododo Warrior]]", was first [[Summon]]ed in the anime when its footstep created a large thumping noise.

  == Playing style ==
  "Dododo" cards tend to focus on Summoning [[Rank 4 Monster Cards|Rank 4]] and [[Rank 6 Monster Cards|6]] monsters.
  * [[Dododo Buster]] can Special Summon itself as a Level 4 monster if only your opponent controls a monster, but if it is Tribute Summoned, it can Summon a "Dododo" monster from the GY.
  * [[Dododo Witch]] can Special Summon a "Dododo" card from hand.
  * [[Dododo Driver]], when Special Summoned by a "Dododo" monster, can increase or decrease a "Dododo" monster's level (by 1) up to twice per turn.

  Due to the small amount of archetypal cards, it is typically played alongside the other "[[Onomat]]" archetypes. In the current game, a few modern support cards ("[[Dodododwarf Gogogoglove]]" and "[[Utopic Onomatopoeia]]") can be played as part of a "[[Utopia]]"/"Onomat" Rank 4 strategy.
