  '''Radiant Typhoon''' ({{Ruby|絢|けん}}{{Ruby|嵐|らん}} ''Kenran'') is an archetype of [[WIND]] monsters introduced in ''[[Doom of Dimensions]]''. It revolves around "[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]", as well as both supporting and countering [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  The archetype's Japanese name is a play on 「{{Ruby|絢|けん}}{{Ruby|爛|らん}}」 (''kenran'', "dazzling"), with the second kanji replaced with 嵐 ("storm").

  Due to their association with "[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]" ("Cyclone" in the ''OCG''), the [[Level]] 9 "Radiant Typhoon" monsters are named after various mythological creatures and deities associated with rain, storm, or thunder, while the  the lower level monsters are named after [[wikipedia:tropical cyclones|tropical cyclone]] name in Asia.

  ==Playstyle==
  The archetype can be split into three groups:
  * The low Level monsters can be Special Summoned from the hand if "Mystical Space Typhoon" is in the controller's GY, or the opponent controls no Spells/Traps. With the exception of Meghala they each have an effect to search on Summon.
  * The high Level monsters can be Special Summoned from the hand if any Quick-Play Spell is activated and with the exception of Krosea can be Special Summoned from the GY whenever "Mystical Space Typhoon" is activated. They generally have disruptive effects.
  * The Spells/Traps can be Set if destroyed by "Mystical Space Typhoon", allowing "MST" to be activated and sent to GY on the first turn.
  ** The Quick-Play Spells can all add "MST" from Deck/GY or use their unique effect.

  Because the archetype supports all Quick-Play Spells, not only "MST", it can synergize with other Quick-Play centric archetypes, such as "[[Runick]]".
