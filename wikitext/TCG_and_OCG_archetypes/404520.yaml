  "'''Predaplant'''", known as "'''Predator Plants'''" ({{Ruby|捕食植物|プレデター・プランツ}} ''Puredetā Purantsu'') in Japan and "'''Predator Plant'''" in the English manga, is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Plant]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yuri]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|manga]]. The archetype is a sub-archetype of the "[[Predap]]" archetype.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  [[File:Predaplant.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Yuri]] with "[[Predaplant Moray Nepenthes (anime)|Predaplant Moray Nepenthes]]" and "[[Predaplant Squid Drosera (anime)|Squid Drosera]]" in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''.]]
  The monsters are largely based on [[wikipedia:Carnivorous plant|carnivorous plants]], [[wikipedia:Carrion flower|carrion flowers]], and/or carnivorous animals. Appearance wise, some "Predaplant" monsters have leaf-like mouth parts lined with thorn-like teeth, while their vine-like appendages resemble hands with thorn-like claws; the others have plant and animal characteristics. However, some Predaplant monsters are not based on carnivorous plants or carrion flowers; "[[Predaplant Cordyceps|Cordyceps]]" is based on a parasitic fungus with the same name, "[[Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio|Ophrys Scorpio]]" is based on a type of orchid whose flowers mimic female bees to fool males into pollinating them, "[[Predaplant Banksiogre|Banksiogre]]" is based on a genus of wildflower endemic to Australia, and "[[Predaplant Spider Orchid|Spider Orchid]]" is based on one of the most popular orchids in the trade.

  === Etymology ===
  The names of each monster is a hybridization of an animal and a plant. One of the words used is typically the Latin taxonomic name. The Level 5 and higher monsters are named after mythical creatures (chimera, dragon, hydra) and the Fusion Monsters are named after carrion flowers instead of carnivorous plants. Four "Predaplant" monsters, however, don't seem to follow this trend; "[[Predaplant Cordyceps|Cordyceps]]" is based on a fungus, "[[Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio|Ophrys Scorpio]]" and "[[Predaplant Spider Orchid|Spider Orchid]]" are based on two different orchids, and "[[Predaplant Banksiogre|Banksiogre]]" is based on an Australian wildflower.

  == Playing style ==
  "[[Predap]]" decks focus on swarming "Predaplant" monsters to [[Fusion Summon]] their boss [[Fusion Monster]]s for huge damage, destruction and disruption, while placing [[Predator Counter]]s on the opposing monsters to cripple the opponent and provide additional advantage to the user. Most significantly, the deck has a focus on using the opponent's monsters as tributes or Fusion Materials, fueling the player's own plays while removing opposing monsters. In addition to searching their own monsters, "Predaplant" also has a strong focus on searching "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]] or "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" Spells to help consistently gather their required cards for Fusion Summons.

  One of the most important members of the archetype is "[[Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio]]" which can [[Special Summon]] other "Predaplant" monsters from the Deck, with the most important choice being "[[Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra]]" which then lets the user search a "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" or "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" Spell. This is a useful engine that is utilized in decks oustide of pure "Predap" decks. The combo can only be used once per Duel but it is very potent, setting up either a [[Link Summon]] or a Rank 3 [[Xyz Summon]] alongside a Fusion Summon from cards like "[[Brilliant Fusion]]" and "[[Instant Fusion]]".

  Other searchers of the "Predap"/"Predaplant" archetype with useful additional effects include: "[[Predaplant Sarraceniant]]" (which acts as an emergency wall as it can be Special Summoned from the hand when the opponent makes a direct attack, can take down monsters that battle it and lets the player search a "Predap" card should it be sent from the field to the GY). "[[Predaplant Ambulomelides]]" (adds any "Predap" Spell/Trap or 1 "Predaplant" monster from the Deck, GY or face-up Extra Deck upon Fusion Summon, then can Tribute any monster that includes an opponent's monster with a Predator Counter to Special Summon any "Predaplant" monster from the Deck), "[[Predaplant Byblisp]]" (adds any "Predapant" monster when sent to the GY), "[[Predaplant Longinephila]]", "[[Predapractice]]" and "Predaplanet". The original "[[Polymerization]]" can also be searched with "[[Predaplant Lilizard]]", then it can be recycled with "Longinephila".

  Monsters with Predator Counters become [[Level]] 1 Monsters which can hinder opposing [[Ritual Summon|Ritual]], [[Synchro Summon|Synchro]] and [[Xyz Summon]]s or other Level-dependent plays. On the other hand, the user's "Predaplant" monsters are able to apply/activate most of their effects that require monsters with Predator Counters such as "Predaplant Byblisp" and "[[Predaplant Heliamphorhynchus]]" being able to Special Summon themselves while there are monsters with Predator Counters. "[[Predaplanet]]" is useful to keep in order to maintain card advantage each time a monster with Predator Counters inevitably leave the field. "Predap" cards which are effective in placing Predator Counters on monsters include "Predaplant Banksiogre", "[[Predaplant Spinodionaea]]", "[[Predaplant Squid Drosera]]", "[[Predaplanning]]" and "[[Predaplast]]".

  The most notable effects of the user's "Predaplant" monsters that interact with opposing monsters with Predator Counters are those that are able to remove opposing monsters with Predator Counters (particularly troublesome monsters that are otherwise diffcult to remove) by [[Tribute|Tributing]] them for Special Summoning "[[Predaplant Banksiogre]]" or "[[Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra]]" or as part of some "Predaplant" monsters' effects, as well as using the opposing monsters as [[Fusion Material]] with "[[Predaplant Chlamydosundew]]".

  Some "Predap" card effects generally support the Fusion Summon of DARK Fusion Monsters. The "Predaplant" Fusion Monsters range from being powerful [[beatstick]]s to having potent disruption effects that interact well with Predator Counters. "Predaplant Chimerafflesia" can steal some ATK of a monster when it attacks and can also banish low-Level monsters (i.e. monsters with a reduced Level while having Predator Counters), while being able to search a "Fusion" or "Polymerization" Spell should it be sent to the GY. "[[Predaplant Dragostapelia]]" can place Predator Counters on monsters at anytime while also negating the activated effects of monsters while they have Predator Counters. "[[Predaplant Triphyoverutum]]" can negate Extra Deck Special Summons, become a powerful beatstick while more monsters on the field have Predator Counters and it can revive itself from the GY. "Predaplant Ambulomeliodes" can be used to search or recover "Predap" cards and can Special Summon "Predaplants" from the Deck.

  Other DARK Fusion Monsters worth considering are those from the "[[Starving Venom]]" or "[[Fusion Dragon]]" archetypes, whose members are either related or are also members/support of "Predap", effectively serving as the archetype's boss monsters. "[[Starving Venom Fusion Dragon]]", and its upgraded counterparts, "[[Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon]]", "[[Starving Venom Predapower Fusion Dragon]]", "[[Starving Venom Fusion Dragon of the Four Heavenly Dragons]]" and "[[Starving Venom Wing Dragon]]" have various powerful effects that range from negating monsters' effects, altering their own ATK or an opponent's monster's ATK to 0, destroying cards and can revive themselves should they be destroyed (or have secondary usages in the case of "Starving Venom Wing Dragon" which as a [[Pendulum Monster]] in the Pendulum Zone, can constantly place Predator Counters on the opponent's monsters they have just Special Summoned).

  Despite being mainly Fusion-based, "Predaplant" can also utilize a small degree of [[Synchro Monster]]s, owing to their [[Tuner]] monsters "[[Predaplant Banksiogre]]", "[[Predaplant Longinephila]]", and their sole [[Tuner Synchro Monster]] "[[Predaplant Baalthea]]". "Baalthea" can revive any "Predaplant" or "Starving Venom" from the GY upon its "[[Synchro Summon]]", then once it is sent to the GY for a Synchro Summon, it can set up a Fusion Summon if a monster is Special Summoned to the opponent' field. In particular, the "Predaplant" Synchro strategy greatly benefits with using "[[Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]", which can negate the activations of up to 2 monsters' effects before fusing it away with "Baalthea" or "Starving Venom Fusion Dragon of the Four Heavenly Dragons" for "Starving Venom Wing Dragon" for a couple more disruptions.

  As with most [[Plant]] decks, "[[Lonefire Blossom]]" is useful for Summoning needed "Predaplant" monsters from the Deck.

  Due to "Predaplant" being heavily Fusion-focused, and its ability to search for "Fusion" or "Polymerization" Spells, the deck can implement a package of "[[Branded]]" cards. "[[Branded Fusion]]" is especially beneficial; acting as a starter for the theme by sending "Predaplant Byblisp" from Deck to Graveyard for fusing into "[[Lubellion the Searing Dragon]]". "Lubellion the Searing Dragon" can then Fusion Summon any Level 8 or lower Fusion Monster, allowing access to most "Predaplant" Fusion Monters.
