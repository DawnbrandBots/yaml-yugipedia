  "'''Predaplant'''", known as "'''Predator Plants'''" ({{Ruby|捕食植物|プレデター・プランツ}} ''Puredetā Purantsu'') in Japan and "'''Predator Plant'''" in the English manga, is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Plant]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yuri]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|manga]]. The archetype is a sub-archetype of the "[[Predap]]" archetype.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  [[File:Predaplant.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Yuri]] with "[[Predaplant Moray Nepenthes (anime)|Predaplant Moray Nepenthes]]" and "[[Predaplant Squid Drosera (anime)|Squid Drosera]]" in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''.]]
  The monsters are largely based on [[wikipedia:Carnivorous plant|carnivorous plants]], [[wikipedia:Carrion flower|carrion flowers]], and/or carnivorous animals. Appearance wise, some "Predaplant" monsters have leaf-like mouth parts lined with thorn-like teeth, while their vine-like appendages resemble hands with thorn-like claws; the others have plant and animal characteristics. However, some Predaplant monsters are not based on carnivorous plants or carrion flowers; "[[Predaplant Cordyceps|Cordyceps]]" is based on a parasitic fungus with the same name, "[[Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio|Ophrys Scorpio]]" is based on a type of orchid whose flowers mimic female bees to fool males into pollinating them, "[[Predaplant Banksiogre|Banksiogre]]" is based on a genus of wildflower endemic to Australia, and "[[Predaplant Spider Orchid|Spider Orchid]]" is based on one of the most popular orchids in the trade.

  === Etymology ===
  The names of each monster is a hybridization of an animal and a plant. One of the words used is typically the Latin taxonomic name. The Level 5 and higher monsters are named after mythical creatures (chimera, dragon, hydra) and the Fusion Monsters are named after carrion flowers instead of carnivorous plants. Four "Predaplant" monsters, however, don't seem to follow this trend; "[[Predaplant Cordyceps|Cordyceps]]" is based on a fungus, "[[Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio|Ophrys Scorpio]]" and "[[Predaplant Spider Orchid|Spider Orchid]]" are based on two different orchids, and "[[Predaplant Banksiogre|Banksiogre]]" is based on an Australian wildflower.

  == Playing style ==
  "[[Predap]]" decks focus on swarming "Predaplant" monsters to [[Fusion Summon]] their boss [[Fusion Monster]]s for huge damage, destruction and disruption, while placing [[Predator Counter]]s on the opposing monsters to cripple the opponent and provide additional advantage to the user. Most significantly, the theme has a focus on using the opponent's monsters as  [[Tribute]]s or [[Fusion Material]]s, fueling the user's own plays while removing opposing monsters. In addition to searching their own monsters, "Predaplant" also has a strong focus on searching "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]] or "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" [[Spell Card|Spells]] to help consistently gather their required cards for Fusion Summons.

  One of the most important members of the archetype is "[[Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio]]", which can [[Special Summon]] other "Predaplant" monsters from the Deck. The most notable choice for this is "[[Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra]]" which then lets the user search a "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" or "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" Spell. The effect of "Darlingtonia Cobra" can only be used once per Duel but it is very versatile, setting up either a [[Link Summon]] or a Rank 3 [[Xyz Summon]] alongside a Fusion Summon from cards like "[[Brilliant Fusion]]" and "[[Instant Fusion]]". This is a useful engine that is utilized in decks outside of pure "Predap" decks.

  Other searchers of the "Predap"/"Predaplant" archetype with useful additional effects include "[[Predaplant Sarraceniant]]" (which can Special Summon itself to block an opponent's monster's attack, can destroy monsters that battle it and searches a "Predap" card when it destroyed or sent to the GY by card effect), "[[Predaplant Ambulomelides]]" (adds any "Predap" Spell/Trap or 1 "Predaplant" monster from the Deck, GY or face-up Extra Deck upon Fusion Summon, and can Tribute any monster on the field with a Predator Counter to Special Summon any "Predaplant" monster from the Deck), "[[Predaplant Byblisp]]" (searches any "Predaplant" monster when sent to the GY), "[[Predaplant Longinephila]]" (searches a "Predap" card on Summon), "[[Predapractice]]" (Special Summons a "Predaplant" monster from your hand and searches any other "Predap" card), and "[[Predaplanet]]" (which searches any other "Predap" card if a monster with a Predator Counter leaves the field). The original "[[Polymerization]]" can also be searched with "[[Predaplant Lilizard]]", then recycled with the GY effect of "Longinephila".

  Monsters with Predator Counters become [[Level]] 1 Monsters, which can hinder opposing [[Ritual Summon|Ritual]], [[Synchro Summon|Synchro]] and [[Xyz Summon]]s or other Level-dependent plays. In addition, the user's "Predaplant" monsters are able to apply/activate most of their effects using monsters with Predator Counters. Monsters such as "Predaplant Byblisp" and "[[Predaplant Heliamphorhynchus]]" can Special Summon themselves from the GY or hand respectively while a monster with a Predator Counter is on the field, and other older "Predaplant" monsters like "[[Predaplant Spinodionaea|Spinodionaea]]" utilize the lower Levels of monsters with Predator Counters. "[[Predaplanet]]" is useful to have on the field in order to maintain card advantage. "Predap" cards which are effective in placing Predator Counters on monsters include "[[Predaplant Banksiogre]]", "Predaplant Longinephila", "Predaplant Spinodionaea", "[[Predaplant Squid Drosera]]", "[[Predaplanning]]" and "[[Predaplast]]".

  The most notable disruption effects of "Predaplant" monsters involve removing opposing monsters with Predator Counters (particularly monsters that are otherwise diffcult to remove) by Tributing them for Special Summoning "Predaplant Banksiogre" or "[[Predaplant Drosophyllum Hydra]]" or as part of some "Predaplant" monsters' effects, as well as using the opposing monsters as [[Fusion Material]] with "[[Predaplant Chlamydosundew]]".

  Some "Predap" card effects more generically support the Fusion Summon of DARK Fusion Monsters. The "Predaplant" Fusion Monsters range from being powerful [[beatstick]]s to having potent disruption effects that interact with monsters with Predator Counters. "Predaplant Chimerafflesia" can steal 1000 ATK from a monster it battles and can also banish low-Level monsters (i.e. monsters with a reduced Level due to having a Predator Counter), and searches a "Fusion" or "Polymerization" Spell during the next Standby Phase after it is sent to the GY. "[[Predaplant Dragostapelia]]" can place Predator Counters on opposing monsters at anytime and negates the activated effects of monsters while they have Predator Counters. "[[Predaplant Triphyoverutum]]" can negate Special Summons from the Extra Deck, gains the original ATK of all other monsters with Predator Counters, and can revive itself from the GY.

  Other DARK Fusion Monsters worth considering are those from the "[[Starving Venom]]" or "[[Fusion Dragon]]" archetypes, whose members are either related to or are also members/support of "Predap"/ "Predaplant", effectively serving as the theme's boss monsters. "[[Starving Venom Fusion Dragon]]" and its upgraded counterparts ("[[Greedy Venom Fusion Dragon]]", "[[Starving Venom Predapower Fusion Dragon]]", "[[Starving Venom Fusion Dragon of the Four Heavenly Dragons]]" and "[[Starving Venom Wing Dragon]]") have various powerful effects that range from negating monsters' effects, altering their own ATK, changing an opponent's monster's ATK to 0, and destroying monsters. Several of these "Fusion Dragons" can revive themselves upon destruction (or have secondary usages in the case of "Starving Venom Wing Dragon", which as a [[Pendulum Monster]] in the Pendulum Zone, can constantly place Predator Counters on monsters the opponent Special Summons).

  Despite being mainly Fusion-based, "Predaplant" can also utilize a small arsenal of [[Synchro Monster]]s, owing to their [[Tuner]] monsters "Banksiogre", "Longinephila", and their sole [[Tuner Synchro Monster]] "[[Predaplant Baalthea]]". "Baalthea" can revive any "Predaplant" or "Starving Venom" monster from the GY upon its [[Synchro Summon]]. Then once "Baalthea" is sent to the GY for a Synchro Summon, it lets the user Fusion Summon by banishing itself and "Polymerization" from the GY if a monster is Special Summoned to the opponent's field. In particular, the "Predaplant" Synchro strategy greatly benefits with using "[[Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]", which can negate the activations of up to 2 monsters' effects before being fused away with a Fusion Monster for "Starving Venom Wing Dragon", offering more disruption.

  "[[Predaplant Verte Anaconda]]" is a generic Link-2 [[Link Monster]] that can turn change a monster's [[Attribute]] on the field to DARK, and send a "Fusion"/"Polymerization" Normal or Quick-Play Spell from the Deck to apply its activation effect.

  As with most [[Plant]] decks, "[[Lonefire Blossom]]" is useful for Special Summoning "Predaplant" monsters from the Deck. "[[Draselea the Blood Tree Dragon Princess]]" is a Level 1 DARK Plant Tuner which is extremely useful for setting up most "Predaplant" strategies.

  Due to "Predaplant" decks being heavily Fusion-focused, and their ability to search for "Fusion" or "Polymerization" Spells, the deck can implement a package of "[[Branded]]" cards. "[[Branded Fusion]]" is especially beneficial, acting as a starter for the theme by sending "Predaplant Byblisp" from Deck to Graveyard for fusing into "[[Lubellion the Searing Dragon]]". "Lubellion the Searing Dragon" can then Fusion Summon any Level 8 or lower Fusion Monster, while "Byblisp" can search another "Predaplant", allowing access to most "Predaplant" Fusion Monters or a "Predap" combo starter.
