  "'''Cyberdark'''", spelled "'''Cyber Dark'''" (サイバー・ダーク ''Saibā Dāku'') in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] and [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]], as well as a sub-archetype of the "[[Cyber]]" archetype. These cards were used by [[Zane Truesdale]] following his "rebirth" in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime as a forbidden "Underworld Deck" (called "Cyber Art Reverse" in the original).

  == Anime ==
  In the anime, the Deck's unquenchable thirst for battle and improvement forces its owner to go past his/her limit, slowly damaging the user's body over time. Because of this drawback, only Duelists with strong wills and dreams of progression can use this Deck for long periods of time. Depending on how strong-willed the Duelist is, the Duelist using this Deck will experience heart trauma, which may lead to death, as displayed by Zane Truesdale after using this Deck for so long. Even [[Syrus Truesdale]] experienced some cardiovascular pain when he decided to take over Zane's Duel against [[Makoto Inotsume]]. However, Syrus was able to overcome this problem by respecting the Deck, something that Zane had not done.

  The "Cyberdark" monsters' equipping effects are represented as cables connecting to the Dragon monster's head and locking the monster in place with their claws.

  == Playing style ==
  "Cyberdark" cards can be split into three waves:
  * The original cards released in 2006 - 2007, reliant on equipping Dragons from the GY.
  * Support released in ''[[Legendary Duelist]]s'', aimed to increase consistency, get required cards to the GY, and support "Cyberdark" monsters equipped with a card.
  * Modern cards released in ''[[Structure Deck: Cyber Strike]]'' onwards.

  The original "Cyberdark" strategy focused on [[Beatdown]]/[[Control]], using its Normal Summons to (ideally) overpower the opponent. On Normal Summon, "[[Cyberdark Horn|Horn]]", "[[Cyberdark Edge|Edge]]", and "[[Cyberdark Keel|Keel]]" can each equip a Level 3 or lower Dragon to gain its ATK, and have their own battle-oriented effects. These never saw much play, due to the clunkiness of their gimmick.

  The modern "Cyberdark" cards are often used as an engine within "Cyber Dragon", including:

  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Card
  ! Description
  |-
  | [[Cyberdark Claw]]<br>[[Cyberdark Cannon]]
  | "Claw" can discard itself to search a "Cyberdark" Spell, while "Cannon" discards itself to searches a "Cyberdark" monster. Both are consistency tools that help get "Cyberdarks" to the GY for Fusion Material (and are Level 3 Dragons, to help the original Cyberdarks). When equipped to a monster, "Claw" sends a monster from Deck to GY, and "Cannon" sends a monster from Extra Deck to GY.
  |- 
  | [[Cyberdark Chimera]]
  | On field, can discard a Spell/Trap to search "Power Bond", then allow a Fusion Summon by banishing from the GY, but locks Fusions into "Cyber" cards. When sent to the GY, it can mill a "Cyberdark" card from Deck to GY.
  |-
  | [[Cyberdark Wurm]]
  | (Prerelease) The main target for "Chimera" for "Cyber Dragon". Can Summon itself from the GY, milling a "Cyber" monster as [[cost]], while adding a "Cyber" Spell/Trap from GY to hand. 
  |-
  | [[Cybernetic Horizon]]
  | A way to easily get "Cyber" monsters in the GY. Sends a "Cyber" monster from hand, a "Cyber" monster from Deck, and a "Cyber" Fusion Monster from Extra Deck, while adding a "Cyber" monster from Deck to hand.
  |- 
  | [[Cyberdark Realm]]
  | Searches a "Cyberdark" monster, and allows an extra Normal Summon of a "Cyberdark" monster. Also allows "Cyberdark" monsters to equip from the opposing GY.
  |}

  "Cyber Dragon" cards, in turn, can be used to help "Cyberdark":
  * "[[Cyber Dragon Core]]" can search "Cybernetic Horizon" or other "[[Cyber]]" Spell/Traps.
  * "[[Cyber Dragon Herz]]" can activate its effect if sent to the GY by "Horizon" and provide further consistency. 
  * "[[Cyber Dragon Nachster]]" can Special Summon "Cyberdark Chimera" from the GY so it can search "Power Bond" without using the Normal Summon. 
  * "Chimeratech Rampage Dragon" can be Summoned by using copies of the "Cyber Dragon" monsters and has immense OTK potential, especially if Summoned with the help of "Power Bond" and "Cyberdark Chimera". 
  * "[[Cyber Dragon Sieger]]" adds further OTK potential to this Deck by increasing the ATK of any Machine monster with 2100 or more ATK by another 2100, thus including the "Cyberdark" Machine monster with sufficiently strong Equip Cards.

  The following cards can be used in a more "Cyberdark"-centric strategy:
  * "[[Cyberdark Inferno]]" can protect "Cyberdark" monsters from being targeted or destroyed by opponents' card effects while equipped with a card, and also allows the player to return a "Cyberdark" monster to the hand and Normal Summon it again to change or restore the monster equipped to it. Its effect when destroyed can search for a "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" or "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" Spell Card, such as "[[Overload Fusion]]". 
  * "[[Cyberdark Dragon]]" and "[[Cyberdarkness Dragon]]" are the in-house Fusions, which can equip any Dragon monster (or Machine, for "Cyberdarkness") to gain its ATK. "Cyberdarkness" can also act as an omni-negate by sending an equipped card to the GY.

  === Equip options ===
  Modern options for the original three "Cyberdarks" include:
  * "[[Attachment Cybern]]" grants a total of 3000 [[ATK]] if equipped by the Cyberdark effect.
  * "Cannon" and "Claw" can search out a "Cyberdark" card while sending themselves to the GY, have on-equip mill effects, and have the 2nd highest original ATK.
  * "[[Dragon Buster Destruction Sword]]" can prevent the opponent from Summoning monsters from their [[Extra Deck]].
  * "[[Leng Ling]]", while having only 1500 ATK, will also set the ATK of any "Cyberdark" it is equipped to at 2500 ATK and allow it to attack twice, and it can Summon itself to the [[field]] while [[equip]]ped.

  In legacy formats, "[[Hunter Dragon]]" will be the highest ATK target, resulting in 2500 ATK for the Level 4 "Cyberdark" monsters.

  High-Level Dragon monsters are usually kept to a minimum, as they can only be equipped by the Fusion monsters, and two of the Fusions ("Cyberdarkness" and "Cyberdark End Dragon") can also equip Machines. For the latter two, "[[Cybernetic Horizon]]" can be used to send a high ATK monster like "Cyber End Dragon" from the Extra Deck as equip material.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The [[Deck]] is very heavily reliant on [[Normal Summon]]ing.
  * The Deck can constantly Summon high-[[ATK]] monsters with little investment, but due to the "Cyberdark" monsters boosting their [[ATK]] themselves up via an [[equip]]ped card, they are vulnerable to all forms of removal, even under "[[Cyberdark Inferno]]'s" protection.
  * Cards that lock access to the [[Graveyard]] such as "[[Necrovalley]]" or "[[Macro Cosmos]]".
