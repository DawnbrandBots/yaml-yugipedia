  "'''Abyss-'''" (アビス ''Abisu'') is an [[archetype]] of cards that support "[[Mermail]]" monsters or "[[Umi]]".
  While monsters that are part of the archetype have existed in the ''[[TCG]]'' and ''[[OCG]]'' since ''[[Spell of Mask]]'' and ''[[Labyrinth of Nightmare]]'', no [[support]] or cards that meet the requirements of support were introduced until ''[[Abyss Rising]]''.
  Due to their Japanese names, a number of monsters (mostly [[WATER]] monsters), such as "[[Abyss Soldier]]" and "[[Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss]]" also fall into this archetype. However, because ''TCG'' and ''OCG'' support for this archetype only works on [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s that are not on the [[field]], this is not an issue.
