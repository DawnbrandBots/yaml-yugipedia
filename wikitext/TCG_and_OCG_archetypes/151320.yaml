  "'''Nordic Ascendant'''", known as "'''Polar Star Angel'''" ({{Ruby|極|きょく}}{{Ruby|星|せい}}{{Ruby|天|てん}} ''Kyokuseiten'') in the Japanese ''[[OCG]]'' and the anime, are a sub-archetype of the "[[Nordic]]" archetype. They are a group of [[Fairy]] monsters used by [[Halldor]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime.

  == Design ==
  The "Nordic Ascendant" monsters are based on legendary human and divine figures found in Norse mythology. Most of the monsters' mythological counterparts are related to the Norse God [[wikipedia:Odin|Odin]]:
  * "[[Mimir of the Nordic Ascendant|Mimir]]" is based on [[wikipedia:Mímir|Mímir]], a Norse God renowned for his wisdom and knowledge, whose head is carried by Odin to provide him with knowledge.
  * "[[Valkyrie of the Nordic Ascendant|Valkyrie]]" is based on the [[wikipedia:Valkyrie|Valkyries]], a host of female figures who serve under Odin, and are responsible for bringing dead warriors to the afterlife and into the [[wikipedia:Valhalla|Halls of Valhalla]] (where they become [[wikipedia:Einherjar|Einherjars]]).
  ** ''Vanadis'' is another name for the Vanir Goddess [[wikipedia:Freyja|Freyja]], who in some sources is depicted as the queen of the Valkyries.
  ** ''Gullveig'' is also theorized by some scholars to be or be connected to Freyja.
  * The [[wikipedia:Einherjar|Einherjar]], featured in the "[[Einherjar Token]]s", are an army of fallen that were brought to [[wikipedia:Valhalla|Valhalla]] to be part of [[wikipedia:Odin|Odin]]'s army for the inevitable day of [[wikipedia:Ragnarök|Ragnarök]].
  In gameplay, the "Nordic Ascendant" monsters are associated with "[[Odin, Father of the Aesir]]". Most "Nordic Ascendant" monsters have effects to Special Summon monsters and enable combos.
