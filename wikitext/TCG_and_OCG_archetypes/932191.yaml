  [[File:VirtualWorldKyubiShenshen-ConceptArt.png|thumb|left|200px|Concept art for "[[Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen]]"]]
  The "Virtual World" monsters have designs based on Chinese and Japanese mythological animals and individuals, with sleek and cybernetic appearances similar to that of [[Cyberse]] monsters. Every "Virtual World" monster is either humanoid in appearance or has the appearance of an animal robot (except "[[Virtual World Oto-Hime - Toutou]]", which has both a humanoid and animal robot in its artwork).
  ===Etymology===
  The archetype's Japanese name, 「電脳堺」 (''Dennōkai''), is composed of the word 「電脳」 (''Dennō'') and the character 「堺」 (''Kai''). 「電脳」 is a non-standard Japanese word for "computer" borrowed from the Chinese word for computer, ''diànnǎo'' (Simplified: 电脑, Traditional: 電腦), and in Japanese usage is typically used for stylistic effect. 「堺」, read as ''jiè'' in Chinese, is a [[wikipedia:Variant Chinese character|variant character]] for the character 界 (''jiè''), meaning "realm".
  Individual "Virtual World" monsters feature a title and a given name. The title is made of up of 「電脳堺」 (''Dennōkai'') plus an additional title character, read in on'yomi (just like ''Dennōkai'' itself). The given name meanwhile always consists of a single [[wikipedia:Reduplication|reduplicated]] Chinese character, with the second character written using the [[wikipedia:Iteration mark|kanji repetition character]], 「々」.
  Additionally, the given name is always read using an approximation of the character's Mandarin Chinese reading (applied as ''furigana'', written in ''katakana''), instead of the Japanese ''on'yomi'' reading. For instance, the given name of "[[Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen]]", "Shenshen", is 「{{Ruby|仙|シェン}}{{Ruby|々|シェン}}」 (''Shenshen'') in Japanese. The standard Japanese ''on'yomi'' reading of 「仙」 is ''sen'', but it is read as ''shen'' because it approximates the Chinese reading for 仙, ''xiān''.

  ==Playing style==
  "Virtual World" focuses on [[Synchro Summon|Synchro]] and [[Xyz Summon|Xyz]] Summoning monsters with [[Level]]s/[[Rank]]s that are multiples of 3. All members of the archetype have [[Level]]s/[[Rank]]s consisting of multiples of 3, at either 3, 6, or 9, and the [[Main Deck]] members have effects that allows them to Special Summon themselves from the hand or GY. Secondarily, "Virtual World" cards have effects focusing on banishing cards and recurring banished cards.
  Four of the six [[Main Deck]] "Virtual World" members share the following [[once per turn]] effect to Special Summon themselves from the [[hand]]:
  :"''If this card is in your [[hand]]: You can [[target]] 1 "Virtual World" card you [[control]]; [[send]] 1 "Virtual World" card of a different type ([[Monster]], [[Spell]], [[Trap]]) from your [[Main Deck|Deck]] to the [[GY]], and if you do, [[Special Summon]] this card, then, [Additional Effect].''"

  </references>
  These shared and individual effects let the Deck easily [[swarm]] the [[field]] and [[mill]] their deck for useful cards, setting up their [[Synchro Summon|Synchro]] and [[Xyz Summon|Xyz]] plays. Using these effects applies a restriction to the player, that the rest of this turn, the player can only Special Summon [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 3 or higher monsters; this restriction fully disables [[Link Summoning]].
  Two "Virtual World" main deck monsters, "[[Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan]]" and "[[Virtual World Oto-Hime - Toutou]]", deviate from the other monsters' shared effects, and instead have effects that lets them Special Summon themselves from the GY as [[Tuner]] monsters. Using these effects will also apply the shared restriction as the other "Virtual World" monsters' Special Summon effects.
  The "[[Virtual World Gate]]" [[Continuous Spell]] and [[Continuous Trap|Trap]] cards are the main targets for the targeting requirement in the Special Summon effects of the "Virtual World" monsters, as they allow "Virtual World" monsters to mill "Virtual World" monsters to make plays. "[[Virtual World City - Kauwloon]]" is the Deck's main searcher for "Virtual World Gate" cards, being able to directly place them from the Deck face-up in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] - bypassing cards like "[[Denko Sekka]]".
  Each "Virtual World Gate" card has two effects: a disruptive effect on the field, and a second supportive effect in the GY that require banishing themselves as cost. Notably, the GY effects of the "Virtual World Gate" Trap cards can ''only'' be activated in the player's own [[Main Phase]].

  The Deck's swarming ability gives it a wide range of Level/Rank 3/6/9 [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] and [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] Extra Deck options, among which includes its in-achetype Extra Deck monsters. "Virtual World" Extra Deck monsters have largely generic summoning conditions and effects, providing board-breaking ("[[Virtual World Beast - Jiujiu|Jiujiu]]", "[[Virtual World Phoenix - Fanfan|Fanfan]]", "[[Virtual World Shell - Jaja|Jaja]]"), disruption ("[[Virtual World Dragon - Longlong|Longlong]]"), and [[Floodgate|floodgating]] ("[[Virtual World Kyubi - Shenshen|Shenshen]]") effects, and loosely synergize with the Deck's use of banishing and its combination of monster Types and Attributes. Some notable external Extra Deck options include "[[Vermillion Dragon Mech]]" or "[[Number 39: Utopia Beyond]]", but easily the most notable and powerful option among them is "[[True King of All Calamities]]", which was the Deck's primary boss monster at its peak performance.
  The archetype is typically played pure due to its requirements for "Virtual World" cards to activate its monsters' effects. Externally, the Deck primarily benefits from generic consistency cards like "[[Emergency Teleport]]". The archetype has situational synergy with "[[PSY-Framelord Omega]]" (usually summoned when the player is using "[[PSY-Frame]]" monsters as generic [[hand trap]]s), as it can return banished cards to the GY.
