  "'''Azamina'''" (アザミナ ''Azamina'') is an archetype of [[Illusion]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] (mostly [[DARK]] [[Fusion Monster|Fusions]]) introduced in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]''. It is part of the "[[Sinful Spoils]]" storyline.

  == Design ==
  The archetype primarily consists of monstrous, corrupted versions of "Sinful Spoils" cards, seemingly under the influence of "[[Queen Azamina]]".

  === Etymology ===
  As shown by the Japanese name of "[[The Hallowed Azamina]]", "Azamina" is derived from the Japanese word 「薊花」 (''azamibana'', "[[wikipedia:thistle|thistle]] flower"). Fittingly, prickled plants are prominently depicted emerging from the body of every monster and in the foreground of most of cards in the archetype.

  == Playstyle ==
  "Azamina" is a Fusion-based archetype closely tied to the "[[Sinful Spoils]]" archetype. Their most commonly played Fusion spell, "[[The Hallowed Azamina]]", can Fusion Summon by sending "Sinful Spoils" cards (1 card per 4 levels, rounded down) to the GY.

  === As an engine ===
  The archetype can be played as a small engine - consisting of "[[Deception of the Sinful Spoils]]", "[[The Hallowed Azamina]]", and "[[Azamina Ilia Silvia]]" - in order to get " Ilia Silvia's" omni-negate in 1 summon. "[[Diabellstar the Black Witch]]" and "[[WANTED: Seeker of Sinful Spoils]]" act as ways to search "Deception" and can be run as needed.

  If playing another "Sinful Spoils"-related archetype, "[[Azamina Mu Rcielago]]" should also be run as a way to search any "Sinful Spoils" card. Summon "Mu Rcielago" first, send it to the GY as material/cost, then activate "The Hallowed Azamina's" GY effect to use it again.
