  "'''Azamina'''" (アザミナ ''Azamina'') is an archetype of [[Illusion]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] (mostly [[DARK]] [[Fusion Monster|Fusions]]) introduced in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]''. It is part of the "[[Sinful Spoils]]" storyline.

  == Design ==
  The archetype primarily consists of monstrous, corrupted versions of "Sinful Spoils" cards, seemingly under the influence of "[[Queen of the Azamina]]".

  === Etymology ===
  As shown by the Japanese name of "[[The Hallowed Azamina]]", "Azamina" is derived from the Japanese word 「薊花」 (''azamibana'', "[[wikipedia:thistle|thistle]] flower"). Fittingly, prickled plants are prominently depicted emerging from the body of every monster and in the foreground of most of cards in the archetype.
