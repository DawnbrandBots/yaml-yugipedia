  "'''Azamina'''" (アザミナ ''Azamina'') is an archetype of [[DARK]] [[Illusion]] [[Fusion Monster]]s introduced in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]''.

  This archetype is part of the "[[Diabellstar]]" storyline and is related to the "[[Sinful Spoils]]" archetype.

  == Design ==
  The archetype consists of monster versions of "[[Sinful Spoils]]" cards and corrupted versions of "[[White Forest]]" monsters.

  === Etymology ===
  "Azamina" is derived from the Japanese word 「薊」 (''azami'', "thistle"). Fittingly, each monster has prickled plants emerging from its body, and prickled plants are prominent in the foreground of most of cards in the archetype.
