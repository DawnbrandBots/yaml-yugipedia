  "'''Amorphage'''" (アモルファージ ''Amorufāji'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Dragon]] [[Pendulum Monster]]s that debuted in ''[[Shining Victories]]''. The archetype is part of the "[[Dracoslayer]]" storyline, and is strongly connected to the "[[Dracoverlord]]" archetype in both lore and gameplay.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  The "Amorphage" monsters appear as normal animals that are mutating into draconic monstrosities, with the Level 2, 4, and 6 monsters being in the process of transformation and the Level 8 already fully transformed. Each monster bears small eye-like gouges in their bodies, as well as a protrusion that resembles the body of a [[wikipedia:Enterobacteria phage T4|T4 virus]]. This also adorns the staff carried by "[[Vector Pendulum, the Dracoverlord]]", who is also related to the "Dracoslayer" archetype—suggesting that the "Amorphages" are a result, if not ''the'' result, of the "Dragon Alchemy" employed by "Vector Pendulum" to create his minions.

  The [[original ATK and DEF]] of each "Amorphage" monster varies with the stage of their transformation, and often either their ATK or DEF are 0. Monsters whose original body has not lost vital features (e.g. "Envy") have 0 ATK, possibly due to still struggling against their involuntary metamorphosis and only lashing out in self-defense. Monsters with sufficiently functioning draconic bodies (e.g. "Sloth" and the perfected "Goliath") have 0 DEF, signifying that they no longer have control of their new form or its bloodlust.
  The presence of the original form also seems to influence how much ATK the latter type have; - though "Lechery" has a functioning draconic body, it has not yet overtaken the creature's original form, and has somewhat low ATK; conversely, "Sloth" has all but consumed its original body, and has a much high ATK. The stages of transformation also seem to be linked to how reliant on the Pendulum Scales the monsters are - e.g., "Amorphage Sloth" and "Goliath" do not need to be Pendulum Summoned or Flipped face-up in order to prevent both players from Summoning non-"Amorphage" monsters from the Extra Deck. In addition, many of their [[floodgate]] Pendulum effects require monsters as regular Tributes, suggesting that they must continually consume living beings in order to fully transform.

  === Etymology ===
  "Amorphage" is a portmanteau of "amorphous" and "[[wikipedia:Bacteriophage|bacteriophage]]".
  The ''OCG'' names of the "Amorphage" monsters are derived from Latin or Greek words corresponding to the [[wikipedia:Seven deadly sins#Origin of the currently recognized seven deadly sins|eight evil thoughts]], precursors of the [[wikipedia:Seven deadly sins|seven deadly sins]]; the implication is that both their bodies and their minds have been altered by "Vector Pendulum, the Dracoverlord" into vile and deadly dragons. The ''TCG'' names are instead derived directly from the seven deadly sins.

  == Playing style ==
  "Amorphage" is a [[stun]] archetype - each "Amorphage" Pendulum Monster has a [[floodgate]] effect as a monster or Pendulum Scale. They share the following effects:

  * Pendulum Effect: While you control an "Amorphage" monster, [apply floodgate effect]. During the Standby Phase, Tribute 1 monster or destroy this card.
  * Monster Effect: Neither player can Special Summon monsters from the Extra Deck, except "Amorphage" monsters. 
  ** The low Level monsters only apply this effect if Pendulum Summoned or flipped up, while the high Level monsters do not have any restrictions.

  |}

  Their effects are balanced around the Pendulum mechanic, with the Pendulum Summon providing easy access to Tribute material each turn. However, because the "Amorphage" monsters all have Scales 3 or 5 (only allowing Pendulum Summon 4), the higher Level monsters are harder to Summon.

  The archetype features three supporting Spell/Traps: "[[Amorphous Persona]]", which draws cards when an "Amorphage" monster is Tributed, "[[Amorphage Infection]]", which searches when a monster is Tributed, and "[[Amorphage Lysis]]", which replaces a Pendulum Scale when a card in the Pendulum Zone is destroyed. Each of them also provide battle support via stat boosts and debuffs. These cards provide recovery for the Deck's heavy maintenance costs.

  The archetype is connected to a thematically related (but gameplay-wise largely separate) Ritual boss monster "[[Amorphactor Pain, the Imagination Dracoverlord]]". It can be Ritual Summoned by the GY effect of "Amorphous Persona", and has a floodgate effect on the field. However, 

  Externally, the archetype can potentially be mixed with other Pendulum archetypes, primarily the "Dracoslayer" and "Dracoverlord" archetypes, to provide floodgates to their end boards. The archetype can also be used to support other [[Dragon]] strategies, with cards like "[[Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres]]" and "[[Chasma, Dragon Ruler of Auroras]]" able to cheat out the higher Level members of the archetype.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * All "Amorphage" Pendulum Effects include a stipulation that the controller must also control an "Amorphage" monster. Without that, none of their Pendulum Effects apply, and the Deck's biggest strength is gone.
  * As all "Amorphage" monsters have either 0 ATK or 0 DEF, "[[Doom Donuts]]" can decimate an established field.
  * As a stun archetype, it can do little when forced to go second.
  * The archetype suffers from various weaknesses of the Pendulum mechanic:
  ** It takes multiple cards to set up a floodgate, being a 2-card combo at minimum and more realistically a 3-4 card combo.
  ** If the Pendulum Scales are destroyed, e.g. with "[[Twin Twister]]" or "[[Wavering Eyes]]", the significant loss of resources will make it difficult to establish or maintain the floodgate effects.
  ** The [[Master Rule 4|New Master Rule]] has hurt the archetype significantly, making it harder to get enough Tributes each turn to maintain the Pendulum Scales. Due to the archetype's own restrictions, it is impossible to Summon [[Link Monster]]s without external support. Also, as an archetype reliant on backrow (for other floodgates, the archetype's Continuous Spells/Traps, and [[token]] generators), the loss of Spell/Trap Zones is difficult to deal with.
  * Floodgates:
  ** Anti-Special Summon/Pendulum floodgates, like "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]" and "[[Dimensional Barrier]]".
  ** Anti-Tribute floodgates, like "[[Fog King]]" and "[[Mask of Restrict]]" will prevent the Pendulum Scales from staying on field.
