  "'''Ashened'''" ({{Ruby|灰|かい}}{{Ruby|滅|めつ}} ''Kaimetsu'') is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Pyro]] monsters which first debuted in ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]''.

  == Design ==
  The archetype is likely based on [[wikipedia:Pompeii|Pompeii]], an ancient city that was once located in what is now a region in [[wikipedia:Italy|Italy]] but was buried under [[wikipedia:Volcanic ash|volcanic ash]] after the eruption of [[wikipedia:Mount Vesuvius|Mt. Vesuvius]] in 79 AD. Visually, it also seems to draw inspiration from the ''[[wikipedia:Dark Souls|Dark Souls]]'' franchise.

  === Etymology ===
  The word "ashened" usually refers to something or someone devoid of color, but can also mean something that has been reduced to ash, referencing the theme's backstory. Its Japanese name is a play on 「{{Ruby|壊|かい}}{{Ruby|滅|めつ}}」 (''kaimetsu'', "annihilation"), with the first kanji replaced with 「灰」 ("ash"), emphasizing the second meaning. The other ''TCG'' names use terms for both interpretations, with French and Portuguese leaning towards coloration while German, Italian, and Spanish use a direct equivalent of "incinerated".

  === Members ===
  Aesthetically, all "Ashened" monsters carry a similar color scheme of dullish gray tones across their bodies, armor, and hair accented through faded blue clothes and orange accents across their bodies stylized like sears from the flames that ended their civilization. In comparison, "[[Veidos the Eruption Dragon of Extinction]]" carries with it a striking design with glowing magenta accents and claw-like appendages attached to its head with a separate set of wings attached to those.

  As for the [[Fusion Monster]]s, both are showcased as evolutions of "Hero" and "Veidos" respectively through various means:

  * "[[Embers of the Ashened]]" showcases "Hero" having been entirely consumed by the ashes of his people and transformed into a hulking grey monster covered in orange accents, likely with the lone goal of finally defeating "Veidos", as shown in "[[Extinguishing the Ashened]]"
  * "[[Veidos the Dragon of Endless Darkness]]" meanwhile shows "Veidos" absorbing the souls of the "Ashened" monsters and transforming into a darker form with blue flames, showcased in "[[Ashened to Endlessness]]"

  == Playing style ==
  "Ashened" is a DARK Pyro theme centered around the [[Field Spell]] card "[[Obsidim, the Ashened City]]" as well as the non-archetypal boss monster; "[[Veidos the Eruption Dragon of Extinction]]". All "Ashened" [[Main Deck]] monsters share the effect where if "Obsidim" is in the Field Zone, they can be [[Special Summon|Special Summoned]] from the hand. This allows for the monsters to swarm the board easily and go into various directions from [[Link Summon|Link]] to even some [[Xyz Summon|Xyz]] plays or occupy the board controlling the field by various means; such as the effect of "[[Hero of the Ashened City]]" to destroy Pyro monsters and place Obsidim back to the field should this effect destroy "Veidos".

  The typical play for "Ashened" involves getting Obsidim to the field and "Veidos" in hand through various means, such as the [[Spell Card]] "[[Awakening of Veidos]]", followed by using the effect of "Veidos" to destroy any card in the [[Field Zone]] and Summon itself to the opponent's field, destroying Obsidim to activate its effect to Special Summon any "Ashened" monster from the Deck as well as the effect of "Veidos" to add to hand or [[Set]] an "Ashened" [[Continuous Trap Card]] from your Deck. This can include the trap [[Ashened for Eternity]] to recycle a monster and steal another from the opponent's field or their newest trap card playing into [[Fusion Summon|Fusion Summoning]]. From here as well, players are able to recycle "Obsidim" through various means from the aforementioned effect of "Hero" to another effect of the Field Spell itself to return another copy of itself from the GY to the bottom of the Deck and draw 1 card.

  "Obsidim" comes with one final effect; the ability to make all face-up Special Summoned monsters the opponent controls become Pyro during the controller's turn. This plays well into recent support through cards such as the new [[Fusion Monster]] boss monsters; "[[Veidos the Dragon of Endless Darkness]]" and "[[Embers of the Ashened]]". Fusion "Veidos" having its [[Fusion Material]] require the Main Deck "Veidos" and 2+ [[Level]] 9 or lower Pyro monsters with the effects to destroy all Spells and Traps the opponent controls on Fusion Summon as well as destroy activated cards by sending an "Ashened" card to the GY. All the while, "Embers" required any 2 Pyro Monsters to make and on top of Field Spell recursion can automatically destroy an opponent's Pyro monster it battles and attack once more if activated during the player's turn. This allows the theme to run various powerful cards such as "[[Super Polymerization]]" as a means of disruption.
