  "'''Ashened'''" is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[Dark]] [[Pyro]] monsters which first debuted in ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  "Ashened" is defined as something or someone being devoid of color. The archetype is based on "[[wikipedia:Pompeii|Pompeii]]", an ancient city that was once located in what is now a region in [[wikipedia:Italy|Italy]] that was buried under [[wikipedia:Volcanic ash|Volcanic ash]] after the eruption of [[wikipedia:Mount Vesuvius|Mt. Vesuvius]] in 79 AD. It also loosely draws inspiration from the ''[[wikipedia:Dark Souls|Dark Souls]]'' franchise.
