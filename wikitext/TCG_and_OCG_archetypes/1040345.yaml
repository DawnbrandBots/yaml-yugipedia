  {{Quote|"[[Veidos the Eruption Dragon of Extinction]], a monster whose power can destroy the cycle of life and death itself. The defenders of [[Obsidim, the Ashened City|Obsidim]] could not save their homes from the might of Veidos, and were reduced to ash along with their city. The destructive power of Veidos was so great that their very souls were burned into the remains of the city itself. And now, they relive their struggle against Veidos for all eternity, keeping up the fight for so long that their names have been lost to the sands of time."|source=Yu-Gi-Oh!

  "'''Ashened'''" is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Pyro]] monsters which first debuted in ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  "Ashened" is defined as something or someone being devoid of color. The archetype is based on "[[wikipedia:Pompeii|Pompeii]]", an ancient city that was once located in what is now a region in [[wikipedia:Italy|Italy]] but was buried under [[wikipedia:Volcanic ash|Volcanic ash]] after the eruption of [[wikipedia:Mount Vesuvius|Mt. Vesuvius]] in 79 AD. It also seems to draw inspiration from the ''[[wikipedia:Dark Souls|Dark Souls]]'' franchise.
