  "'''Recipe'''" (レシピ ''Reshipi'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s that support both the "[[Nouvelles]]" archetype as a whole and the single monster "[[Hungry Burger]]".

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  In every language for nearly every card of this archetype, the card name contains a [[French]]-language phrase, followed by an approximate translation in the card's print language. The only exceptions are "[[Chef's Special Recipe]]" (not present in ''[[TCG]]'' printings) and "[[Hamburger Recipe]]" (not present in any printing), and this marks the only use of parentheses in ''[[TCG]]'' card names.

  The French-language print of these cards, for obvious reasons, doesn't require an extra translation, and doesn't share this particularity.
