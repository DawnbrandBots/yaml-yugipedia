  "'''Mimighoul'''" is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] monsters introduced in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Origin ===
  The name "Mimighoul" derives from the combination of the words "mimic" and "ghoul".

  A mimic is a fantasy creature popularized by tabletop game ''[[wikipedia:Dungeons & Dragons|Dungeons and Dragons]]'', characterized by its ability to take the form of mundane human objects in order to attract prey. Often but not always, the form taken is that of a treasure chest, and the prey is treasure-seeking adventurers; it has since become a staple of the fantasy genre. A ghoul, meanwhile, is a creature from Arabic folklore known for wandering through cemeteries and for their taste for human flesh.

  === Members ===
  Each of the [[Level]] 1 monsters of this archetype are based off a standard fantasy creatures found in fiction.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Mimighoul" playstyle is a control strategy focused around using the effects of its various [[Level]] 1 [[Flip monster]]s to [[Special Summon]] them to the opponent's side of the field [[Face-down|face-down]], which is used in tandem with the [[Field Spell Card]], "[[Mimighoul Dungeon]]" in order to prevent the opponent from [[Normal Summon|Normal Summoning]] while also preventing Special Summoned monsters from attacking as long as they control a face-down monster, forcing the opponent to flip the gifted "Mimighoul" monsters face-up. Upon being flipped face-up, each "Mimighoul" Flip Monster will proceed to activate, in sequence, their two effects; the first effect being a negative effect given to the controller of the monster, such as having their face-up monsters destroyed aside from "Mimighoul" monsters, being forced to [[Banish|banish]] the top 3 cards and give a banished monster to their opponent, or discarding a card from their hand and allowing the opponent to draw a card. After this negative effect resolves, the other effect triggers, returning control of the "Mimighoul" monster to the opponent where upon it will be granted a buff from "Mimighoul Dungeon", giving the monster ATK equal to their DEF.

  The theme is not solely reliant on the opponent Flip Summoning the gifted "Mimighoul" monsters however as there exist in-archetype ways to flip your opponents monsters up as means of disrupting their strategies. One of the primary means of this is the Boss Monster of the theme; "[[Mimighoul Master]]", a Level 4 monster capable of flipping an opponent's face-down monster into face-up [[Attack Position|Attack]] or [[Defense Position]]. Alongside that are two other cards in the strategy, "[[Mimighoul Maker]]" which is a [[Spell Card]] that reveals 2 Flip Monsters and randomly puts one of them on the opponent's field face-down and add the other to your hand before Special Summoning a "Mimighoul" monster from your hand, as well as "[[Mimighoul Room]]" which is a [[Trap Card]] that Special Summons a "Mimighoul" monster to your field from hand or Deck or to the opponent's field face-down.

  Due to the flexible nature of the theme, there are many unique ways to approach the theme when building it. For starters, due to the effect of "Mimighoul Maker", it is possible to run older Flip monsters to potentially give to the opponent and force them to be flipped during the opponents turn for a hindering effect; from Floodgate cards such as "[[Guard Dog]]" and "[[Sonic Jammer]]" to cards such as "[[Fire Sorcerer]]" that force the opponent to randomly banish 2 cards from their hand in order to burn you for 800 damage. The latter card in particular showing the basis of a more so niche direction one can take through the Spell "[[Summoning Curse]]", which when used in tandem with "Mimighoul" monsters would force the opponent to banish a card from their hand each time you Special Summon a "Mimighoul" to their side of the field and quickly reducing their hand to 0.

  Another popular direction to take the theme is through the use of the "[[Vernusylph]]" monsters, as all "Mimighoul" monsters are [[EARTH]] Attribute and therefore are able used as [[Discard]] fodder for the effects of the "Vernusylph" monster effects that also Special Summons them back to your side of the field to use their effects. There is also the practical use of cards from the "[[Ghostrick]]" archetype; namely "[[Ghostrick Night]]" to prevent the opponent from Flip Summoning while you control a "Ghostrick" monster, such as the [[Rank]] 1 "[[Ghostrick Dullahan]]" which can be used to Summon "[[Ghostrick Angel of Mischief]]" and add "Night" to your hand.
