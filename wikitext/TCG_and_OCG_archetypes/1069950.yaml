  "'''Mimighoul'''" is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] monsters introduced in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]''.

  ==Etymology==
  The name "Mimighoul" derives from the combination of the words "mimic" and "ghoul".

  ==Design==
  Design-wise, the Level 1 [[Flip monster]]s of the theme carry a similar formatting of colored treasure chests that, when opened, reveal a different kind of fantasy monster inside of it, likely to cause its effect to the one who opened it and then returning to its owner's control.

  ==Playing style==
  "Mimighoul" is a control strategy wherein the opponent is given a variety of [[Level]] 1 [[Flip monster]]s before being [[flip]]ped face-up on the opponent's field, triggering a series of negative effects onto the opponent from destroying their monsters except for "Mimighoul" monsters to banishing the top 3 cards of their deck to even discarding and making their opponent draw 1 card. After these negative effects resolve, the monsters then return to their owner's control.
