  "'''Mimighoul'''", spelled "'''Mimigul'''" (ミミグル ''Mimiguru'') in Japan,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://ygorganization.com/reference-art-mimighoul-archfiend/ | title = [Reference Art] Mimighoul Archfiend | author = Ness | website = The Organization | date = August 10, 2024 | accessdate = September 23, 2024}}</ref> is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] monsters introduced in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The name "Mimighoul" is a portmanteau of "mimic" and "ghoul".

  A [[wikipedia:Mimic (Dungeons & Dragons)|mimic]] is a fictional monster introduced and popularized by the tabletop game ''[[wikipedia:Dungeons & Dragons|Dungeons and Dragons]]''. Mimics are characterized by their ability to take the form of inanimate objects (e.g. treasure chests) in order to attract prey, such as treasure-seeking adventurers.

  A [[wikipedia:Ghoul|ghoul]] is a demon-like being from Arabic folklore known to dwell in cemeteries and other uninhabited places. They are known to scavenge human bodies and feast on their flesh.

  === Members ===
  The archetype's members are mainly [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 1 monsters (except for "[[Mimighoul Master]]") based on fantasy monsters found in popular culture. Additionally, apart from "Mimighoul Master", all of the archetype's Main Deck monsters are [[Flip monster]]s, which references how mimics disguise themselves as inanimate objects to ensnare any unsuspecting prey which interact with them.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Mimighoul" playstyle is a control strategy focused around using the effects of its various [[Level]] 1 [[Flip monster]]s to [[Special Summon]] them to the opponent's side of the field [[Face-down|face-down]], which is used in tandem with the [[Field Spell Card]], "[[Mimighoul Dungeon]]" in order to prevent the opponent from [[Normal Summon|Normal Summoning]] while also preventing their Special Summoned monsters from attacking the turn they were Summoned as long as they control a face-down monster, forcing the opponent to flip the gifted "Mimighoul" monsters face-up. Upon being flipped face-up, each "Mimighoul" Flip Monster will proceed to activate, in sequence, their two effects; the first effect being a negative effect given to the controller of the monster, such as having their face-up monsters destroyed aside from "Mimighoul" monsters, being forced to [[Banish|banish]] the top 3 cards and give a banished monster to their opponent, or losing a card from their hand and allowing the opponent to draw a card. After this negative effect resolves, the other effect triggers, returning control of the "Mimighoul" monster to the opponent where upon it will be granted a buff from "Mimighoul Dungeon", giving the monster ATK equal to their DEF. Because the Flip "Mimighoul" monsters force your opponent to activate monster effects, this makes the Normal Spells "[[Triple Tactics Talent]]" and "[[Triple Tactics Thrust]]" both exponentially more effective, as they can allow you to either search any Normal Spell/Trap, extend with a free +1, or gain full knowledge of and remove a card from your opponent's hand, even without them activating any of their own monster effects during your turn.

  The theme is not solely reliant on the opponent Flip Summoning the gifted "Mimighoul" monsters, however, as there exist in-archetype ways to flip your opponents monsters up as a means of disrupting their strategies. One of the primary means of this is the original boss monster of the theme; "[[Mimighoul Master]]", a Level 4 monster capable of flipping an opponent's face-down monster into face-up [[Attack Position|Attack]] or [[Defense Position]]. When paired with the Xyz Monster "[[Mimighoul Throne]]", it becomes a big stat stick with potential destruction protection and a Quick Effect bounce for up to 2 cards on your opponent's turn. The Deck's main boss monster, "[[Giant Mimighoul]]" (which is easily made with 2 Level 1s), not only gives extra consistency by searching any "Mimighoul" card, but in tandem with the previous cards and "Dungeon", can allow "Master" to attack directly for 4000 damage every turn, placing your opponent within range of losing to the Ignition Effect of "Giant": destroying face-up cards on the field up to the number of face-down monsters they control, and burning them for 1000 for each. Alongside that are two other cards in the strategy, "[[Mimighoul Maker]]" which is a [[Spell Card]] that reveals 2 Flip Monsters and randomly puts one of them on the opponent's field face-down and add the other to your hand before Special Summoning a "Mimighoul" monster from your hand, as well as "[[Mimighoul Room]]" which is a [[Trap Card]] that Special Summons a "Mimighoul" monster from your hand or Deck face-up to your field, or to the opponent's field face-down, then flipping 1 face-up monster face-down to possibly perpetuate the "Dungeon" lock.

  Due to the flexible nature of the theme, there are many unique ways to approach the theme when building it. For starters, due to the effect of "Mimighoul Maker", it is possible to run older Flip monsters to potentially give to the opponent and force them to be flipped during the opponent's turn for a hindering effect, such as "[[Fire Sorcerer]]", which forces the opponent to randomly banish 2 cards from their hand in order to burn you for 800 damage. The latter card in particular showing the basis of a more so niche direction one can take through the Spell "[[Summoning Curse]]", which when used in tandem with "Mimighoul" monsters would force the opponent to banish a card from their hand each time you Special Summon a "Mimighoul" to their side of the field and quickly reducing their hand to 0. When paired with other Flip support (like "[[Master of Ham]]"), "[[Mimighoul Master]]" can also be used to abuse powerful floodgate Flip monsters like "[[Guard Dog]]", or ones with extremely disruptive effects like "[[Morphing Jar]]".

  Another popular direction to take the theme is through the use of the "[[Vernusylph]]" monsters, as all "Mimighoul" monsters are [[EARTH]] Attribute and therefore are able used as [[Discard|discard]] fodder for the effects of the "Vernusylph" monster effects that also Special Summons them back to your side of the field to use their effects (although this will constrain the player to EARTH effects for the rest of this turn, which can prove somewhat limiting). There is also the practical use of cards from the "[[Ghostrick]]" archetype; namely "[[Ghostrick Night]]" to prevent the opponent from Flip Summoning while you control a "Ghostrick" monster, such as the [[Rank]] 1 "[[Ghostrick Dullahan]]", which can be used to Summon "[[Ghostrick Angel of Mischief]]" and add "Night" to your hand.
