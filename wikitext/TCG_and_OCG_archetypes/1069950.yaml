  "'''Mimighoul'''", spelled "'''Mimigul'''" (ミミグル ''Mimiguru'') in Japan,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://ygorganization.com/reference-art-mimighoul-archfiend/ | title = [Reference Art] Mimighoul Archfiend | author = Ness | website = The Organization | date = August 10, 2024 | accessdate = September 23, 2024}}</ref> is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] monsters introduced in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The name "Mimighoul" is a portmanteau of "mimic" and "ghoul".

  A [[wikipedia:Mimic (Dungeons & Dragons)|mimic]] is a fictional monster introduced and popularized by the tabletop game ''[[wikipedia:Dungeons & Dragons|Dungeons and Dragons]]''. Mimics are characterized by their ability to take the form of inanimate objects (e.g. treasure chests) in order to attract prey, such as treasure-seeking adventurers.

  A [[wikipedia:Ghoul|ghoul]] is a demon-like being from Arabic folklore known to dwell in cemeteries and other uninhabited places. They are known to scavenge human bodies and feast on their flesh.

  === Members ===
  The archetype's members are mainly [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 1 monsters (except for "[[Mimighoul Master]]") based on fantasy monsters found in popular culture. Additionally, apart from "Mimighoul Master", all of the archetype's Main Deck monsters are [[Flip monster]]s, which references how mimics disguise themselves as inanimate objects to ensnare any unsuspecting prey which interact with them.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Mimighoul" playstyle is a Control strategy focused around using the effects of its various [[Level]] 1 [[Flip monster]]s, which are Special Summoned to the opponent's field and have negative effects when flipped. This is combined with their [[Field Spell Card]], "[[Mimighoul Dungeon]]", which prevents the opponent from [[Normal Summon|Normal Summoning]], and delays their Special Summoned monsters from attacking, if they control a face-down monster.

  Each of the Flip monsters have the following effects:
  * FLIP: If it is the Main Phase: Apply the following effects (mandatory, in sequence):
  ** A negative effect applied to the controller, such as having their face-up monsters destroyed aside from "Mimighoul" monsters, being forced to [[Banish|banish]] the top 3 cards and give a banished monster to their opponent, or losing a card from their hand and allowing the opponent to draw a card.
  ** Give control of this card to the controller's opponent.
  * An effect in hand to Special Summon themselves face-down to the opponent's field. Some "Mimighoul" monsters also have an effect to Special Summon themselves (face-up) to your side of the field.

  The theme isn't solely reliant on the opponent Flip Summoning to activate flip effects. One of the primary means of this is the original boss monster of the theme, "[[Mimighoul Master]]", a Level 4 monster capable of flipping an opposing face-down monster. When paired with the Xyz Monster "[[Mimighoul Throne]]", it becomes a big stat stick with potential destruction protection and a Quick Effect bounce for up to 2 cards on your opponent's turn. The Deck's main boss monster, "[[Giant Mimighoul]]" (Rank 1) searches any "Mimighoul" card, allows non-Xyz "Mimighoul" monsters to attack directly, and can destroy opposing face-downs to deal 1000 damage per destroyed monster (which can be lethal after the direct attacks).

  Alongside that are two other cards in the strategy, "[[Mimighoul Maker]]" which is a [[Spell Card]] that reveals 2 Flip Monsters and randomly puts one of them on the opponent's field face-down and add the other to your hand before Special Summoning a "Mimighoul" monster from your hand, as well as "[[Mimighoul Room]]" which is a [[Trap Card]] that Special Summons a "Mimighoul" monster from your hand or Deck face-up to your field, or to the opponent's field face-down, then flipping 1 face-up monster face-down to possibly perpetuate the "Dungeon" lock.

  === External cards ===
  Due to the flexible nature of the theme, there are many unique ways to approach the theme when building it. Some useful external cards include:

  * "[[Triple Tactics Talent]]" and "[[Triple Tactics Thrust]]", which can meet their activation requirements through the "Mimighoul" monsters.
  * As "Mimighoul Maker" can Summon any Flip monster, it is possible to run older Flip monsters like "[[Fire Sorcerer]]" for their negative effects.
  * "[[Summoning Curse]]" can be used to force the opponent to banish a card from their hand each time you Special Summon a "Mimighoul" to their side of the field.
  * When paired with other Flip support (like "[[Master of Ham]]"), "[[Mimighoul Master]]" can be used to abuse powerful floodgate Flip monsters like "[[Guard Dog]]", or ones with extremely disruptive effects like "[[Morphing Jar]]".
  * Another popular direction to take the theme is through the use of the "[[Vernusylph]]" monsters, as all "Mimighoul" monsters are [[EARTH]] Attribute and therefore are able used as [[discard]] fodder for the effects of the "Vernusylph" monsters.
  * Certain cards from the "[[Ghostrick]]" archetype can be used; namely "[[Ghostrick Night]]" to prevent the opponent from Flip Summoning while you control a "Ghostrick" monster, such as the [[Rank]] 1 "[[Ghostrick Dullahan]]", which can be used to Summon "[[Ghostrick Angel of Mischief]]" and add "Night" to your hand.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * If you activate "[[Dominus Impulse]]", you cannot activate the effects of any gifted "Mimighoul" monsters (even though they are mandatory), shutting down the archetype's gimmick.
  * Certain board breakers, like "[[Forbidden Droplet]]" and "[[Dark Hole]]", can be used to clear your own field, breaking the "[[Mimighoul Dungeon]]" lock without needing to Flip Summon.
