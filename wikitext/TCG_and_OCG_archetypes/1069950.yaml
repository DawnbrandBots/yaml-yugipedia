  "'''Mimighoul'''" is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] monsters introduced in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Origin ===
  The name "Mimighoul" derives from the combination of the words "mimic" and "ghoul".

  A mimic is a fantasy creature popularized by tabletop game ''[[wikipedia:Dungeons & Dragons|Dungeons and Dragons]]'', characterized by its ability to take the form of mundane human objects in order to attract prey. Often but not always, the form taken is that of a treasure chest, and the prey is treasure-seeking adventurers. It has since become a staple of the fantasy genre. A ghoul, meanwhile, is a creature from Arabic folklore known for wandering through cemeteries and for their taste for human flesh.

  === Members ===
  Each of the [[Level]] 1 monsters of this archetype are based off a standard fantasy creatures found in fiction.

  == Playing style ==
  "Mimighoul" is a control strategy wherein the opponent is given a variety of [[Level]] 1 [[Flip monster]]s before being [[flip]]ped face-up on the opponent's field, triggering a series of negative effects onto the opponent from destroying their monsters except for "Mimighoul" monsters to banishing the top 3 cards of their deck to even discarding and making their opponent draw 1 card. After these negative effects resolve, the monsters then return to their owner's control.
