  "'''Fairy Tail'''" ({{Ruby|妖精伝姫|フェアリーテイル}} ''Fearī Teiru'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 4 [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with 1850 [[ATK]] and 1000 [[DEF]] that debuted in ''[[The Dark Illusion]]''. Initially a [[series]] of mostly independent monsters, they received their first direct support in ''[[Blazing Dominion]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  Each non-Fusion "Fairy Tail" monster is an anthropomorphic animals based on a female character from classic fairy tales. In addition, they each have a book (or a scroll in the case of "Luna", due to her eastern origins) on their tails, adorned by a big ribbon. Their artworks share a background adorned with a pattern in different colors for each card and bubbles.

  The "Fairy Tail" Fusion Monsters are human girls who seemingly write and tell the stories of the "Fairy Tails".

  === Etymology ===
  "Fairy Tail" is a play on "fairy tale" and "tail", referencing the fact that most of the members of this series are anthropomorphized animals with prominent tails.

  The kanji in the archetype's Japanese name 「妖精伝姫」 (''Yōseidenki'') mean "fairy tale princess". "Fairy tale" is translated literally, as in "princess of a tale of fairies"; the usual term for fairy tales in Japanese is 「おとぎ話」 (''otogibanashi'') instead. ''Denki'' is also homophonous with 「伝奇」, a loan of the Chinese term ''[[wikipedia:Chuanqi (short story and novella)|Chuanqi]]'' (lit. "strange tale")—used archaically for fantasy stories.

  The support introduced in ''[[Blazing Dominion]]'' heavily involves renaming the opponent's monster into the non-existent card "[[Fairy Prince]]". This references the common motif of several fairy tales that often has the "good prince" character to save the main female character from peril.

  Despite its English name, the card "[[Fairy Tail Tales]]" is not a member of the archetype, as its Japanese name is 「妖精<span style="color:red">の</span>伝姫」, with 「の」 interrupting the Japanese name. "[[Fairy Tail - Matchlille]]" specifically [[mention]]s "Fairy Tail Tales" in addition to "Fairy Tail" Spell/Trap Cards in order to allow it to search for either.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Fairy Tail" [[Main Deck]] monsters generally have effects that allow them to disrupt the opponent's plays, along with effects that help swarm the field and search relevant cards.

  *'''Rella:''' Prevents other monsters from being targeted by Spell Cards and equips itself with an Equip Spell Card from the hand, Deck, or Graveyard.
  *'''Luna:''' Returns an opponent's monster to the hand during either player's turn and searches another monster when Normal Summoned.
  *'''Sleeper:''' A Flip monster that Special Summons a monster from the player's hand and also allows them to change an opponent's Normal Spell/Trap effect.
  *'''Snow:''' Flips an opponent's monster face-down upon being Normal or Special Summoned and allows herself to be Special Summoned from the Graveyard during either player's turn.
  *'''Matchille:''' Can Special Summon herself while the player controls a Spellcaster monster with 1850 ATK, can search for a "Fairy Tail" Spell/Trap when Normal or Special Summoned, and can change the name of a monster on the field to "Fairy Prince" by paying 500 LP.

  Later support augments their strategy into a Fusion Summoning-focused strategy that revolves around using effects that repeatedly Special Summon Spellcasters with 1850 ATK to the field and disrupt the opponent's monsters by negating their effects and changing their names to "Fairy Prince". Opposing monsters whose names have been changed to "Fairy Prince" can then be used as Fusion Material via their Equip Spell Card, "[[Tales of Fairy Tail]]", clearing the board while building the user's own. Some support also offers the ability to Special Summon Spellcasters with 1850 ATK and "Fairy Tail" monsters from the banishment, alleviating a previous weakness for the monsters in their inability to recover themselves if banished.
