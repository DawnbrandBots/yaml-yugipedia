  '''Hex-Sealed Fusion''', known as  '''Fusion Seal Organism''' ({{Ruby|融|ゆう}}{{Ruby|合|ごう}}{{Ruby|呪|じゅ}}{{Ruby|印|いん}}{{Ruby|生|せい}}{{Ruby|物|ぶつ}} ''Yūgō Juin Seibutsu'') in the [[OCG]], is a series of [[Rock]] monsters with 1000 ATK and 1600 DEF focusing on Summoning a Fusion Monster of a specific attribute.

  == Mechanics ==
  The monsters in these series are [[Fusion Substitute Monster]]s that can be [[Tribute|Tributed]] with other [[Fusion Material]]s on the player's field to [[Special Summon]] 1 [[Fusion Monster]] of the same [[Attribute]] as the "Hex-Sealed Fusion" monster. The "Hex-Sealed Fusion" monster itself is counted as a one of the materials via substitution: e.g. if the player wants to Special Summon "[[Gatling Dragon]]" with "[[The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion]]", they must Tribute "The Dark" and ''either'' "[[Barrel Dragon]]" or "[[Blowback Dragon]]", not all three. Moreover, this is ''not'' treated as a [[Fusion Summon]], so if the Fusion Monster is subsequently sent to the [[Graveyard]] or [[banish]]ed, it will become unable to be Special Summoned back.
