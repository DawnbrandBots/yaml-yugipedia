  "'''Dueling Equipment'''", called "'''Battle Tool'''" ({{Ruby|闘|とう}}{{Ruby|器|き}} ''Tōki'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[Equip Spell Card|Equip Spell]] [[support]] cards for the "[[Gladiator Beast]]" archetype that were released in ''[[Gladiator's Assault]]''.

  Though the ''TCG'' texts of "[[Gladiator Beast Spartacus]]" state that it searches for a "Gladiator Beast" Equip Spell Card, the Japanese and Korean ones state that it searches for an Equip Spell Card with 「闘器」 in its name, thus making this a separate archetype. In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel]]'' video game, the English description for the ''[[Roar of the Gladiator Beasts]]'' [[Structure Deck]] uses the name "Dueling Equipment" where the Japanese one mentions the archetype's name.
