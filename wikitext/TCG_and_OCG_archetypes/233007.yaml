  "'''Beast's Battle'''", called "'''Battle Tool'''" ({{Ruby|闘|とう}}{{Ruby|器|き}} ''Tōki'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[Equip Spell Card|Equip Spell]] [[support]] cards for the "[[Gladiator Beast]]" archetype that were released in ''[[Gladiator's Assault]]''. Though the English lore of "[[Gladiator Beast Spartacus]]" states that it searches for a "''"Gladiator Beast" Equip Spell Card''", the Japanese lore states that it searches for an Equip Spell Card with 「闘器」 in its name, thus making this a separate archetype.
