  "'''Lightsworn'''", known as "'''Lightroad'''" (ライトロード ''Raitorōdo'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] monsters introduced in ''[[Light of Destruction]]''. It contains a sub-series of DARK monsters, "[[Twilightsworn]]", which banish "Lightsworn" monsters as the costs for their effects.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  Due to the words "Lord" and "Road" both transliterating to 「ロード」 (''Rōdo'') in Japanese, by itself the original name of this theme is ambiguous and can mean either "Lightlord" or "Lightroad".

  The ''TCG'' localization department considered "Lightlord" to be the intended meaning, as expressed by [[Kevin Tewart]] when he explained why the archetype was localized under the name "Lightsworn":
  {{quote|"Lord" is a male title, the female equivalent is "Lady". "Lightlord" would be a fine title if all of the monsters were male - which they are not. You would have to use "Lightlord" for the male monsters and "Lightlady" for the female ones. But what about [[Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter|Ryko]] and [[Gragonith, Lightsworn Dragon|Gragonith]], are they "Lightlord" or "Lightlady"? Perhaps we'd need a 3rd category, called "Lighthing". Or perhaps "Lightit". Also you'd need to change things like [[Judgment Dragon]] to work off of "Lightlord and/or Lightlady". Or even "Lightlord / Lightlady / Lightit monsters".

  Names like "Lightlord" work fine in Japan, where people think English is cool even though they can't understand it. These same names don't work so well in places where people actually know what the words mean.<ref name="pojo">{{cite web |last1=Tewart |first1=Kevin |title=Why were they changed? |url=https://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?p=21673923 |website=Pojo.com forums |access-date=11 April 2024 |page=2 |date=2011-05-12}}</ref>}}

  In contrast, the [[Traditional Chinese]] release of ''[[Structure Deck: Dragonic Legion]]'' in 2015 uses the name 「光道」 (''Guāngdào''), meaning "Lightroad", which was maintained by later [[Simplified Chinese]] prints. "[[Lightsworn Dragonling]]", released in 2024, has its Japanese name was written as 「{{Name|Lightsworn Dragonling|ja}}」, using the same Kanji characters for "Lightsworn" as the Chinese names, implying that "Lightroad" is an intended meaning of the name. It is unclear whether the name is a pun on both meanings, or if it was always intended to only mean "Lightroad".

  === Story ===
  {{Main|Master Duel card storylines#Enforcers of Justice}}
  The "Lightsworns" are a group who seek to save those who pray for help, crossing time and space in order to help them. By consuming vast quantities of magical energy, they appear on the material plane and challenge those evildoers who threaten the era they appear in. Once their job is done and the evil has been stopped, they return to their home plane, disappearing without a trace.

  Their founder, "[[Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn]]", is responsible for enlisting the souls of heroes worthy of joining the "Lightsworns". As they travel in order to fight evil, they also recruit the heroes of that time.<ref>[http://www.ygorganization.com/geargia-lightsworn-lore/ YGOrganization] - [OCG] Lore on the Geargias and Lightsworn!</ref>

  == Playing style ==
  Lightsworn is an archetype focused on milling from the Deck for benefits. Many (but not all) of the original "Lightsworns" mill in the End Phase, the "Twilightsworns" mill when a "Lightsworn" monster effect is activated, and more recent cards have some other easy to activate mill condition. Another common theme is to perform a lethal push using "[[Judgment Dragon]]", and the related cards "[[Punishment Dragon]]" and "[[Enlightenment Dragon]]".

  While [[Deck out]] can be a concern, especially in the past, more recent cards like "Punishment Dragon", "[[Lightsworn Judgment]]", and the "[[Ishizu (series)|Ishizu]]" shufflers can help avoid it.

  === Historical Variants ===
  "Lightsworn" has gone through many variants throughout the game's history, as their ability to mill is useful in many Decks, and the archetype itself has received multiple waves of support. Also, more good mill targets like "[[Fairy Tail - Snow]]" were released over time. <!---Ideally add more variants here, this is barebones --->

  * When first introduced, the Deck could be played pure, or run as a small engine consisting of "[[Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter]]" and "[[Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner]]" to get mills in other Decks. They were hit by the [[March 2010 Lists]], though continued to remain relevant.

  * The archetype could also be combined with "[[Chaos]]" monsters, as "Lightsworns" comprised of some of the best LIGHT monsters of the time. In ~2011, a build known as "[[Twilight]]" (not to be confused with the actual "[[Twilightsworn]]" monsters) used the "Lightsworns" with DARKs and Chaos monsters, including the then-recently unbanned "[[Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning]]" and "[[Chaos Sorcerer]]".

  * Cards released in the ''[[Realm of Light Structure Deck]]'' gave the Deck access to Synchros and [[Tuner]]s.

  * In 2017-2018, with the release of "[[That Grass Looks Greener]]", "Lightsworn" could be used as an engine within Decks using "Grass".

  * With the most recent support in ''[[Legacy of Destruction]]'' (2024), it has seen some play with other mill/GY archetypes, such as "[[Tearlaments]]" and "[[Horus]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As a LIGHT Deck, it is hurt by anti LIGHT cards like "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]" and the "[[Bystial]]s".
  * Anti-GY floodgates: Cards like "[[Dimension Shifter]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]", and "[[Dimension Fortress Weapon]]" prevent cards from reaching the GY, shutting down the Deck.
  * In earlier formats, the Deck could be weak to stalling, as it was prone to decking out. The destructive effects of cards like "[[Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter|Ryko]]", "[[Lumina, Lightsworn Summoner|Lumia]]", and "[[Judgement Dragon]]" made stalling difficult, but it was possible.

  == Trivia ==
  * "[[Jenis, Lightsworn Mender]]", "[[Wulf, Lightsworn Beast]]", and "[[Rinyan, Lightsworn Rogue]]" are the only "Lightsworn" monsters that do not [[mill]].
  * All "Lightsworn" monsters' artworks have a square with one or more halos (usually appearing behind their head) in their background.
  * [[Master Guide 3 card storylines|Master Guide 3]] describes the self-milling effects of "Lightsworn" monsters during the End Phase as "requiring immense amounts of magic to stay in other worlds while maintaining their minds and bodies".
