  {{Quote|The archetype's tagline in promotional material|Hidden feelings secretly gather up...}}
  "'''Rikka'''", known as "'''Snowflower'''" ({{Ruby|六|りっ}}{{Ruby|花|か}} ''Rikka'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Plant]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] which debuted in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Secret Slayers]]''.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|Master Duel card storylines#The Rikka Fairies Descend}}

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  The Japanese name for this archetype, 「{{Ruby|六|りっ}}{{Ruby|花|か}}」''Rikka'', is a poetic word meaning "snow". The word itself is composed of the Kanji for "six" and "flower", alluding to the usual hexagonal shape of a snowflake, which can resemble a six-petal flower.

  ===Appearance===
  The members have appearance and fashion style that are unique among different levels. The Level 4 monsters appear to be young girls wearing skater dress. The Level/Rank 6 monsters are teenage girls wearing Eastern-Asian traditional clothing. The Level/Rank 8 monsters appear to be adult women in Victorian fashion.
  All members wield a crystalline umbrella styled after a snowflake. All Xyz monsters have their own individual umbrella designs, while the paired Main Deck monsters with the same level, as well as the "Petal" and "Snow Princess" pair, each share one umbrella design between the pair.

  ===Members===
  Except "Petal" and "Snow Princess", Main Deck "Rikka" monsters ("Rikka Fairy") are named after cold-resistant flowering plants that originate from Europe and/or Africa. They are organized in pairs of even Levels; the pairs' members have mirrored ATK and DEF compared to each other, and the one with higher ATK faces to the viewer's left while the one with higher DEF faces to the viewer's right. The Xyz Monsters ("Rikka Queen") are named after types of floral ornaments, have equal ATK and DEF, and physically resemble both members with the same Level as their respective Rank.

  ==Playing style==
  "Rikka" is an archetype focusing on [[Xyz Summon]]ing and [[Tribute|Tributing]] monsters, either as cost, effect, or as a condition for [[Trigger Effect]]s. The Deck is also focused on supporting the [[Plant]] typing, and several of its key cards lock the player out of Special Summoning non-Plant monsters.

  Each Main Deck "Rikka" monster has two effects, generally revolving around Special Summoning themselves from the hand or GY and level manipulation. The high-ATK Main Deck "Rikka" monsters each have a [[hand trap]]-like effect activated by Tributing themselves from the player's [[hand]] or [[field]], and a second effect to Special Summon themselves from the player's GY (but they will then banish themselves when they leave the field).

  The low-ATK Main Deck "Rikka" monsters each have an effect to Special Summon themselves from the player's [[hand]], and a second effect activated on the field.

  |}

  Within the above monsters, the two key monsters are "Mudan", who is a Spell/Trap searcher, and "Snowdrop", who can Special Summon multiple monsters from hand, and can rapidly modulate levels for Xyz Summoning.

  "[[Rikka Petal]]" and "[[Rikka Snow Princess]]" deviate from the effect patterns of the other "Rikka" Main Deck monsters. "Petal" is the deck's starter, able to search any "Rikka" monster by adding them to hand or sending them to GY, but locking the player into only Special Summoning plants in the process. It is also the Deck's main resoure recursion point, as it can Special Summon itself from GY (at no cost) in the opponent's End Phase. "Snow Princess" is a free plant Special Summon extender, and also a conditional monster effect negate in the hand/GY.
  "Rikka" Xyz monsters have varied effects further revolving around Tributing.
  * The Rank 4 "[[Rikka Queen Strenna|Strenna]]" can recover GY resources and Special Summon 1 high-Rank Plant Xyz monster from the Extra Deck if Tributed, making it both a "costless" Tribute target and a board builder.
  * The Rank 6 "[[Kanzashi the Rikka Queen|Kanzashi]]" has situational protective and revival effects.
  * The Rank 8 "[[Teardrop the Rikka Queen|Teardrop]]" (easily made with "Snowdrop") has a monster Tribute effect that conditionally becomes a [[Quick Effect]], making for an excellent non-destruction removal disruption.

  "Rikka" Spell/Traps back up the archetype's strategy by providing further searching, disruption, and recursion. For Spells, "[[Rikka Glamour|Glamour]]" is a monster searcher, the Continuous Spell "[[Rikka Flurries|Flurries]]" has a situational "[[Share the Pain]]"-like effect, and the Field Spell "[[Rikka Konkon|Konkon]]" searches Spell/Traps, and also lets the player tribute opposing monsters for the costs of "Rikka" cards. For Traps, "[[Rikka Tranquility|Tranquility]]" is a monster revival trap, and "[[Rikka Sheet]]" is a monster effect lockdown trap.
  Additionally, three "Rikka" Spell/Traps feature an optional [[cost]] of Tributing a Plant monster at activation to provide an extra effect at resolution: "[[Rikka Glamour|Glamour]]" will search 2 cards instead of 1, "[[Rikka Sheet|Sheet]]" will take control of the target in addition to locking down its effects, and "[[Rikka Tranquility|Tranquility]]" will Special Summon 2 monsters instead of 1.

  As a whole, the deck is broadly mid-range, focusing on medium-impact turn 1 boards with strong recursion in later turns. The Deck's main in-archetype board presence include "[[Teardrop the Rikka Queen]]", "[[Rikka Sheet]]", "[[Rikka Snow Princess]]" in the GY, and a boss monster summoned by tributing "[[Rikka Queen Strenna]]" (usually "[[Sacred Tree Beast, Hyperyton]]"). The Deck's main recursion points are the GY recovery effect of "[[Rikka Queen Strenna]]", the self-revival effect of "[[Rikka Petal]]", the S/T searching effect of the Field Spell "[[Rikka Konkon]]", and the revival of "[[Rikka Tranquility]]".

  ===Rikka Sunavalon===
  "Rikka" decks has a great synergy with the "[[Sunavalon]]" archetype, as the latter provides a great degree of resource recovery and allows an access to various Plant link monsters. The deck has multiple ways of accessing "[[Sunseed Genius Loci]]", which is capable of set up plays all by itself.
