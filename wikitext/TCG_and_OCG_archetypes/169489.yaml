  "'''Photon'''" (フォトン ''Foton'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Kite Tenjo]], [[Dextra]] and [[Nistro]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'', and created by [[Dr. Faker]] and [[Mr. Heartland]] together. [[Yusaku Fujiki]] also uses "[[Photon Thrasher (later anime)|Photon Thrasher]]" in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]''. This archetype was first released in ''[[Photon Shockwave]]''. Most of the monsters in this archetype have armored or scaly bodies that emit blue light. The "Photon" archetype is intimately related to the "[[Galaxy]]" archetype.
  In the anime, Kite's Deck was created by using science from another dimension,<ref name="ep13">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|13|ref}}</ref> later revealed to be [[Barian World]],<ref name="ep70">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|70|ref}}</ref> though [[Astral]] compared the energy of "[[Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon (anime)|Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon]]" to that of his [[Astral World|own world]].<ref name="ep25">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|25|ref}}</ref>
  In physics, a [[wikipedia:Photon|photon]] is an elementary particle, the quantum of light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force.

  == Playing style ==
  The goal of a "Photon" Deck is to take [[control]] of the [[field]]. The archetype features a fantastic variety of [[Swarm]] cards, including "[[Accellight]]", "[[Photon Lead]]", "[[Twin Photon Lizard]]" and "[[Paladin of Photon Dragon]]"– a [[Ritual Monster]] that can be summoned twice with the same [[Ritual Spell Card]]. Besides this, many "Photon" cards focus on Summoning their ace monster, "[[Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon]]", which is a good example of "Photon" field control: its [[banish|self-banishing]] [[Quick Effect]] allows it to evade [[Trap Card|Traps]] like "[[Dimensional Prison]]" and bypass other card effects. Another example is "[[Photon Leo]]", which can [[shuffle]] cards in your opponent's [[hand]] back into the Deck. This can be a very disruptive effect in numerous situations. Lower-[[Level]] "Photon" monsters have more strategic uses, such as adding different "Photon" [[Monster Card]]s to your hand or even multiplying themselves. This can also go hand-in-hand with "Galaxy" cards, though the searching effects of both via "[[Photon Lizard]]" and "[[Galaxy Wizard]]".
  All "Photon" monsters are [[LIGHT]] and as such receive benefits from LIGHT [[support]] cards such as "[[Honest]]".
  "Photon" monsters are unique in that they often have effects that play with the [[Rule of 2000]] – many of the archetype's low-level monsters feature 2000+ [[ATK]] to make them viable sacrifices for "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon", while also augmenting their abilities as beaters. However, because of their incongruously high ATK, low-Level Photons often come with restriction effects to balance out their power. For example, the effect of "[[Photon Crusher]]" is mimics early beatdown favorite "[[Goblin Attack Force]]", forcing it into [[Defense Position]] after every attack (its DEF is 0), while "[[Photon Thrasher]]" is a [[Special Summon-only monster]] that can only attack if it is alone on the field. The ''TCG''/''OCG'' original Level 3 "[[Photon Sabre Tiger]]" loses 800 ATK if it's the only copy of itself on your side of the field, but sports 2000-point [[Original ATK|Original ATK score]] if more than one exists.
  "Photon" monsters are generally difficult to defeat in battle (most notably "Galaxy-Eyes", which can never lose at one-on-one combat due to its effect, if not interrupted). However, the archetype focus most of its effort towards offensive plays, and lacks defensive capacity– featuring little to no protection against hostile card effects.
