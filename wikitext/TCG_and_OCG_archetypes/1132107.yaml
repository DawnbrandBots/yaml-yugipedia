  "'''R.B.'''", short for "'''Revol Bots'''"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh6SKhci778&t=4253s | title = Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG {{!}} Duelist's Advance {{!}} Set Introduction | publisher = Official Yu-Gi-Oh! TRADING CARD GAME Channel (YouTube) | date = June 16, 2025 | accessdate = June 16, 2025}}</ref>, is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[Machine]] monsters introduced in ''[[Duelist's Advance]]''.

  ==Playing style==
  "R.B." is centralized around Summoning "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]", then having it point to other members of the archetype.

  * Each "R.B." Main Deck monster can Special Summon itself if the player controls no face-up monsters other than "R.B." monsters. They all have an effect that can only be activated if [[linked]] to an "R.B." Link Monster. These effects require an LP [[cost]], and destroy the monster (as effect), for some sort of benefit.

  Because the Links can use any Machine as material, the archetype can synergize with various other Machine engines/archetypes, such as "[[Speedroid Terrortop]]" + "[[Speedroid Taketomborg|Taketomborg]]", "[[Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones]]", "[[Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi]]", and "[[Machina]]" (with "[[Machina Citadel]]" able to trigger itself off the EARTH Machine "R.B." monsters).

  === Sample combos ===
  '''R.B. Stage Landing'''

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = [[R.B. Stage Landing]]
  | end     = "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" pointing to "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]," "[[R.B. Ga10 Driller]]," and "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]" + "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]" in the Field Zone
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[R.B. Stage Landing]]," summoning "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" to the Extra Monster Zone
  # Use the effect of "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]," adding "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]" from deck to hand.
  # Special Summon "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]" to a zone "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" points to. (Note: If your opponent activated [[Droll & Lock Bird]] upon resolution of the effect of "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" or had activated "[[Mulcharmy Fuwalos]]" in response to "[[R.B. Stage Landing]]," you can end the combo here and still retain a Spell or Trap negation.)
  # Link Summon "[[Clockwork Knight]]" using "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]" as material.
  # Use the effect of "[[Clockwork Knight]]," tributing "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" and Special Summoning "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]."
  # Link Summon "[[Ancient Gear Ballista]]" using "[[Clockwork Knight]]" and "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]" as material.
  # Use the effect of "[[Ancient Gear Ballista]]," searching "[[Ancient Gear Box]]."
  # Use the effect of "[[Ancient Gear Box]]," searching "[[R.B. Ga10 Driller]]."
  # Normal Summon "[[Ancient Gear Box]]."
  # Link Summon "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]" using "[[Ancient Gear Box]]" and "[[Ancient Gear Ballista]]" as material.
  # Activate the first effect of "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]," searching "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]."
  # Activate "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]," searching another copy of "[[R.B. Stage Landing]]."
  # Activate the second effect of "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]," placing itself in a zone directly beneath one of the Extra Monster Zones and Special Summoning the "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]" in your Graveyard to a zone adjacent to the new placement of "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]."
  # Activate the new copy of "[[R.B. Stage Landing]]," summoning a new copy of "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" to the zone directly above "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]."
  # Special Summon "[[R.B. Ga10 Driller]]" to the other zone adjacent to "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]."
  }}

  '''[[Rescue-ACE Air Lifter]]'''

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = [[Rescue-ACE Air Lifter]]
  | end     = "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" pointing to any 2 "R.B." Main Deck monsters + "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]" + [[Rescue-ACE Turbulence]] + [[Rescue-ACE Hydrant]] + [[RESCUE!]] + [[CONTAIN!]] + [[EXTINGUISH!]]
  | steps   = 
  # Normal Summon Lifter and use its effect to search [[EMERGENCY!]].
  # EMERGENCY! summon Hydrant tribute Lifter
  # Hydrant search Turbulence
  # Turbulence banish Lifter + EMERGENCY! to summon itself
  # Turbulence set [[ALERT!]], RESCUE!, CONTAIN!, and EXTINGUISH!
  # Hydrant allows you to activate ALERT! the turn it was set to search [[Rescue-ACE Preventer]]
  # Hydrant + Turbulence = [[R.B. VALCan Booster]], then use its effect to search [[R.B. Funk Dock]]
  # Funk Dock search an R.B. Main Deck monster, then use its effect to summon itself. 
  # R.B. = [[Clockwork Knight]]
  # Preventer banish Turbulence summon itself
  # Knight tribute Preventer summon Hydrant
  # Preventer summon the banished Turbulence
  # Booster summon the R.B. from GY and move itself. 
  # Booster + Knight = [[R.B. The Brute Blues]]
  # Brute search [[R.B. Stage Landing]]
  # Landing summon a second R.B. Main Deck monster
  }}

  While the archetype has an Extra Deck affecting lock as a result of "Stage Landing" and "VALCan Booster", certain combos can avoid the lock through external methods:

  '''Any 2 Machines'''

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = Any 2 Machine monsters
  | end     = "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" pointing to any 1 "R.B." Main Deck monster + "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]" in the Field Zone
  | steps   = 
  # Link Summon "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]", use its effect to search "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]".
  # Activate "Funk Dock", use its effect to search a "R.B." monster (which won't remain on field).
  # Special Summon the searched "R.B." monster.
  # Link Summon "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" using "VALCan Booster" and the leftover monster.
  # Use the effect of "Brute Blues" to search a different "R.B." monster.
  # Special Summon the other searched "R.B." monster.

  If the Extra Deck lock of "VALCan Booster" can be afforded, the above combo can be adjusted to keep an extra "R.B" monster on field:
  # At Step 3, with "VALcan Booster" and an "R.B." monster are on field, Link Summon "[[Clockwork Knight]]" using the searched "R.B." monster.
  # Use "VALCan Booster's" second effect to Special Summon the "R.B." monster used as material.
  # Link Summon "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" using "VALCan Booster" and "Knight". Continue at Step 5.
  }}

  '''Machina Redeployment'''

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Machina Redeployment]]" + 1 card in hand
  | end     = "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" pointing to "[[R.B. Ga10 Driller]]" and "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]", with "[[Machina Citadel]]" in GY, "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]" in the Field Zone and 2 cards drawn
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[Machina Redeployment]]", discard 1 card and add "[[Machina Gearframe]]" and "[[Machina Unclaspare]]"
  # "Unclaspare" effect to summon itself, send "[[Machina Fortress]]" to GY
  # Summon "Gearframe", add "[[Machina Citadel]]" to hand.
  # Overlay "Gearframe" and "Unclaspare" for "[[Gear Gigant X]]"
  # Effect of "Gear Gigant X" to search for either "[[R.B. Ga10 Driller]]" or "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]"
  # Overlay for "[[Drill Driver Vespenato]]" using "Gear Gigant"
  # Summon "Fortress" using "Citadel" as cost
  # Link Summon "[[Ancient Gear Ballista]]" using "Vespenato" and "Fortress"
  # Effect of "Ballista" to add "[[Ancient Gear Box]]", whose effect adds "[[Infinitrack Tunneller]]"
  # Summon "Fortress" using "Box" and "Tunneller" as cost
  # Link Summon "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" using "Ballista" and "Fortress"
  # Effect of "Brute Blues" to add either "Ga10 Driller" or "Ga10 Cutter" (or "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]", and then one of the aforementioned cards)
  # Summon "Ga10 Driller" and "Ga10 Cutter" to zones that "Brute Blues" points to
  # Draw 2 cards by using "Tunneller" to shuffle "Gear Gigant", "Vespenato", "Ballista", "Gearframe" and "Box" back into Deck

  }}

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Non-destruction removal, such as "[[S:P Little Knight]]" and "[[Ultimate Slayer]]", can be effective when used on the archetype's Link monsters, as the Main Deck monsters cannot activate their effects without an "R.B." Link pointing to them.
  ** Like all Machine archetypes, "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" and "[[System Down]]" are especially effective at breaking their boards.
  * Anti-search cards, like "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]", are effective due to the Field Spell and both Links having a search effect.
