  ==Playing style==
  "R.B." is centralized around 'gearing up' the archetype's Link Monsters, by having them point to other members of the archetype. 

  Every Main Deck monster has an effect which cost LP, can only be activated if the monster is [[linked]] to an "R.B." Link Monster, and destroys itself on resolution, but disrupts the opponent in some way. In addition, many of them can Special Summon themselves if the player controls no face-up monsters other than "R.B." monsters.

  As for the Link monsters:
  * "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]" can search an archetypal Spell, and Summon an "R.B." from hand or GY.
  * "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" can search any archetypal card, and gains ATK and some protective effects when pointing to an "R.B" monster.
  * "[[R.B. Shepherd's Crook]]" can search an archetypal Trap by Setting it on field, and on the opponent's turn, revive an "R.B." Monster with a Level

  The Links can use any Machine as material, allowing the archetype to synergize with various other Machine engines/archetypes. Some examples include "[[Speedroid Terrortop]]", ""[[Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones]]", "[[Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi]]", and "[[Machina]]" (with "[[Machina Citadel]]" able to trigger itself off the EARTH Machine "R.B." monsters).

  The archetype can also be used to make a generic Rank 3-5 Xyz Monster without locks, due to the effects of "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]" and "[[Clockwork Knight]]". This can be used to search members of other archetypes, e.g., "[[Gear Gigant X]]" to search a Machine, or "[[K9-17 "Ripper"]]" to search a "[[K9]]" card.

  === Sample combos ===
  ;R.B. Stage Landing

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[R.B. Stage Landing]]"
  | end     = "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" pointing to "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]," "[[R.B. Ga10 Driller]]," and "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]" + "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]" in the Field Zone
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[R.B. Stage Landing]]," summoning "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" to the Extra Monster Zone
  # Use the effect of "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]," adding "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]" from deck to hand.
  # Special Summon "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]" to a zone "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" points to. (Note: If your opponent activated [[Droll & Lock Bird]] upon resolution of the effect of "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" or had activated "[[Mulcharmy Fuwalos]]" in response to "[[R.B. Stage Landing]]," you can end the combo here and still retain a Spell or Trap negation.)
  # Link Summon "[[Clockwork Knight]]" using "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]" as material.
  # Use the effect of "[[Clockwork Knight]]," tributing "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" and Special Summoning "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]."
  # Link Summon "[[Ancient Gear Ballista]]" using "[[Clockwork Knight]]" and "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]" as material.
  # Use the effect of "[[Ancient Gear Ballista]]," searching "[[Ancient Gear Box]]."
  # Use the effect of "[[Ancient Gear Box]]," searching "[[R.B. Ga10 Driller]]."
  # Normal Summon "[[Ancient Gear Box]]."
  # Link Summon "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]" using "[[Ancient Gear Box]]" and "[[Ancient Gear Ballista]]" as material.
  # Activate the first effect of "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]," searching "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]."
  # Activate "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]," searching another copy of "[[R.B. Stage Landing]]."
  # Activate the second effect of "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]," placing itself in a zone directly beneath one of the Extra Monster Zones and Special Summoning the "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]" in your Graveyard to a zone adjacent to the new placement of "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]."
  # Activate the new copy of "[[R.B. Stage Landing]]," summoning a new copy of "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" to the zone directly above "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]."
  # Special Summon "[[R.B. Ga10 Driller]]" to the other zone adjacent to "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]."
  }}

  ;R.B. Funk Dock

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]" + 1 card in hand
  | end     = "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" in the Extra Monster Zone pointing to "[[R.B. Shepherd's Crook]]" and "R.B. Lambda Blade", "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]" in the Field Zone, "[[R.B. Next Phase]]" set, and "[[Machina Citadel]]" in Graveyard.
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]", add "[[R.B. Stage Landing]]" to hand.
  # Activate "Stage Landing", summon "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]", add another "Stage Landing"
  # Activate "Stage Landing", summon "[[R.B. Lambda Cannon]]
  # Effect of "Lambda Cannon" to remove summon and negate a monster from the opponent's hand.
  # Trigger "Funk Dock" off "Lambda Cannon" destruction, summon "[[R.B. Lambda Blade]]"
  # Effect of "Lambda Blade" to send "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]" to Graveyard
  # Link "The Brute Blues" and "Lambda Blade" into "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]"
  # "VALCan Booster" add "[[R.B. Operation Test]]"
  # "Operation Test" summons "Lambda Cannon", "Lambda Cannon" adds "Ga10 Cutter" to hand
  # Summon "Ga10 Cutter"
  # Use "VALCan Booster" to summon "Lambda Blade" and move itself to another zone
  # "Operation Test" returns "Lambda Blade" to hand and then re-summons it
  # Link "Ga10 Cutter" into "[[Clockwork Knight]]"
  # "Clockwork Knight" send "Operation Test" for "[[Clockwork Night]]"
  # Link "Clockwork Knight" and "Lambda Cannon" into "[[Barricadeborg Blocker]]"
  # "Barricadeborg" pitch "Clockwork Night"
  # "Clockwork Night" effect in Graveyard, discarding a card to search for "[[Machina Gearframe]]"
  # Summon "Gearframe", add "[[Machina Unclaspare]]"
  # "Unclaspare" effect to send "[[Machina Citadel]]" to Graveyard
  # Link "Barricadeborg" and a "Machina" into "The Brute Blues" in the Extra Monster Zone
  # Link "VALCan Booster" and a "Machina" into "[[R.B. Shepherd's Crook]]" in the Main Monster Zone
  # "Shepherd's Crook" effect to set "[[R.B. Next Phase]]"
  }}

  While the archetype has an Extra Deck-affecting lock as a result of "Stage Landing" and "VALCan Booster", certain combos can avoid the lock through external methods:

  ;2 Monsters

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = 2 Effect Monsters
  | end     = 2 Machine Monsters (see next combo)
  | steps   = 
  # Link Summon [[Sky Striker Ace - Camellia]] and use its effect to send [[Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones]]
  # Link Camellia into [[Sky Striker Ace - Kagari]] and use its effect to recycle the Hornet Drones
  # Activate Hornet Drones to summon a [[Sky Striker Ace Token]]
  # Link Kagari into any Link-1 Sky Striker with a downwards pointing arrow (Amatsu, Hayate, or Kaina)
  # Link the token into another Link-1 Sky Striker
  # Proceed from here with the "2 Machine Monsters" combo
  }}

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = 2 Machine Monsters
  | end     = "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" pointing to any 1 "R.B." Main Deck monster + "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]" in the Field Zone
  | steps   = 
  # Link Summon "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]", use its effect to search "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]".
  # Activate "Funk Dock", use its effect to search a "R.B." monster (which won't remain on field).
  # Special Summon the searched "R.B." monster.
  # Link Summon "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" using "VALCan Booster" and the leftover monster.
  # Use the effect of "Brute Blues" to search a different "R.B." monster.
  # Special Summon the other searched "R.B." monster.

  If the Extra Deck lock of "VALCan Booster" can be afforded, the above combo can be adjusted to keep an extra "R.B" monster on field:
  # At Step 3, with "VALcan Booster" and an "R.B." monster are on field, Link Summon "[[Clockwork Knight]]" using the searched "R.B." monster.
  # Use "VALCan Booster's" second effect to Special Summon the "R.B." monster used as material.
  # Link Summon "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" using "VALCan Booster" and "Knight". Continue at Step 5.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Non-destruction removal, such as "[[S:P Little Knight]]" and "[[Ultimate Slayer]]", can be effective when used on the archetype's Link monsters, as the Main Deck monsters cannot activate their effects without an "R.B." Link pointing to them.
  ** Like all Machine archetypes, "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" and "[[System Down]]" are especially effective at breaking their boards.
  * Anti-search cards, like "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]", are effective due to the Field Spell and two of the Links having a search effect.
  * The archetype has many board breaking effects, though most either target or destroy. Therefore, monsters that are immune to both, such as "[[Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon]]", can be hard to deal with.
