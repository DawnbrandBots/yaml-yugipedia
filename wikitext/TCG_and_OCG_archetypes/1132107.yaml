  "'''R.B.'''", short for "'''Revol Bots'''"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh6SKhci778&t=4253s | title = Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG {{!}} Duelist's Advance {{!}} Set Introduction | publisher = Official Yu-Gi-Oh! TRADING CARD GAME Channel (YouTube) | date = June 16, 2025 | accessdate = June 16, 2025}}</ref>, is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[Machine]] monsters introduced in ''[[Duelist's Advance]]''.

  ==Playing style==
  "R.B." is centralized around Summoning "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]", then having it point to other members of the archetype.

  * Each "R.B." Main Deck monster can Special Summon itself if the player controls no monsters other than "R.B." monsters. They all have an effect that can only be activated if [[linked]] to an "R.B." Link Monster. These effects require an LP [[cost]], and destroy the monster (as effect), for some sort of benefit.

  Because the Links can use any Machine as material, the archetype can synergize with various other Machine engines/archetypes, such as "[[Speedroid Terrortop]]" + "[[Speedroid Taketomborg|Taketomborg]]", "[[Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones]]", and "[[Machina]]" (with "[[Machina Citadel]]" able to trigger itself off the EARTH Machine "R.B." monsters). While the archetype has an Extra Deck lock, certain combos can avoid the lock.

  === Sample combos ===
  '''Lockless combo off any 2 Machines'''

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = Any 2 Machine monsters
  | end     = "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" pointing to any 1 "R.B." Main Deck monster + "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]" in the Field Zone
  | steps   = 
  # Link Summon "[[R.B. VALCan Booster]]", use its effect to search "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]".
  # Activate "Funk Dock", use its effect to search a "R.B." monster (which won't remain on field).
  # Special Summon the searched "R.B." monster.
  # Link Summon "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" using "VALCan Booster" and the leftover monster.
  # Use the effect of "Brute Blues" to search a different "R.B." monster.
  # Special Summon the other searched "R.B." monster.

  If the Extra Deck lock of "VALCan Booster" can be afforded, the above combo can be adjusted to keep an extra "R.B" monster on field:
  # At Step 3, with "VALcan Booster" and an "R.B." monster are on field, Link Summon "[[Clockwork Knight]]" using the searched "R.B." monster.
  # Use "VALCan Booster's" second effect to Special Summon the "R.B." monster used as material.
  # Link Summon "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" using "VALCan Booster" and "Knight". Continue at Step 5.
  }}

  '''Machina Redeployment'''

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Machina Redeployment]]" + 1 card in hand
  | end     = "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" pointing to "[[R.B. Ga10 Driller]]" and "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]", with "[[Machina Citadel]]" in GY, "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]" in the Field Zone and 2 cards drawn
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[Machina Redeployment]]", discard 1 card and add "[[Machina Gearframe]]" and "[[Machina Unclaspare]]"
  # "Unclaspare" effect to summon itself, send "[[Machina Fortress]]" to GY
  # Summon "Gearframe", add "[[Machina Citadel]]" to hand.
  # Overlay "Gearframe" and "Unclaspare" for "[[Gear Gigant X]]"
  # Effect of "Gear Gigant X" to search for either "[[R.B. Ga10 Driller]]" or "[[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]"
  # Overlay for "[[Drill Driver Vespenato]]" using "Gear Gigant"
  # Summon "Fortress" using "Citadel" as cost
  # Link Summon "[[Ancient Gear Ballista]]" using "Vespenato" and "Fortress"
  # Effect of "Ballista" to add "[[Ancient Gear Box]]", whose effect adds "[[Infinitrack Tunneller]]"
  # Summon "Fortress" using "Box" and "Tunneller" as cost
  # Link Summon "[[R.B. The Brute Blues]]" using "Ballista" and "Fortress"
  # Effect of "Brute Blues" to add either "Ga10 Driller" or "Ga10 Cutter" (or "[[R.B. Funk Dock]]", and then one of the aforementioned cards)
  # Summon "Ga10 Driller" and "Ga10 Cutter" to zones that "Brute Blues" points to
  # Draw 2 cards by using "Tunneller" to shuffle "Gear Gigant", "Vespenato", "Ballista", "Gearframe" and "Box" back into Deck
