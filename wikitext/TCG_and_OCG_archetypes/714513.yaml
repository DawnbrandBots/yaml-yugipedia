  == Etymology & Design ==
  "Despia"/"Despian" is a combination of the words "despair", "death", and "thespian". The names of "Despia" cards stems from theatrical elements and drama. The theatrical theme of the "Despia" archetype is fitting, as these monsters kept up the facade of a [[Dogmatika Nation|holy Church]] for a long time, as if they were playing a theatrical fiction, before revealing their true colors.

  Most of the "Despia" cards consist of corrupted versions of the "[[Dogmatika]]" monsters. This may have been started with the events depicted in the artwork of "[[Dogmatikalamity]]", where "[[Dogmatika Maximus]]" opens a portal to the Hole.

  == Playing style ==
  === General ===
  The "Despia" archetype is primarily a [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]]-focused archetype, and is a part of an overarching playstyle, typically called "Branded Despia", that encompasses "Despia", the "[[Branded]]" archetype of Spell & Trap cards, "[[Fallen of Albaz]]" and its dedicated support cards, especially the Fusion Monsters that mention "Fallen of Albaz" as material (typically referred to as "[[Albaz Dragon]]s"). Within Branded Despia, "Despia" provides the Deck's Main Deck starters and Fusion Material fodder.

  Generally speaking, "Despia" cards and their specific "Branded" support cards generically support Level 8 or higher Fusion Monsters, while specific "Despia" cards support "Branded" or "Fallen of Albaz"-related cards (and vice-versa), connecting it to the other two card series in Branded Despia. Noteworthy "Branded" cards that specifically support "Despia" monsters include: "[[Branded Opening]]" (which can search or Special Summon a "Despia" monster from the Deck), "[[Branded in Red]]" (which can add a "Despia" monster or "Fallen of Albaz" from the GY to the hand, then can Fusion Summon a Level 8 or higher Fusion Monster by banishing monsters from the user's field or hand), "[[Branded Banishment]]" (which revives a "Despia" monster, then Fusion Summons a Level 8 or higher Fusion Monster by banishing monsters from either field).

  "[[Aluber the Jester of Despia]]" searches a "Branded" Spell/Trap when Normal or Special Summoned, making it a key starter of any "Branded-Despia" strategy. The following three "Despia" Main Deck monsters provide Branded Despia with advantage-generating Fusion Materials. Both "[[Dramaturge of Despia]]" and "[[Ad Libitum of Despia]]" each have Trigger Effects that generate advantage when they're sent to the [[GY]] or [[banish]]ed from the hand or field as a [[Fusion Material]] for a [[Fusion Summon]]; "Dramaturge" Special Summons itself while "Ad Libitum" can Special Summon back another "Despia" or a Level 8 or higher Fusion Monster from the GY or is banished. "[[Despian Tragedy]]", when banished or sent to the GY by any card effect, can search another "Despia" monster from the Deck, while also having the utility of banishing itself to recur "Branded" Spells/Traps from the GY. "[[Despian Comedy]]" can ward off against the opponent's effects that target a "Despia" monster, and can situationally Tribute a Fusion Monster to revive itself from the GY at any time.

  The "Despia"-centric Fusion Monsters include "[[Despian Quaeritis]]", "[[Despian Proskenion]]" and "[[Masquerade the Blazing Dragon]]", each requiring a "Despia" monster and a LIGHT or DARK monster (or both 1 LIGHT and 1 DARK in the case of "Proskenion"). "Quaeritis" can make all monsters except Level 8 or higher Fusion Monsters have 0 ATK, while floating into a "Despia" monster or "Fallen of Albaz", "Proskenion" can banish an opponent's Extra Deck monster from the GY (or even revive it to the user's field). Finally, "Masquerade" passively forces the opponent to pay 600 [[LP]] each time they wish to activate a card or effect and can revive itself from the GY in a pinch.

  The main strategy of "Branded Despia" is to quickly Summon "Aluber, the Jester of Despia" who will search the "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" Spell "[[Branded Fusion]]". This card can Fusion Summon one of the many Fusion Monsters that mention "[[Fallen of Albaz]]" as material, as listed below:

  {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
  ! Fusion Monster
  ! [[Fusion Material]]s (other than Fallen of Albaz)
  ! Effects and notes
  |-
  | "[[Titaniklad the Ash Dragon]]"
  |1 monster with 2500 ATK
  |Gains ATK depending on the combined levels of the Fusion Materials and is unaffected by the activated effects of monsters Special Summoned from the Extra Deck on the turn it is Fusion Summoned, making it a potent beatstick. Searches or Special Summons a "Dogmatika" monster or "Fallen of Albaz" as its GY End Phase effect. Typically used to Summon: 
  *"[[Guiding Quem, the Virtuous]]", which can send "Fallen of Albaz" or a card that mentions it. It can revive one of such monsters from the GY if a card leaves the Extra Deck, allowing the effect of "Fallen of Albaz" to fuse with the monster the opponent just Summoned from their Extra Deck.
  *"[[Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous]]", which can search "[[Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted]]", which can then Special Summon itself from the hand during the Main Phase as a Quick Effect and negate a monster's effect.
  |-
  | "[[Brigrand the Glory Dragon]]"
  |1 Level 8 or higher monster
  |Immune to battle destruction and while Fusion Summoned, the opponent cannot target other monsters you control by their card effects. Searches or Special Summons a "Tri-Brigade" monster or "Fallen of Albaz" as its GY End Phase effect. Typically used for searching "[[Tri-Brigade Mercourier]]" who acts as a hand trap that negates monster effects.
  |-
  | "[[Sprind the Irondash Dragon]]"
  |1 Effect Monster Special Summoned this turn
  |Can move itself to another Main Monster Zone, then destroying all other face-up cards in its column. Searches or Special Summons a "[[Springans]]" monster or "Fallen of Albaz" from the Deck as its GY End Phase effect. Typically used for searching "[[Springans Kitt]]" who can search or recover "Branded" Spells/Traps though the user must place one card in their hand to the bottom of their Deck afterwards.
  |-
  | "[[Albion the Branded Dragon]]
  |1 [[LIGHT]] monster
  |Upon Fusion Summon, it can Fusion Summon another Level 8 or lower Fusion Monster by banishing its materials from your hand, field or GY. Adds or [[Set]]s a "Branded" Spell/Trap from the Deck as its GY End Phase effect. Typically used for searching various disruptions (e.g. "[[Branded in Red]]", "[[Branded Banishment]]", "[[Branded Retribution]]", "[[The Fallen & The Virtuous]]") or combo enablers for the user's next turn (e.g. "Branded Opening", "Branded Fusion").
  |-
  |"[[Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon]]"
  |1 Fusion, [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]], [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] or [[Link Monster]]
  |Main boss monster which can send a Fusion Monster that mentions "Fallen of Albaz" from Extra Deck to GY to banish any monster on the field as a Quick Effect, though it cannot use this effect during the next turn (though this can be circumvented by making that "Mirrorjade" leave the field then re-Summoning it or another copy of it). Also destroys all of the opposing monsters during the End Phase should the opponent remove it from the field.
  |-
  |"[[Lubellion the Searing Dragon]]"
  |1 [[DARK]] monster
  |Upon Fusion Summon, after a discard cost, it can Fusion Summon 1 Level 8 or lower Fusion Monster by shuffling its materials from the field, GY or banishment but "Lubellion" cannot attack for the rest of that turn.
  |-
  |"[[Alba-Lenatus the Abyss Dragon]]"
  |1+ Dragon monsters
  |Can also be Special Summoned via [[Contact Fusion]] using monsters from either player's field, making it a useful counter against other [[Dragon]] strategies, and can attack opposing monsters up to the number of materials used for this card's Special Summon. Searches a "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" or "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" [[Normal Spell Card]] as its GY End Phase effect.
  |-
  |"[[Rindbrumm the Striking Dragon]]"
  |1 [[Beast]], [[Beast-Warrior]] or [[Winged Beast]] monster
  |Can negate in response to a Fusion, Synchro, Xyz or Link Monster activating its effect, then can return one monster on the field to the hand. During the opponent's turn, as a Quick Effect, the player can choose either between this card and 1 "Fallen of Albaz" in the GY, to Special Summon one of them while banishing the other, making it useful as a self-revival tool, or enables "Fallen of Albaz" to use its effect to fuse with an opponent's monster.
  |-
  |"[[Albion the Sanctifire Dragon]]
  |1 LIGHT Spellcaster monster
  |Cannot be targeted by the opponent's card effects. During the oppponent's turn as a Quick Effect, it can Special Summon two monsters from the GY(s), one to each player's field. Typically used to Summon monsters with hindering effects for the opponent, such as "[[Gimmick Puppet Nightmare]]" or "[[Ido the Supreme Magical Force]]", or Summon "Fallen of Albaz" to the user's field to use its Fusion Summoning effect. Also has a niche self-revival effect that requires Tributing 4 monsters in specific [[Monster Zone]]s.
  |-
  |"[[Alba System Dogmatikalamity]]"
  |6 monsters in your GY with different names
  |Boasts 4500 ATK and can attack all monsters the opponent's control though it cannot attack unless the user sends a Fusion Monster that mentions "Fallen of Albaz" as material. Can mill both players' Extra Decks to the GY though it requires having 6+ Fusion Monsters that mention "Fallen of Albaz" as material.
  |-
  |"[[The Dragon that Devours the Dogma]]
  |1 LIGHT or DARK monster + 1 Effect Monster
  |Upon Special Summon, it can shuffle 2 cards from the GY(s) or banishment into the Deck. Gains 500 ATK and is immune to all other cards' effects while an "[[Ecclesia]]" monster is in the GY. Can search a "Dogmatika" or "Tri-Brigade" card as its GY End Phase effect.
  |}

  By triggering the effects of the aforementioned Main Deck "Despia" monsters on the opponent's turn with Spell Speed 2, GY-utilizing "Branded" Fusion cards like "[[Branded in Red]]" or "[[Branded Banishment]]", and by summoning Fusion Monsters with disruptive effects like "[[Guardian Chimera]]" and "[[Khaos Starsource Dragon]]", the Deck can rapidly generate advantage over the opponent during their turn, making it easier to finish the game on the player's next turn. 

  === Other additions ===
  Other cards that supplement the playstyle of "Branded-Despia" are those of "Fallen of Albaz"-related cards besides the aformentioned "Branded Fusion". Notably, all of these monsters alongside "Fallen of Albaz" can be searched with "[[Branded Lost]]" (which also protects the Deck's Fusion Summoning effects from having their activations negated and prevents the opponent from using card effects in response to the user's Fusion Summon).

  * "[[Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous]]" can Tribute itself to Special Summon "Fallen of Albaz" from the deck as a Quick Effect. It can then be recovered from the GY if a Fusion Monster was sent to the GY that turn. Also can be used with "The Fallen & The Virtuous" or "The Dragon that Devours the Dogma".
  * "[[Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous]]" can allow the player to conduct Fusion Summons during the Main Phase as a Quick Effect, and she can be used along with one DARK or LIGHT monster to Fusion Summon her own specific Fusion Monster form, "[[Granguignol the Dusk Dragon]]". If Fusion Summoned, "Granguignol" can dump any Level 6 or higher LIGHT or DARK monster from the Deck or Extra Deck, and can banish itself from the field or GY to Special Summon a "Despia" monster from the Extra Deck or a "Dogmatika" monster from the Main Deck. "Blazing Cartesia" can then be recovered from the GY if a Fusion Monster was sent to the GY that turn.
  * "[[Albion the Shrouded Dragon]]" can strategically send "Fallen of Albaz" or 1 "Branded" Spell/Trap from the Deck or hand to the GY as cost to recycle (while also alllowing a draw if used from the hand) or Special Summon itself respectively, enabling the GY effects of such cards such as "Branded Opening" protecting the deck's endboard of Fusion Monsters or retrieving other "Branded" Spells/Traps in the GY by dumping "[[Branded Retribution]]".

  "Branded-Despia" Decks often likes to have their Fusion Monsters be sent to the GY (typically the Albaz Dragons) to trigger the effects of those sent monsters to search or Special Summon more cards, and effects of other cards (such as "Incredible Ecclesia" and "Blazing Cartesia") to recur themselves back to the hand, forming various resource loops. The "[[Dogmatika]]" archetype can be a situationally useful tool for this purpose; despite that most "Dogmatika" cards prevent the player from Summoning from the Extra Deck, they can instead send cards with GY effects to set up plays for subsequent turns. In a "Branded-Despia" strategy, the "Dogmatika" cards used are just "Guiding Quem", "Titaniklad", "Granguignol", "[[Nadir Servant]]", "[[Dogmatika Maximus]]", "The Fallen & The Virtuous" and "The Dragon that Devours the Dogma". "Nadir Servant" is also a powerful tool to send Extra Deck monsters to the GY, then it can search or recover "[[Dogmatika Maximus]]". "Maximus" can Summon itself easily and then send two more monsters from the Extra Deck to the GY (such as "Titaniklad" and "Albion the Branded Dragon"), setting up the player's resources for the next turn. "The Fallen & The Virtuous" is able to destroy a face-up card by sending any Fusion Monster and benefits from "Branded" support. As mentioned before, "Granguignol" can opt to Special Summon a "Dogmatika" monster. Netherless, all "Dogmatika" monsters can be used as elligble Fusion Materials for Albaz Dragons, especially "Albion the Branded Dragon" and "[[Albion the Sanctifire Dragon]]".

  The "[[Bystial]]" archetype synergizes very well with "Branded-Despia"; besides their generic DARK, LIGHT and/or [[Dragon]] support utilized in other decks, "[[The Bystial Lubellion]]" and "[[Bystial Saronir]]" also support "Branded" Spells/Traps that the Branded-Despia playstyle can benefit with. Specifically, "The Bystial Lubellion" can be used as a material for a variety of DARK Dragon-type Albaz Dragons (namely "[[Albion the Branded Dragon]]", "[[Titaniklad the Ash Dragon]]", and "[[Alba-Lenatus the Abyss Dragon]]"), then the Fusion Monster can be Tributed to Summon "The Bystial Lubellion" from the GY and utilize "Branded" Continuous Spells and Traps, while allowing the Tributed monster to get its search effect off during the End Phase. Noteworthy cards to place include "Branded Lost" (for supplementing the Deck's Fusion Summon playstyle), "[[Branded Regained]]" (for recovering banished cards and a draw, as well as reviving other "Bystial" monsters) or "[[Branded Beast]]" (for a Quick-Effect-like pop effect). "[[Bystial Saronir]]" also has the utility of dumping "Branded" Spells/Traps (similar to "Albion the Shrouded Dragon").

  While the primary playstyle of "Branded" and "Despia" is to Fusion Summon their Fusion Monsters, the theme can also facilitate a small degree of [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] plays. Since their various cards restrict the user from Special Summoning Extra Deck monsters other than Fusion Monsters during their turn, this can only be done during the opponent's turn via "[[Etude of the Branded]]". Using the various themes' Level 4 Tuners (such as "[[Ecclesia]]" monsters, their counterparts or "[[The Bystial Aluber]]") paired with a Dragon monster (such as the "Bystial" monsters and some of the Albaz Dragons), "Etude of the Branded" can facilitate the Synchro Summon of a variety of useful Level 10 or 12 Synchro Monsters, including the sole Synchro Monster of "Despia", "[[Despian Luluwalilith]]". "Luluwalilith" can make all of the user's monsters gain 500 ATK and negate the effect of a card on the field whenever a card leaves the Extra Deck. If it is sent to the GY, it can Special Summon LIGHT Spellcasters such as "Ecclesia" monsters, "Blazing Cartesia" or "Guiding Quem". "[[Fallen of the White Dragon]]" (whose name is always treated as "Fallen of Albaz") can make plays of its own by sending a monster from the Extra Deck that mentions "Fallen of Albaz" to Special Summon itself from the hand, then it can Special Summon an "Ecclesia" monster. It is useful for summoning "Incredible Ecclesia" which can be used for an easy Level 8 Synchro Monster such as "[[Ecclesia of the Black Dragon]]", which has a Quick Effect to Special Summon "Fallen of Albaz" or any Level 4 or lower monster that mentions it from the Deck or GY to access the original "Fallen of Albaz" to fuse with the opponent's monster(s), "Blazing Cartesia" for its Fusion Summon effect, etc.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Negating the effect of "[[Branded Fusion]]" with a common staple such as "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" and "[[Dominus Impulse]]" can often severely limit the Deck's plays. If the effect of a card like "Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring" negates the effect of "Branded Fusion" but not the activation of "Branded Fusion", this cannot be prevented by "[[Branded Lost]]" (or similar cards such as "[[Magical Meltdown]]").
  ** Using "Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring" against "Branded Fusion" enables "[[Triple Tactics Thrust]]" to be used, which can Set "[[Fusion Duplication]]" from the Deck that can copy "Branded Fusion"'s effect, allowing "Branded Fusion" plays to be used during the opponent's turn instead.
  * As a Fusion-focused deck, cards like "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" and "[[Non-Fusion Area]]" can often shut down the Deck.
  * Opposing cards that can remove monsters out of the GY (ideally those with Quick Effects such as "[[D.D. Crow]]" and "[[Bystial]]" monsters) can deny the Deck from gaining advantage from their Albaz Dragons and other monsters being sent to the GY. These cards can also be used to banish the targets of "[[Branded in Red]]" and "[[Branded Banishment]]" to prevent them from fully resolving.
  * Cards like "[[Gravekeeper's Inscription]]", "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" and "[[Soul Drain]]" can prevent their advantage-generating or recovery effects that activate in the GY (or negate said effects), slowing down their strategy.
