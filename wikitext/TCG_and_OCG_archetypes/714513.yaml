  == Etymology & Design ==
  "Despia"/"Despian" is a combination of the words "despair", "death", and "thespian". The names of "Despia" cards stems from theatrical elements and drama. The theatrical theme of the "Despia" archetype is fitting, as these monsters kept up the facade of a [[Dogmatika Nation|holy Church]] for a long time, as if they were playing a theatrical fiction, before revealing their true colors.

  Most of the "Despia" cards consist of corrupted versions of the "[[Dogmatika]]" monsters. This may have been started with the events depicted in the artwork of "[[Dogmatikalamity]]", where "[[Dogmatika Maximus]]" opens a portal to the Hole.

  == Playing style ==
  === General ===
  The "Despia" archetype is a [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]]-focused archetype, and is a part of an overarching playstyle, typically called "Branded Despia", that encompasses "Despia", the "[[Branded]]" archetype of Spell & Trap cards, "[[Fallen of Albaz]]" and its dedicated support cards, especially the Fusion Monsters that mention "Fallen of Albaz" as material (typically referred to as "[[Albaz Dragon]]s"). Within Branded Despia, "Despia" provides the Deck's Main Deck starters and Fusion Material fodder.

  Generally speaking, "Despia" cards and their specific "Branded" support cards generically support Level 8 or higher Fusion Monsters, while specific "Despia" cards support "Branded" or "Fallen of Albaz"-related cards (and vice-versa), connecting it to the other two card series in Branded Despia. Noteworthy "Branded" cards that specifically support "Despia" monsters include "[[Branded Opening]]" (which can search or Special Summon a "Despia" monster from the Deck), "[[Branded in Red]]" (which can add a "Despia" monster or "Fallen of Albaz" from the GY to the hand, then can Fusion Summon a Level 8 or higher Fusion Monster by banishing monsters from the user's field or hand), "[[Branded Banishment]]" (which revives a "Despia" monster, then Fusion Summons a Level 8 or higher Fusion Monster by banishing monsters from either field).

  "[[Aluber the Jester of Despia]]" searches a "Branded" Spell/Trap when Normal or Special Summoned, making it a key starter of any "Branded-Despia" strategy. The following three "Despia" Main Deck monsters provide Branded Despia with advantage-generating Fusion Materials. Both "[[Dramaturge of Despia]]" and "[[Ad Libitum of Despia]]" each have Trigger Effects that generate advantage when they're sent to the [[GY]] or [[banish]]ed from the hand or field as a [[Fusion Material]] for a [[Fusion Summon]]; "Dramaturge" Special Summons itself while "Ad Libitum" can Special Summon back another "Despia" or a Level 8 or higher Fusion Monster from the GY or is banished. "[[Despian Tragedy]]", when banished or sent to the GY by any card effect, can search another "Despia" monster from the Deck, while also having the utility of
  banishing itself to recur "Branded" Spells/Traps from the GY. "[[Despian Comedy]]" can ward off against the opponent's effects that target a "Despia" monster, and can situationally Tribute a Fusion Monster to revive itself from the GY at any time.

  The "Despia"-centric Fusion Monsters include "[[Despian Quaeritis]]", "[[Despian Proskenion]]" and "[[Masquerade the Blazing Dragon]]", each requiring a "Despia" monster and a LIGHT or DARK monster (or both 1 LIGHT and 1 DARK in the case of "Proskenion"). "Quaeritis" can make all monsters except Level 8 or higher Fusion Monsters have 0 ATK, while floating into a "Despia" monster or "Fallen of Albaz", "Proskenion" can banish an opponent's Extra Deck monster from the GY (or even revive it to the user's field). Finally, "Masquerade" passively forces the opponent to pay 600 [[LP]] each time they wish to activate a card or effect and can revive itself from the GY in a pinch.

  The main strategy of "Branded Despia" is to quickly Summon "Aluber, the Jester of Despia" who will search the "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" Spell "[[Branded Fusion]]". This card can Fusion Summon "[[Albion the Branded Dragon]]" or "[[Lubellion the Searing Dragon]]" using materials from the Deck. From there, "Albion"/"Lubellion" would typically bridge into the powerful boss monster of Branded Despia, "[[Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon]]". "Mirrorjade's" main effect, at anytime, can send an Albaz Dragon from the Extra Deck to the GY to not only banish any monster on the field as a disruption, but to also gain advantage from the effects of their sent Albaz Dragons effects to search and/or Special Summon more cards during the End Phase ("Albion the Branded Dragon" for more "Branded" Spells/Traps, "[[Brigrand the Glory Dragon]]" for "[[Tri-Brigade Mercourier]]" as a [[hand trap]] etc.), completing the Deck's resource loop.

  By triggering the effects of the aforementioned Main Deck "Despia" monsters on the opponent's turn with Spell Speed 2, GY-utilizing "Branded" Fusion cards like "[[Branded in Red]]" or "[[Branded Banishment]]", and by summoning Fusion Monsters with disruptive effects like "[[Guardian Chimera]]", the Deck can rapidly generate advantage in the opponent's turn, making it easier to finish the game on the player's next turn. 

  === Other additions ===
  Other cards that supplement the playstyle of "Branded-Despia" are those of "Fallen of Albaz"-related cards besides the aformentioned "Branded Fusion". Notably, all of these monsters alongside "Fallen of Albaz" can be searched with "[[Branded Lost]]" (which also protects the Deck's Fusion Summoning effects from having their activations negated and prevents the opponent from using card effects in response to the user's Fusion Summon).

  * "[[Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous]]" can Tribute itself to Special Summon "Fallen of Albaz" from the deck as a Quick Effect. It can then be recovered from the GY if a Fusion Monster was sent to the GY that turn.
  * "[[Guiding Quem, the Virtuous]]" (who is also treated as a "[[Dogmatika]]" card and a "Despia" card) can send a card that mentions "Fallen of Albaz" from the Deck to the GY and can Summon a monster from the GY that mentions "Fallen of Albaz" (ie. Albaz Dragons, "Despian Quaeritis" and the other cards in this list) if a card leaves the Extra Deck.
  * "[[Blazing Cartesia, the Virtuous]]" can allow the player to conduct Fusion Summons during the Main Phase as a Quick Effect, and she can be used along with one DARK or LIGHT monster to Fusion Summon her own specific Fusion Monster form, "[[Granguignol the Dusk Dragon]]". If Fusion Summoned, "Granguignol" can dump any Level 6 or higher LIGHT or DARK monster from the Deck or Extra Deck, and can banish itself from the field or GY to Special Summon a "Despia" monster from the Extra Deck or a "Dogmatika" monster from the Main Deck. "Blazing Cartesia" can then be recovered from the GY if a Fusion Monster was sent to the GY that turn.
  * "[[Springans Kitt]]" also acts as another "Branded" searcher or can recycle those cards in the GY or banishment, though the user must place one card from their hand into the Deck.
  * "[[Tri-Brigade Mercourier]]" acts as a [[hand trap]] to negate monster effects while controlling a Fusion Monster that mentions "Fallen of Albaz" and if banished, it can allow a search of any of the other monsters that mention "Fallen of Albaz".
  * "[[Albion the Shrouded Dragon]]" can strategically send any "Branded" Spell/Trap to the GY as cost to recycle or Special Summon itself, enabling the GY effects of such cards such as "Branded Opening" protecting the deck's endboard of Fusion Monsters or retrieving other "Branded" Spells/Traps in the GY by dumping "[[Branded Retribution]]".

  The Deck often likes to have their Fusion Monsters be sent to the GY (typically the Albaz Dragons as material) to trigger the effects of those sent monsters to search or Special Summon more cards, and effects of other cards (such as "Incredible Ecclesia" and "Blazing Cartesia") to recur themselves back to the hand.

  The "[[Bystial]]" archetype synergizes very well with "Branded-Despia"; besides their generic DARK, LIGHT and/or [[Dragon]] support utilized in other decks, "[[The Bystial Lubellion]]" and "[[Bystial Saronir]]" also support "Branded" Spells/Traps that the Branded-Despia playstyle can benefit with. Specifically, "The Bystial Lubellion" can be used as a material for a variety of DARK Dragon-type Albaz Dragons (namely "[[Albion the Branded Dragon]]", "[[Titaniklad the Ash Dragon]]", and "[[Alba-Lenatus the Abyss Dragon]]"), then the Fusion Monster can be Tributed to Summon "The Bystial Lubellion" from the GY and utilize "Branded" Continuous Spells and Traps, while allowing the Tributed monster to get its search effect off during the End Phase. Noteworthy cards to place include "Branded Lost" (for supplementing the Deck's Fusion Summon playstyle), "[[Branded Regained]]" (for recovering banished cards and a draw, as well as reviving other "Bystial" monsters) or "[[Branded Beast]]" (for a Quick-Effect-like pop effect). "[[Bystial Saronir]]" also has the utility of dumping "Branded" Spells/Traps (similar to "Albion the Shrouded Dragon").

  While the primary playstyle of "Branded" and "Despia" is to Fusion Summon their Fusion Monsters, the archetypes can also facilitate a small degree of [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] plays. Since their various cards restrict the user from Special Summoning Extra Deck monsters other than Fusion Monsters during their turn, this can only be done during the opponent's turn via "[[Etude of the Branded]]". Using the various themes' Level 4 Tuners (such as Ecclesia's counterparts or "[[The Bystial Aluber]]") paired with a Dragon monster (such as the "Bystial" monsters and some of the Albaz Dragons), "Etude of the Branded" can facilitate the Synchro Summon of a variety of useful Level 10 or 12 Synchro Monsters, including the sole Synchro Monster of "Despia", "[[Despian Luluwalilith]]". Netherless, one can also send "Despian Luluwalilith" to the GY as a means to Special Summon "Incredible Ecclesia", "Blazing Cartesia" or "Guiding Quem".

  The "[[Dogmatika]]" archetype can be a situationally useful tool to supplement "Branded-Despia" despite that most "Dogmatika" cards prevent the player from Summoning from the Extra Deck. In a "Branded-Despia" strategy, the "Dogmatika" cards used are just "Guiding Quem", "Titaniklad", "Granguignol", "[[Nadir Servant]]" and "[[Dogmatika Maximus]]". "Nadir Servant" is also a powerful tool to send Extra Deck monsters to the GY, then it can search or recover "[[Dogmatika Maximus]]". "Maximus" can Summon itself easily and then send two more monsters from the Extra Deck to the GY (where sending "Titaniklad" to the GY can Special Summon "Guiding Quem" for its effects), setting up the player's resources for the next turn. As mentioned before, "Granguignol" can opt to Special Summon a "Dogmatika" monster. Netherless, all "Dogmatika" monsters can be used as elligble Fusion Materials for Albaz Dragons, especially "Albion the Branded Dragon" and "[[Albion the Sanctifire Dragon]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Negating the effect of "[[Branded Fusion]]" with a common staple such as "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" and "[[Dominus Impulse]]" can often severely limit the Deck's plays. If the effect of a card like "Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring" negates the effect of "Branded Fusion" but not the activation of "Branded Fusion", this cannot be prevented by "[[Branded Lost]]" (or similar cards such as "[[Magical Meltdown]]").
  * As a Fusion-focused deck, cards like "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" and "[[Non-Fusion Area]]" can often shut down the Deck.
  * Opposing cards that can remove monsters out of the GY (ideally those with Quick Effects such as "[[D.D. Crow]]" and "[[Bystial]]" monsters) can also deny the Deck from gaining advantage from their Albaz Dragons and other Extra Deck monsters being sent to the GY. These cards can also be used to banish the targets of "[[Branded in Red]]" and "[[Branded Banishment]]" to prevent them from fully resolving.
  * Cards like "[[Abyss Dweller]]", "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" and "[[Soul Drain]]" can prevent their advantage-generating or recovery effects that activate in the GY (or negate said effects), slowing down their strategy.
