  It is related to the "[[Speedroid]]" and "[[Synchro Dragon]]" archetypes. Despite its name, this archetype is not related to the [[Clear]] series.

  == Playing style ==
  As with the "Synchro Dragon" archetype, the members of the "Clear Wing" archetype is focused on monster negating monster effects, destroying monsters, and modifying a monster's ATK in their favor (either most of the "Clear Wing" monsters gaining ATK with most members, or "Fast Dragon" changing a monster's ATK to 0). Despite sharing these common effects, the varied and specific [[Synchro Material]]s for each member makes it difficult for a single deck to use all of them together. As such, the cards of this archetype can be divided into at least two different playstyles as suggested by the archetypes they are also members of or support for: "[[Speedroid]]" and "[[Odd-Eyes]]"/[[Supreme King]] (alongside "[[Performapal]]" and "[[Magician]]").

  The two Level 7 members, "[[Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]" and "[[Clear Wing Fast Dragon]]", are primarily the first members to be Summoned due to their easy [[Synchro Material]] requirements, having moderately powerful monster negating effects suitable in various situations for either playstyle. They can also be used as Synchro Materials to be used to Synchro Summon the higher-level members of this archetype and the related "[[Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon]]". Due to "Fast Dragon" being a [[Pendulum Monster]], it has the versatility of being Special Summoned from the face-up Extra Deck by either a [[Pendulum Summon]] or if used for going into "[[Hi-Speedroid Clear Wing Rider]]", "Fast Dragon" can be Summoned back alongside another Level 7 WIND Synchro (such as "Clear Wing Synchro Dragon") from the Extra Deck during the opponent's turn through the effect of "Clear Wing Rider".

  "[[Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing]]" trades negating monster effects for more destruction, making it valuable for going second or for disrupting the opponent if the card is able to be Synchro Summoned during the opponent's turn. While "[[Odd-Eyes Wing Dragon]]" has an [[Ignition Effect]] to negate any monster's effects for a turn, it also has a useful [[Pendulum Scale]] value of 10 while granting an "[[Honest]]"-like effect on any monster the user control as its Pendulum Effect. Due to "Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing" and "Odd-Eyes Wing Dragon" being DARK Synchro Monsters and require DARK monsters as Synchro Materials, these are more suited for the "Odd-Eyes"/Supreme King strategies.

  The introduction of "[[Crystal Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]" finally gives the archetype a way to deal with Spell/Trap effects (whereas all the other members only dealt with monsters and/or their effects), yet retaining a unique method of dealing with monsters and gaining ATK, but it also stands out from the rest of the archetype by having a floating effect to search any [[WIND]] monster if it's destroyed. It can be easily used within a "Speedroid" deck as "[[Hi-Speedroid Cork Shooter]]" easily enable this card's Summon and "Crystal Clear Wing" can also search any WIND monster upon its destruction. Finally, the archetype's newest boss monster "[[Crystal Clear Wing Over Synchro Dragon]]" can universally negate the activation of almost any card or effect, then floats into any other monster of this archetype if it leaves the field.

  In addition to "Crystal Clear Wing Over Synchro Dragon", new "Speedroid" and "Clear Wing" crossover support cards introduced in ''[[Supreme Darkness]]'' have further strengthened the archetypes' playability. "[[Speedroid Clackernel]]" allows "Speedroid" decks to easily set up the Synchro Summon of "Clear Wing Synchro Dragon" by placing "[[Speedroid Wing Synchron]]" into the [[Pendulum Zone]] via "Clackernel's" [[Pendulum Effect]], then using the Pendulum Effect of "Speedroid Wing Synchron" to directly Synchro Summon "Clear Wing Synchro Dragon" by destroying itself and "Clackernel" in the Pendulum Zones. When destroyed and added to the face-up Extra Deck, this also triggers the monster effects of both "Clackernel" and "Wing Synchron"; the former Special Summons another copy of itself as a Tuner for additional Synchro plays while also setting up for its second effect to boost a "Clear Wing" monster's ATK in battle while the latter can one "Speedroid" Spell/Trap from the Deck to the GY, setting up "Speedroid Clear Wing Wander" for its GY effect. "[[Hi-Speedroid Glider 2]]" can be used to Summon back "Clear Wing Synchro Dragon", easily setting up the Synchro Summon of "Crystal Clear Wing Over Synchro Dragon". Once in the GY, "Hi-Speedroid Glider 2" can banish itself to raise the opponent's monsters' Levels by 5, easily disrupting any Level-based plays. 

  Finally, the archetype's first [[Trap Card]], "[[Speedroid Clear Wing Wander]]", can be used to destroy cards on the field. Then it can immediately banish itself from the GY to banish any WIND Synchro Monster from the field and return it back, allowing the [[once per turn]] effects of negating activations of cards/effects of the "Clear Wing" Synchro Monsters to be used once more.
