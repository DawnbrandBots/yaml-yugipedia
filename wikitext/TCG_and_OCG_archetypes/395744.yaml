  "'''Clear Wing'''" (クリアウィング ''Kuria Wingu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Synchro Monster]]s used by [[Yuya Sakaki]], [[Yugo]], [[Yuri]] and [[Z-ARC]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|manga]]. All members of this archetype are [[WIND]] [[Dragon]] [[Monster Card|monsters]], except for the [[DARK]] "[[Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing]]" and the [[Machine]] "[[Hi-Speedroid Clear Wing Rider]]".

  It is related to the "[[Speedroid]]" and "[[Synchro Dragon]]" archetypes. Despite its name, this archetype is not related to the [[Clear]] series.

  == Members ==
  "Odd-Eyes Wing Dragon" and "Starving Venom Wing Dragon" are not members of the "Clear Wing" archetype, but are support cards for it.

  == Playing style ==
  As with the "Synchro Dragon" archetype, the members of the "Clear Wing" archetype is focused on monster negating monster effects, destroying monsters, and modifying a monster's ATK in their favor (either most of the "Clear Wing" monsters gaining ATK with most members, or "Fast Dragon" changing a monster's ATK to 0). Despite sharing these common effects, the varied and specific [[Synchro Material]]s for each member makes it difficult for a single deck to use all of them together. As such, the cards of this archetype can be divided into at least three different playstyles as suggested by the archetypes they are also members of or support for: "[[Speedroid]]", "[[Odd-Eyes]]"/[[Supreme King]] (alongside "[[Performapal]]" and "[[Magician]]") and "[[Starving Venom]]"/"[[Predap]]([[Predaplant|lant]])".

  The two Level 7 members, "[[Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]" and "[[Clear Wing Fast Dragon]]", are primarily the first members to be Summoned due to their easy [[Synchro Material]] requirements, having moderately powerful monster negating effects suitable in various situations for either playstyle. They are also the easiest Synchro Materials to be used to Synchro Summon the higher-level members/support of this archetype and the related "[[Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon]]". Due to "Fast Dragon" being a [[Pendulum Monster]], it has the versatility of being Special Summoned from the face-up Extra Deck by either a [[Pendulum Summon]] or if used as material to Synchro Summon "[[Hi-Speedroid Clear Wing Rider]]", "Fast Dragon" can be Summoned back alongside another Level 7 WIND Synchro Monster (such as "Clear Wing Synchro Dragon") from the Extra Deck during the opponent's turn through the effect of "Clear Wing Rider".

  "[[Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing]]" trades negating monster effects for more destruction, making it valuable for going second or for disrupting the opponent if the card is able to be Synchro Summoned during the opponent's turn. While "[[Odd-Eyes Wing Dragon]]" has an [[Ignition Effect]] to negate any monster's effects for a turn, it also has a useful [[Pendulum Scale]] value of 10 while granting an "[[Honest]]"-like effect on any monster the user control as its Pendulum Effect. "[[Starving Venom Wing Dragon]]" can negate an opponent's monster's effects that the opponent just Special Summoned, has the Quick Effect of destroying a card on the field whenever a card activates its effect on the field, and can constantly mark [[Predator Counter]]s on the opponent's monsters whenever they are Special Summoned. Due to "Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing" and "Odd-Eyes Wing Dragon" being DARK Synchro Monsters and require DARK monsters as Synchro Materials, these are more suited for the "Odd-Eyes"/Supreme King strategy (and likewise for "Starving Venom Wing Dragon" belonging to "Predaplant"/"Starving Venom" strategies).

  The introduction of "[[Crystal Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]" finally gives the archetype a way to deal with Spell/Trap effects (whereas all the other members only dealt with monsters and/or their effects), yet featuring a unique effect of dealing with opposing monsters by making itself unaffected by the opponent's activated monster effects for the rest of the turn and gaining ATK equal to that of the monster that activated its effect, but it also stands out from the rest of the archetype by having a floating effect to search any [[WIND]] monster if it is destroyed. It can be easily used within a "Speedroid" deck as "[[Hi-Speedroid Cork Shooter]]" easily enable this card's Synchro Summon and "Crystal Clear Wing" can also search any "Speedroid" monster upon its destruction. Finally, the archetype's newest boss monster "[[Crystal Clear Wing Over Synchro Dragon]]" can universally negate the activation of almost any card or effect, then floats into any other monster of this archetype if it leaves the field.

  Finally, the archetype's first [[Trap Card]], "[[Speedroid Clear Wing Wonder]]", can be used to destroy cards on the field up to the number of WIND Synchro Monsters with different Types they control. Then it can immediately banish itself from the GY to banish any WIND Synchro Monster from the field and return it back, allowing the [[once per turn]] effects of negating activations of cards/effects of the "Clear Wing" Synchro Monsters to be used once more (except "Clear Wing Fast Dragon").

  New "Speedroid" and "Clear Wing" crossover support cards introduced in ''[[Supreme Darkness]]'' have further strengthened the archetypes' playability. "[[Speedroid Colonel Clackers]]" allows "Speedroid" decks to easily set up the Synchro Summon of "Clear Wing Synchro Dragon" by placing "[[Speedroid Wing Synchron]]" into the [[Pendulum Zone]] via the [[Pendulum Effect]] of "Colonel Clackers", then using the Pendulum Effect of "Speedroid Wing Synchron" to directly Synchro Summon "Clear Wing Synchro Dragon" by destroying itself and "Colonel Clackers" in the Pendulum Zones. When destroyed and added to the face-up Extra Deck, this also triggers the monster effect of "Colonel Clackers" (and potentially "Wing Synchron"); the former Special Summons another copy of itself as a Tuner for additional Synchro plays while also setting up for its second effect to boost a "Clear Wing" monster's ATK in battle, while the latter can send one "Speedroid" Spell/Trap from the Deck to the GY, setting up "Speedroid Clear Wing Wonder" or "[[Speedroid Dupligate]]" for their GY effects. "[[Hi-Speedroid Glider 2]]" can be used to Summon back "Clear Wing Synchro Dragon", easily setting up the Synchro Summon of "Crystal Clear Wing Over Synchro Dragon". Once in the GY, "Hi-Speedroid Glider 2" can banish itself to raise the opponent's monsters' Levels by 5, easily disrupting any Level-based plays.
