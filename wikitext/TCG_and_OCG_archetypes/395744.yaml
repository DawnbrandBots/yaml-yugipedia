  "'''Clear Wing'''" (クリアウィング ''Kuria Wingu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Synchro Monster]]s used by [[Yuya Sakaki]], [[Yugo]],[[Yuri]] and [[Z-ARC]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|manga]]. All members of this archetype are [[WIND]] [[Dragon]]-[[Type]] [[Monster Card|monsters]], except for the [[DARK]] "[[Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing]]" and the [[Machine]] "[[Hi-Speedroid Clear Wing Rider]]".
  It is related to the "[[Synchro Dragon]]" archetype. Despite its name, this archetype is not related to the anime-only "[[Clear]]" archetype.
  == Playing style ==
  As with the "Synchro Dragon" archetype, the members of the "Clear Wing" archetype is focused on monster negating monster effects, destroying monsters, and modifying ATK in their favor. Despite sharing these common effects, the varied and specific [[Synchro Material]]s for each member makes it difficult for a single deck to use all of them together. As such, the cards of this archetype have at least two different playstyles as suggested by the archetypes they are also members of or support for: "[[Speedroid]]" and "[[Odd-Eyes]]"/"[[Supreme King]]"/"[[Magician]]".   
  The two Level 7 members, "[[Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]" and "[[Clear Wing Fast Dragon]]", are primarily the first members to be Summoned due to their easy [[Synchro Material]] requirements and both have powerful monster negating effects suitable in various situations for either playstyle. Due to the latter being a [[Pendulum Monster]], "Fast Dragon" is more suitable for being used as material to Synchro Summon the higher-level "Clear Wing" members/support as it can be Summoned back by either a [[Pendulum Summon]] or if used for going into "[[Hi-Speedroid Clear Wing Rider]]", "Fast Dragon" can be Summoned back alongside another Level 7 WIND Synchro (such as "Clear Wing Synchro Dragon") from the Extra Deck during the opponent's turn through the effect of "Clear Wing Rider".
  "[[Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing]]" trades negating monster effects for more destruction, making it valuable for going second or for disrupting the opponent if the card is able to be Synchro Summoned during the opponent's turn. While "[[Odd-Eyes Wing Dragon]]" has an [[Ignition Effect]] to negate any monster's effects for a turn, it also has a useful [[Pendulum Scale]] value of 10 while granting an [[Honest]]-like effect on any monster the user control as its Pendulum Effect.
  The introduction of "[[Crystal Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]" finally gives the archetype a way to deal with Spell/Trap effects (whereas all the other members only dealt with monsters and/or their effects). It can be easily used within a "Speedroid" deck as "[[Hi-Speedroid Cork Shooter]]" easily enable this card's Summon and "Crystal Clear Wing" can also search any WIND monster upon its destruction.
