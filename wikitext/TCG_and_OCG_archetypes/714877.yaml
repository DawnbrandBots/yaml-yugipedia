  {{Quote|Assemble at the end, savior maidens! Exorcise evil with a blessed miracle!!|source=The archetype's tagline in promotional material}}
  "'''Exosister'''" (エクソシスター ''Ekusoshisutā''), introduced in "[[Deck-Build Pack: Grand Creators]]", is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Spellcaster]] and [[Warrior]] monsters focused on [[Xyz Summon]]ing and countering [[Graveyard]] usage.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines#No. 04: Exosister}}

  == Etymology ==
  The archetype's name is a portmanteau of "[[wikipedia:Exorcist|exorcist]]" and "sister", a form of address for fellow female members of a religious order such as nuns. The Main Deck members use western female given names, with their corresponding Xyz forms combining them with those of [[wikipedia:archangel|archangel]]s.

  == Design ==
  [[File:Crest-Exosister.png|thumb|left|100px|The "Exosister" crest.]]
  The "Sister" forms of each member, represented by the [[Main Deck]] [[Spellcaster]] monsters, are wearing dark military-style uniforms. The "Exorcist" forms of each member, represented by the [[Warrior]] [[Xyz Monster]]s, are wearing modified white versions of their respective uniforms. Their weapons varies within a wide range of weaponry, from swords and spears to compound bows and rifles. Outside Japan, the dresses of the "Exosister" monsters are recolored to a brighter shade.

  The shared effect of the "Sister" members to [[Special Summon]] an "Exosister" Xyz Monster represents their transformation into their "Exorcist" counterparts.
  The archetype's cards and card effects are associated with the number 800:
  * Each Main Deck "Exosister" monster has 800 DEF, and each Extra Deck monster has a DEF that ends in 800.
  * "[[Exosister Gibrine]]" increases the ATK of Xyz Monsters by 800.
  * Each Main Deck "Exosister" monster (except "[[Exosister Martha]]") has an effect to gain 800 LP.
  * Each "Exosister" Spell/Trap with an LP payment cost requires paying 800 LP.
  The Extra Deck "Exosister" monsters all have ribbons made of holy water covering parts of their bodies and weapons. These ribbons are in the shape of the number 8, possibly referencing their card effects that often involve 800 points. Wings made of holy water flank the sides of some ribbons, forming a close resemblance toward the "Exosister" crest.

  === Members ===
  Each Main Deck "Exosister" monster mentions the name of another Main Deck "Exosister" monster in its effect text; this forms two pairs of "Exosister" monsters where each member references their counterpart in their effect text, and an additional single-direction reference in "Martha" (which in lore is explained as her being the former partner of "Elis").

  Each girl is also associated with a different celestial body, wields a different weapon, and wears a medallion that depicts it and has a jewel of a different color

  == Playing style ==
  "Exosister" is an [[Xyz Monster]]-based archetype focused on punishing the opponent for interacting with the [[Graveyard]]s, with conditional [[Trigger Effect]]s that allow the player to Xyz Summon monsters using only 1 "Exosister" monster.

  All "Exosister" Main Deck monsters have two effects: a shared 1-card-Xyz [[Trigger Effect]] that can be used if a card is moved out of a GY, and an individual effect.

  | Summons itself from hand & "Elis" from Deck, with restrictive activation conditions:
  * the player must control no monsters or only Xyz Monsters
  * the player must only Special Summon "Exosister" monsters this turn
  | Double extension
  |}

  The shared 1-card-Xyz effect allows Main Deck "Exosister" monsters to immediately turn into Xyz boss monsters (see below) with board control effects, even in the opponent's turn, if the opponent moves any card out of either GY. The condition of "the opponent moving a card out of either GY" can be triggered by the opponent moving cards via a card's [[cost]], [[effect]], or [[Summoning condition]]s (e.g. "[[ABC-Dragon Buster]]"). The opponent must be involved in the action; if the "Exosister" monster's controller moves a card out of their opponent's GY (e.g.: with "[[D.D. Crow]]"), this effect will not trigger.

  Each Rank 4 "Exosister" Xyz Monster has 3 effects:
  * A [[Continuous Effect]] that protects against monsters Special Summoned from the GY
  * A [[Quick Effect]] or [[Trigger Effect]] that is usable if the card was Xyz Summoned this turn using an "Exosister" monster as material
  * An [[Ignition Effect]] with a cost of detaching 1 material.

  The Rank 8 "[[Exosisters Magnifica]]" is the deck's ultimate boss monster, requiring 2 "Exosister" Rank 4 Xyz Monsters to summon, and cannot be summoned by "Exosister" 1-card-Xyz effects. It has potent board control and OTK effects, having double attack, Quick Effect (non-targeting) banish, and a Quick Effect to 1-card-Xyz one of its materials.

  "Exosister" Spell/Traps provide diverse removal, utility, and consistency options. "[[Exosister Pax|Pax]]" provides Spell Speed 2 searching and conditional special summoning. "[[Exosister Arment|Arment]]" provides a conditional Spell Speed 2 manual 1-card Xyz effect. "[[Exosister Carpedivem|Carpedivem]]" provides Continuous protection, conditional "[[Prohibition]]" effect, and S/T removal. "[[Exosister Vadis|Vadis]]" is a trap that special summons 2 "Exosister" monsters from Deck with return-to-deck restrictions, incentivizing the player to time the trap's activation correctly and immediately use the summoned monsters' effects to perform 1-card-Xyz summons. "[[Exosister Returnia|Returnia]]" provides targeted banish removal, and provides additional combo or removal if conditions are met.

  "Exosister" setup combos generally focus on swarming Level 4 monsters to set up disruptions, via the Spell/Traps searched by "[[Exosister Mikailis|Mikailis]]" and the on-field effects of "[[Exosisters Magnifica|Magnifica]]". "[[Exosister Martha|Martha]]", with its double summon effect, is key to the Level 4 swarming; it is searchable by "[[Exosister Kaspitell|Kaspitell]]", so summoning a single "Kaspitell" guarantees the full combo of summoning "Mikailis" and then "Magnifica". However, "Martha" imposes an extremely strict hard xenolocking condition.

  "[[Aratama]]" and "[[Sakitama]]" aid this deck's strategy by being Level 4 monsters that do not violate the lock enforced by "[[Exosister Martha]]", as they are never Special Summoned to the field. This offers easily-accessible materials for the creation of Rank 4 "Exosister" Xyz monsters.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "[[Exosister Martha]]" imposes an extremely restrictive [[List_of_unofficial_terms#Hard-lock|hard xenolocking]] condition; this greatly reduces the Deck's flexibility and makes the Deck's combos very predictable.
  * The Main Deck "Exosister" monsters all have extremely low ATK/DEF.
  * Mass monster removal cards such as "[[Raigeki]]" or "[[Dark Hole]]" can easily get rid of "Exosister" monsters due to them often lacking protection.
  * Since "Exosister" cards often placed restriction that prevented them from using most of non-handtrap interruption, the Deck is heavily reliant on "[[Exosister Returnia]]" and "[[Exosisters Magnifica]]" for interruption. Should "Magnifica" being removed in some way (such as being tributed to summon "[[Kaiju]]" monster), this can effectively shut down any of their interruptions.
  * "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" can also shut down any setup for "Exosister" monsters as all the "Exosister" Extra Deck monsters are Xyz monsters.
  * As all "Exosister" monsters are LIGHT-Attribute, "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]" can counter them from activating their effects.
