  "'''Memento'''" (メメント ''Memento'') is an [[archetype]] of various monsters with different [[Type]]s, [[Attribute]]s, and [[Level]]s introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Valiant Smashers]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#No. 04: Memento}}

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  "Memento" refers to an object kept as a reminder of a person, place, or event. It originates from the Latin ''mementō'', meaning "remember". The name may be a reference to the members being fossilized counterparts of classic monsters from the early ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game|OCG]]''. The "-tlan" string in the monster's names is derived from ''Mictlan'', the underworld in Aztec cosmology.

  The name may also allude to the Latin phrase ''mementō morī'' ("Remember you must die"), in reference to the skeletal appearances of the monsters.

  The archetype's Chinese name, "冥铭途", is a phono-semantic matching of "memento". It consists of the character 铭 (''Míng'', lit. "engrave", figuratively "epitaph") and the word "冥途" (''Míngtú'', lit. "underworld").

  === Members ===
  All monsters share the same [[Attribute]], [[Type]], [[Level]], [[ATK]], and [[DEF]] as their original counterparts.

  == Playing style ==
  "Memento" is a theme focused on speedily filling the [[Graveyard|GY]] with many copies of its monsters in order to facilitate the [[Special Summon]] of its boss monster; "[[Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation]]", which is able to attack all of the opponent's monsters once each when by itself on the field and Special Summons "Memento" monsters from the hand and GY when the opponent uses a card or effect. All "Memento" monsters, barring "Combined Creation", have effects that can [[Destroy|destroy]] a "Memento" monster(s) you control in order to do various other effects; from [[Searcher|searching]] cards to setting up the GY by sending monsters from the Deck to the GY for explosive plays with "Combined Creation". The two [[Level]] 1 monsters of the theme, "[[Mementotlan Goblin]]" and "[[Mementotlan Mace]]", also function as [[Hand trap]] cards while controlling "Combined Creation"; "Goblin" being able to prevent "Memento" monsters from being targeted with card effects for the turn while "Mace" is able to take control of an opponent's monster until the end of the turn.

  One simple method to [[Special Summon]] "Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation" requires only "[[Mementotlan Angwitch]]". When it is Summoned, it can add "[[Mementotlan Tatsunootoshigo]]" to the hand, which can Special Summon itself. Then, it can destroy itself to [[send]] "Mementotlan Mace", "Mementotlan Goblin", and a second copy of "Mementotlan Angwitch" from the Deck to the [[GY]]. Next, "Mementotlan Angwitch" can destroy itself to Summon "Mementotlan Goblin" from the GY, which can destroy itself to send "[[Mementotlan-Horned Dragon]]" and "Mementoral Tecuhtlica" from the Deck to the GY. Finally, "Mementoral Tecuhtlica" can Special Summon itself from the GY by shuffling "Fairywitch", "Tatsunootoshigo", "Mace", "Goblin", and "Horn Dragon" back into the Deck. If this combo is started by using "[[Mementotlan Dark Blade]]" to Summon "Mementotlan Angwitch" from the Deck, "Goblin" can send one of the archetype's [[Spell]]/[[Trap]] Cards instead.

  The backrow of the theme helps to further support this playing style as "[[Mementotlan Bone Party]]" is able to destroy a "Memento" monster in the [[Hand|hand]] or on the field to add another "Memento" monster to the hand Special Summon it to the field along with an additional GY effect to give a "Memento" monster [[Piercing]] for the turn. "[[Mementotlan Bone Back]]" serves as a tool to punish the opponent removing "Memento" from the field as it can freely summon a "Combined Creation" in response as well as banish itself when a "Memento" monster is removed from the GY by the opponent by Special Summoning as many "Memento" monsters from the hand or Deck with different names to the field. The [[Field Spell Card]], "[[Mementomictlan]]", gives further benefits to the theme as it gives "Memento" monsters the ability to prevent [[Spell Card|Spells]] and [[Trap Card|Traps]] from activating when they attack, targets a "Memento" monster that was destroyed to Special Summons a "Memento" monster from the GY with a lower level than the target, and the effect at the [[End Phase]] to [[Set|set]] a "Memento" Spell/Trap card from the GY to the field, opening to a control playstyle with the Trap Cards.

  The Trap Cards play further into the use of "Combined Creation" as a defensive threat as "[[Mementotlan Cranium Burst]]" forces the opponent to only attack the "Memento" monster with the highest ATK on your field and uses the stats of "Combined Creation" as fuel to [[Negate|negate]] monster effects once per chain at the cost of 1000 ATK and DEF from "Combined Creation". "[[S:P Little Knight]]" can be useful in combination with this strategy, as if it banishes "Combined Creation" until the end of the turn, "Combined Creation" will return with its full ATK on the next turn. In comparison, "[[Mementotlan Fracture Dance]]" is able to destroy cards on the field as well as reduce the stats of the opponent's monsters.

  If the deck wishes to use [[Synchro Monster]]s, "[[Xeno Meteorus]]" is an option due to its effect to special summon upon a card being destroyed by effect having synergy with the "Memento" strategy.

  === Sample combos ===
  "Memento" combos usually aim to Summon "[[Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation]]" and setup additional forms of interaction, either by the archetype's own cards ("[[Mementotlan Fracture Dance]]" and "[[Mementotlan Cranium Burst]]"), or by cards that take make use of the Deck's ability to create card advantage (i.e. "[[I:P Masquerena]]", "[[Guardian Chimera]]").

  One such combo aims to maximize the number of interruptions via [[destroy|destruction]] effects. It also setups the following:
  # Summon "[[Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation]]" to use "[[Mementotlan Cranium Burst]]" and "[[Mementotlan Mace]]" to both negate the opponent's monsters, as well as take control of one of them.
  # Destroy up to 5 of the opponent's cards by using "[[Mementomictlan Tecuhtlica - Creation King]]", "[[Mementotlan Fracture Dance]]" and "[[Mementotlan-Horned Dragon]]".
  # Prevent the opponent from attacking the player's other monsters with "Cranium Burst".
  # Create follow-up for the next turn by re-Summoning "[[Mementotlan Angwitch]]" with "Tecuhtlica" or "[[Mementomictlan]]".

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Mementotlan Dark Blade]]"
  | end     = "[[Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation]]", "[[Mementomictlan Tecuhtlica - Creation King]]", "[[Mementotlan-Horned Dragon]]", "[[Mementomictlan]]", "[[Mementotlan Cranium Burst]]", and "[[Mementotlan Fracture Dance]]" on the field + "[[Mementotlan Mace]]" in hand + "[[Mementotlan Angwitch]]" in GY
  | steps = 
  # Normal Summon "[[Mementotlan Dark Blade]]".
  # Activate "Dark Blade" to destroy itself and Special Summon "[[Mementotlan Angwitch]]" from the Deck.
  # Activate "Angwitch" to seach "[[Mementotlan Tatsunootoshigo]]".
  # Activate "Tatsunootoshigo" to Special Summon itself.
  # Activate "Tatsunootoshigo" to destroy itself and send "[[Mementotlan Shleepy]]", "[[Mementotlan Mace]]" and "[[Mementotlan Goblin]]" from the Deck to the GY.
  # Activate "Angwitch" to destroy itself and Summon "Mace" from the GY.
  # Activate "Mace" to destroy itself and search "[[Mementotlan Fusion]]".
  # Activate "Fusion" to Fusion Summon "[[Mementomictlan Tecuhtlica - Creation King]]" by shuffling "Dark Blade", "Tatsunootoshigo" and "Mace" from the GY into the Deck.
  # Activate "Creation King" to send another copy itself (from the Extra Deck), "[[Mementotlan Ghattic]]" and "[[Mementotlan Cranium Burst]]" from the Deck to the GY.
  # Activate "Ghattic" to Special Summon itself and add "Shleepy" from the GY to the hand.
  # Activate "Creation King" from the GY by banishing itself to search "[[Mementomictlan]]".
  # Activate "Mementomictlan".
  # Activate "Fusion" from the GY by banishing itself to destroy "Ghattic" and search "[[Mementotlan Fracture Dance]]".
  # Activate "Mementomictlan" to Special Summon "Goblin" from the GY.
  # Activate "Shleepy" from the hand to Special Summon itself and Fusion Summon "[[Mementotlan Twin Dragon]]" by using itself and "Goblin".
  # Activate "Twin Dragon" to destroy itself and search "[[Mementotlan-Horned Dragon]]" and "Mace", and also Special Summon "Goblin" from the GY.
  # Activate "Goblin" to destroy itself and send "[[Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation]]" and "Dark Blade" from the Deck to the GY.
  # Special Summon "Horned Dragon" from the hand via its own procedure.
  # Special Summon "Combined Creation" from the GY by shuffling "Twin Dragon", "Ghattic", "Shleepy", "Goblin", and "Dark Blade" from the GY into the Decks.
  # Set "Fracture Dance".
  # During the End Phase, activate "Mementomictlan" to set "Cranium Burst" from the GY.
  }}

  Another possible combo makes use of the Deck's swarming capabilities to use generic Extra Deck options, as well as the archetype's own methods of disruption. Compared to the previous combo, this one replaces the 5 possible destructions with "[[I:P Masquerena]]" (and "Angwitch" on the field) to [[Link Summon]] either "[[S:P Little Knight]]" or "[[Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess]]" (using a monster that "Mace" took control of) during the opponent's turn, while also preventing it from being destroyed by card effects.

  | opening = "[[Mementotlan Dark Blade]]"
  | end     = "[[Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation]]", "[[Mementotlan Cranium Burst]]", "[[Mementomictlan]]", "[[I:P Masquerena]]", and "[[Mementotlan Angwitch]]" on the field + "[[Mementotlan Mace]]" in hand
  | steps = 
  # Normal Summon "[[Mementotlan Dark Blade]]".
  # Activate "Dark Blade" to destroy itself and Special Summon "[[Mementotlan Angwitch]]" from the Deck.
  # Activate "Angwitch" to seach "[[Mementotlan Tatsunootoshigo]]".
  # Activate "Tatsunootoshigo" to Special Summon itself.
  # Activate "Tatsunootoshigo" to destroy itself and send "[[Mementotlan Ghattic]]", "[[Mementotlan Mace]]" and "[[Mementotlan Goblin]]" from the Deck to the GY.
  # Activate "Ghattic" to Special Summon itself.
  # Activate "Ghattic" to return "Tatsunootoshigo" from GY to hand.
  # Activate "Angwitch" to destroy "Ghattic" and Summon "Mace" from the GY.
  # Activate "Mace" to destroy itself and search "[[Mementotlan Fusion]]".
  # Activate "Fusion" to Fusion Summon "[[Mementotlan Twin Dragon]]" by shuffling "Dark Blade" and "Mace" from the GY into the Deck.
  # Activate "Twin Dragon" to destroy "Tatsunootoshigo" and search "[[Mementotlan-Horned Dragon]]" and "Mementotlan Mace".
  # Special Summon "Horned Dragon" from the hand with its own procedure.
  # Activate "Fusion" from the GY by banishing itself to destroy "Twin Dragon" and search "[[Mementomictlan]]".
  # Activate "Twin Dragon" to Special Summon "Goblin" from the GY.
  # Activate "Mementomictlan".
  # Activate "Goblin" to destroy "Horned Dragon" and send "[[Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation]]" and "[[Mementotlan Cranium Burst]]" from the Deck to the GY.
  # Activate "Mementomictlan" to Special Summon any "Memento" monster from the GY.
  # Link Summon "[[I:P Masquerena]]" by using that monster and "Goblin".
  # Special Summon "Tecuhtlica" with its own procedure by shuffling "Ghattic", "Mace", "Horned Dragon", "Twin Dragon" and "Tatsunootoshigo" from the GY into the Decks.
  # During the End Phase, activate "Mementomictlan" to set "Cranium Burst" from the GY.
