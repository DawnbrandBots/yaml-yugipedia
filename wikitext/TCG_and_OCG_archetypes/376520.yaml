  "'''Edge Imp'''" (エッジインプ ''Ejji Inpu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Sora Perse]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''.

  == Design ==
  They visually appear to be strange creatures made up of objects used for cutting or breaking, like scissors and tomahawks, with two glowing pink eyes within a shadowed area. According to Sora's [[Summon chant]]s, the "Edge Imps" are objects possessed by demons, which could explain the menacing appearance of the "[[Frightfur]]" monsters, and their conversion into [[DARK]] monsters. In the ''TCG'' and English ''ARC-V'' anime, their blades are given a glow to avoid references to real life bladed weapons.

  == Playing style ==
  {{Main|""Fluffal""}}
  "Edge Imp" monsters work in tandem with the "[[Fluffal]]" archetype, being part of the Fusion Materials for their "Frightfur" [[Fusion Monster]]s. As such, "Edge Imp" monsters focus on getting themselves into the hand or onto the field to be used for Fusion Summons, as well as gathering more materials through drawing cards.
