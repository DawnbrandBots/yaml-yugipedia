  "'''Fire Fist'''", known as "'''Flame Star'''" ({{Ruby|炎|えん}}{{Ruby|星|せい}} ''Ensei'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Beast-Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They are played by [[Shota Geki]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL|Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL]]'' manga.

  In the ''OCG'', every "Fire Fist" monster (except "Eagle", "Horse Prince", "Lion Emperor" and "Spirit") is named after the 108 heroes of ''[[wikipedia:Water Margin|Water Margin]]'', the "''108 Stars of Destiny''", mixed with names of animals. "Eagle", "Horse Prince", "Lion Emperor", and "Spirit" are characters from the novel, while the "[[Fire Formation]]" [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s are named after celestials.

  As seen in the artworks, every "Fire Fist" monster has a flame which represents a monster/animal form, except "[[Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Spirit|Spirit]]" who is a flame. They can be seen in pairs in the "Fire Formation" cards.

  "Fire Fist" monsters debuted in the ''OCG'' as promotional cards in various magazines. The first retail set to include "Fire Fist" cards was ''[[Cosmo Blazer]]''.

  == Members ==
  Currently only twenty-four of the "108 Stars of Destiny" and four other characters have been released as cards in the ''OCG''. Roughly a third of the heroes, the "Heavenly Spirits" and "Earthly Fiends" have been released.

  == Playing style ==
  The first three "Fire Fist" Monsters focus on Summoning [[Level]] 3 FIRE Monsters, though they also have drawbacks. Their [[effect]]s also indirectly [[support]] each other, making their respective Summons easier.

  The monsters introduced in ''Cosmo Blazer'' have swarming effects initiated by sending "Fire Formation" Spell/Trap cards to the [[Graveyard]]. But the support released in ''Lord of the Tachyon Galaxy'' have effects that initiate by sending not only "Fire Formation" Spell/Trap cards but "Fire Fist" Monsters as well and their effects interact both the Hand and Graveyard. And the support released in ''Judgment of the Light'' have effects to Special Summon "Fire Fist" Monsters from the Deck and setting "Fire Formation" Spell cards when they are destroyed by battle ("Boar") or by card effects ("Caribou").

  One of the most effective ways to play with a "Fire Fist" Deck is using the Level 4 "Fire Fist" monsters and the "Fire Formation" Spells to Xyz Summon Rank 4 monsters. Using "[[Fire Formation - Tenki]]" to search for Monsters such as "[[Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Gorilla]]" or "[[Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Bear]]", you can use them to destroy one of your opponent's cards, depending on which monster you added to your hand. Then, if "[[Fire Formation - Tensu]]" is in your hand with another Level 4 Beast-Warrior, use them to Xyz Summon a Rank 4. Another method can be through "[[Coach Soldier Wolfbark]]" when any of the "Fire Formation" Spells are available. Because the main focus of this version of the deck is focused on Rank 4 Xyz Monsters, Level 3 Monsters are not necessary, though in emergency cases, "[[Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Raven]]" is probably the only Level 3 "Fire Fist" Monster necessary. Other support can include staples, "Fire Formation" Traps for supporting Beast-Warriors, "[[Reborn Tengu]]" for more Xyz Materials, "[[Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Snake]]" for some draw power, and "[[Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Dragon]]" for Special Summoning "Fire Fists" like "Gorilla" and "Bear" to help destroy one of your opponent's cards.

  This build of the Deck focuses primarily on summoning the Synchro monster "Horse Prince" by using the Tuner, "Spirit", to resurrect "Leopard" or "Rooster", then use its effect to add another "Fire Fist" Monster to your hand, and his effect to set another "Fire Formation" Spell/Trap from your Deck (If you summoned him by via "Spirit"). Or, you can use "Fire Formation - Tensu" to Summon a "Raven" after Normal Summoning "Spirit", whom will let you set a "Fire Formation" Spell/Trap from your Deck when Synchro Summoned into "Horse Prince". But keep in mind, if you decide to set a Spell/Trap and summoned "Rooster" with the effect of "Horse Prince", "Rooster" will lose timing and you cannot search.

  With the release of their second Tuner, "Boar", you can also add in your normal Level 4 Fire Fist monsters, "Bear", "Gorilla" and "Dragon", to keep control of your opponent's cards and be able to Special Summon more "Fire Fist" Monsters while also being able to Synchro Summon into Level 8's. "Boar" can Synchro Summon into either "Kirin", "[[Crimson Blader]]" or "[[Black Rose Dragon]]". "Kirin" allows you to Set another "Fire Formation" Spell/Trap card from your Deck when Synchro Summoned.

  Running the Level 4's and Level 3's also still gives you the option of Xyz Summoning into "Lion Emperor", "Tiger King" and "Cardinal", if you choose.
