  "'''Fluffal'''" , known as "'''Furnimal'''" (ファーニマル ''Fānimaru'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Fairy]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Sora Perse]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|manga]].

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  The art design of "Fluffal" monsters are based off of plush toys with the addition of angel-like wings. The wings typically appear on their backs, except for "[[Fluffal Owl]]", who has them on its head, "[[Fluffal Penguin]]" who sports them as a bow-tie, and "[[Fluffal Wings]]", who is itself a pair of wings). The angel-like wings give Fluffal monsters a cute and innocent appearance that contrasts with the demonic-toy appearance of their "[[Frightfur]]" Fusion counterparts.

  === Etymology ===
  "Fluffal" is a portmanteau of "fluff" and "animal". Their Japanese archetype name, "Furnimal," is likewise a portmanteau of "fur" and "animal". Their names tend to be their archetype name followed by a species of animal.

  == Playing style ==
  The Fluffal archetype focuses primarily on [[Fusion Summon]]ing tactics to search out and recycle "[[Polymerization]]" while also utilizing cards such as "[[Edge Imp Sabres]]" and "[[Toy Vendor]]" along with "[[Fluffal Dog]]" to give the player easy access to the necessary cards to Fusion Summon "[[Frightfur]]" [[Fusion Monster]]s. Since Fusion Summoning requires a large amount of cards, several Fluffal monsters such as "[[Fluffal Dog]]" and "[[Fluffal Wings]]" help to quickly gain card advantage, and cards such as "[[Fluffal Cat]]" and "[[Fluffal Rabbit]]" help to recycle the necessary cards after being used as [[Fusion Material Monster]]s.

  "[[Frightfur]]" monsters can be Fusion Summoned using "[[Edge Imp]]" monsters as [[Fusion Material]]. Frightfur monsters rely primarily on "Fluffal" archetype with boosting effects. They also have offensive effects that either boosts their [[ATK]] or grants additional attacks (e.g., "[[Frightfur Bear]]", "[[Frightfur Sabre-Tooth]]", "[[Frightfur Wolf]]", and "[[Frightfur Tiger]]"), destroys cards on the opponent's field ("[[Frightfur Tiger]]" and "[[Frightfur Leo]]"), prevents the opponent from activating cards or effects when they attack ("[[Frightfur Chimera]]" and "[[Frightfur Sheep]]"), or steals an opponent's monster by equipping them to themselves or Special Summons them to their controller's field ("[[Frightfur Bear]]" and "[[Frightfur Chimera]]").

  Frightfur monsters have a small weakness in having specific "Edge Imp" monsters for Fusion Materials (outside of "Chimera"). However, cards like "[[Fusion Reserve]]" and "[[Fusion Conscription]]" can help obtain needed "Edge Imps" in hand, and "[[Fluffal Sheep]]" can help recycle both Edge Imp and Fluffal monsters.  Each of the five "Edge Imps" possesses helpful abilities of their own: "[[Edge Imp Chain]]" searches for "Frightfur" Spell and Trap supports whenever it hits the Graveyard, "[[Edge Imp Saw]]" provides extra draw power, and "[[Edge Imp Tomahawk]]" can substitute for any of the other "Edge Imp" monsters if they are not available in hand or field.

  However, Frightfur Decks do not synergize well with many popular archetype cards, as they cannot be fused with, and the other Summoning methods are not nearly as important as your own Fusion Summoning. But a notable synergy lies with "[[Lilith, Lady of Lament]]" for a disruptive play: Lilith, Lady of Lament can search for "[[Necro Fusion]]" by tributing itself, thus enabling you to summon "[[Frightfur Tiger]]" on the opponent's turn and destroy as many cards as "Fluffal" Fusion Materials were used for its Fusion Summon. "Lilith" herself can be Special Summoned from the deck with the Pendulum Effect of "[[Frightfur Meister]]" by tributing "[[Edge Imp Sabres]]".
  Further non-archetypal support includes [[Link Monster]]s "[[Predaplant Verte Anaconda]]", "[[Cross-Sheep]]", and "[[Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * In general, "Frightfur" monsters are vulnerable to Fusion Monster Anti-Support cards.
  * For example, "Fluffals" rely on Fusion Summoning to be effective, so cards that stop the use of "[[Polymerization]]" or "[[Frightfur Fusion]]" such as "[[Prohibition]]", "[[Psi-Blocker]]", "[[Armageddon Designator]]", "[[Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell]]", etc., will shut them down.
  ** To an extent, cards that prohibit Special Summoning, such as "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]", will slow down Fluffal decks, though Synchro- or Xyz-centric decks can use "[[Non-Fusion Area]]" to help with this problem.
  * The archetype as a whole is effect-heavy, permitting cards like "[[Face-Off]]" (to counter "[[Fluffal Leo]]"), "Skill Drain", "Soul Drain", "[[Skull Meister]]", and "[[Effect Veiler]]" to take advantage.
  * Cards that have banishing effects such as "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]" or that prevent banished monsters (such as "[[Necrovalley]]") can also prevent "Frightfur" monsters from being easily summoned.
