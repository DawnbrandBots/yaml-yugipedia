  "'''Six Samurai'''", known as "'''Six Warmen'''" ({{Ruby|六|ろく}}{{Ruby|武|ぶ}}{{Ruby|衆|しゅう}} ''Rokubushū'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Strike of Neos]]''. It includes a sub-archetype, "[[Secret Six Samurai]]" as well as a [[series]], "[[Legendary Six Samurai]]". The archetype also receives implicit support from the "[[Shien]]" and "[[Six Strike]]" archetypes.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|Master Guide 2 card storylines#File No. 05: The True Samurai Who Ride Across the Battlefield|Master Guide 3 card storylines#File Number 03: Legendary Six Samurai|Master Duel card storylines#Indomitable Warriors of Unwavering Loyalty}}

  ==Design==
  The overall theme of "Six Samurai" is a futuristic feudal Japan setting, combined with supernatural elements.

  Another common theme is there are different monsters belonging to a different Attribute for each reincarnation of "Six Samurai": "The Six Samurai", "[[Legendary Six Samurai]]" and the recent "[[Secret Six Samurai]]".

  The crest of "Secret Six Samurai" features kunai-like details, a reference to the kagemusha.

  ==Members==
  The main members of the "Six Samurai" archetype can be divided into four primary sub-series of monsters: "The Six Samurai", "[[Legendary Six Samurai]]", the old counterparts of the Legendary Six Samurai, and "[[Secret Six Samurai]]".

  ==Playing style==
  "Six Samurai" is a combo Deck reliant on constantly swarming the field with monsters, thus building up counters with "[[Gateway of the Six]]" to use its non [[once per turn]] effect. Uninterrupted, it can make near-unbreakable boards or outright [[FTK]].

  Originally a high monster-count [[aggro]] Deck, the release of ''[[Storm of Ragnarok]]'' shifted it into a combo Deck, with "[[Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En]]" acting as a strong endboard piece (especially for the time), and various searchers ("[[Shien's Smoke Signal]]", "[[Reinforcement of the Army]]", and "[[Gateway of the Six]]") enabling higher consistency.

  === Cards ===
  Their monsters can be split into 3 main groups:
  * The original Six Samurai monsters debuted in ''[[Strike of Neos]]'' and depended on having another "Six Samurai" on the field to activate their effects. They also all shared the effect of ''"If this card would be destroyed you can destroy another "Six Samurai" monster you control instead"''.
  * ''[[Storm of Ragnarok]]'' introduced the "[[Legendary Six Samurai]]" series, providing further support for the original Six, as well as support for summoning their own [[Synchro Monster]], "[[Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En]]".
  * ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Spirit Warriors]]'' introduced the new "Secret Six Samurai" sub-archetype, as well as the first "Six Samurai" [[Fusion Monster]], "[[Secret Six Samurai - Rihan]]". These "Six Samurai" have various effects focused on banished "Six Samurai" monsters, as well as banishing themselves to protect "Six Samurai" monsters on the field.

  Their [[Link Monster]], "[[Battle Shogun of the Six Samurai]]", enables consistent searching of "Gateway of the Six" - this allows the deck to focus more on controlled infinite loops, as described below.

  Also, ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]'' introduced general support to their consistency and endboards, with ways to search "Six Strike" and "Six Samurai" Quick-Plays, while "[[Legendary Lord Six Samurai - Shi En]]" can protect plays from handtraps early into the combo.

  In the ''OCG'', Warrior support like "[[Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights]]" and "[[M-X-Saber Invoker]]" are good tools to have.

  ===Infinite Loops===
  "[[Gateway of the Six]]" defined "Six Samurai" as a Deck capable of creating [[controlled loop|controlled infinite loops]]; "[[Legendary Six Samurai - Mizuho]]" and "[[Legendary Six Samurai - Shinai]]" can be summon themselves indefinitely, enabling counters for either "Gateway of the Six" effect. This enables the archetype to rip cards with "[[Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]" and "[[PSY-Framelord Omega]]", or even FTK with cards like "[[Gagaga Cowboy]]".

  ====Red/Blue Infinite Advantage Loop====
  The main infinite loop for Six Samurai is the "Red/Blue Loop". This requires either 2 of either [[Legendary Six Samurai - Mizuho]] or [[Legendary Six Samurai - Shinai]], 1 of the other, along with "[[Gateway of the Six]]" with 4+ counters on it. 

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = 2 of either [[Legendary Six Samurai - Mizuho]] or [[Legendary Six Samurai - Shinai]] on field, 1 of the other, "[[Gateway of the Six]]" with 4 counters. 
  | end     = Identical start point, but you have Summoned 2 more "Six Samurai" monsters this turn.
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "Mizuho's" effect to destroy itself, Tributing "Shinai" for cost.
  # In the [[GY]], activate "Shinai's" mandatory effect, adding "Mizuho" to hand.
  # Activate "Gateway's" 4 counter effect to add "Shinai".
  # Special Summon "Mizuho" and "Shinai", which adds 4 counters to "Gateway".
  }}

  This loop doesn't make any progress on its own, but if there is another card generating Bushido Counters, the loop generates counters that can be used for "Gateway". Alternatively, if the opponent has used "[[Mulcharmy Purulia]]" (or "[[Maxx "C"]]" in the ''OCG''), this loop can deck out the opponent.

  ====Ama-Shogun Infinite Destruction Loop====
  * The purpose of this loop is finding the easiest way possible to infinitely destroy either your opponent's cards or your own. This is mostly for the purpose of getting your own cards in GY to use later. In the first repetition, you'll likely Tribute your second "Mizuho".
  ** (Assuming the Red/Blue Loop has already been utilized): Tribute another "Six Samurai" monster (Always leave a "Shinai" on field while looping), target the desired card and destroy it. Add back cards used from loop with "Gateway". Link Summon "Battle Shogun". Special Summon back "Mizuho" when you wish to destroy another card, Tribute your "Battle Shogun" in these later repetitions.

  ====RBG Infinite Recursion Loop====
  * In the ''OCG'' where "[[Daigusto Emeral]]" is Unlimited, this loop is unnecessary. '''Two''' copies of "Emeral" should be used instead to keep returning the other from GY to the Extra Deck. This is a continuation of the Red/Blue loop to keep returning cards from GY using either the GY effect of "[[PSY-Framelord Omega]]". One key component of this loop is getting a "[[Shien]]" Tuner like "[[Shien's Squire]]" in play with cards like "[[Shien's Dojo|Dojo]]", "[[Crystron Halqifibrax]]" or "[[Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion]]".
  ** (Assuming the Red/Blue Loop has already been utilized): Special Summon "PSY-Framelord Omega" with "Kizan", "Mizuho", and "Squire". Destroy "Omega" with the Ama-Shogun Loop above. Activate "Omega's" effect to shuffle into the Deck both itself and one other card in the GY.
  ** The usage of a Warrior Link-2 and Link-3 that can both accept generic materials (such as "[[Ferocious Flame Swordsman]]" and "[[Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos]]") can facilitate a version of this loop as well. Ensuring you have enough Counters and an extra Six Samurai monster ("Shinai" or "Mizuho" is a good choice because it can facilitate its counterpart as well as "Kizan"), summon "Battle Shogun" and the monster you wish to loop. Summon a "Kizan", "Mizuho", or "Shinai" as appropriate and exhaust the counters on Battle Shogun. Link Battle Shogun and the loop card into "Ferocious Flame Swordsman". Use "Ferocious Flame Swordsman" and the summoned Six Samurai monster to summon another copy of "Battle Shogun". Summon "Daigusto" and trigger its effect by targeting "Battle Shogun", "Ferocious Flame Swordsman", and the loop card. Summon the loop card again and another Six Samurai monster as done previously. Link "Battle Shogun", "Daigusto", and the loop card into "Black Luster Soldier". Link "Black Luster Soldier" and the Six Samurai monster into a copy of "Battle Shogun". Summon the second copy of "Daigusto" and target "Black Luster Soldier", "Daigusto", and the loop card. Reclaim Battle Shogun as necessary using "Gateway". Continue this loop from the step where the loop card was summoned a second time. If counters get low, use the Red-Blue loop above to gather resources as appropriate.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Like many [[FTK]] Decks, it can struggle going second. Because the archetype tends to rely on 2-card combos ("Six Samurai" monsters can Special Summon themselves if controlling another "Six Samurai"), it can't run as much non-engine as contemporary decks.
  * Key chokepoints are "[[Battle Shogun of the Six Samurai]]" or removing "[[Gateway of the Six]]", and in the ''OCG'', "[[Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights]]".
  * "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" is often effective due to the Deck's heavy reliance on searching.
  * "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" is a major struggle to the Deck due to its reliance on Special Summoning, though it can be countered by Summoning "[[Legendary Lord Six Samurai - Shi En]]" before the 5th summon.

  ==Trivia==
  *Each Six Samurai has a different attribute, and those with polar attributes have opposite effects. [[The Six Samurai - Yaichi|Yaichi's]] opposite is [[The Six Samurai - Kamon|Kamon]], [[The Six Samurai - Nisashi|Nisashi's]] is [[The Six Samurai - Yariza|Yariza]], and [[The Six Samurai - Irou|Irou's]] is [[The Six Samurai - Zanji|Zanji]].
  **Yaichi destroys face-down Spell/Trap cards, and Kamon destroys face-up Spell/Trap cards.
  **Nisashi can attack twice and potentially destroy multiple monsters, while Yariza bypasses monsters entirely to attack directly.
  **Irou's effect can take down monsters before they become a threat, and Zanji's effect can take out an already active threat.
  *The Legendary Six Samurai have similar interactions between opposing attributes:
  **"[[Legendary Six Samurai - Shi En|Shi En]]" takes care of Spells and Traps, while "[[Legendary Six Samurai - Enishi|Enishi]]" gets rid of monsters once per turn. Both effects can be activated during either player's turn.
  **"[[Legendary Six Samurai - Kizan|Kizan]]" can summon itself if you have a different "Six Samurai" monster, while "[[Legendary Six Samurai - Kageki|Kageki]]" summons another "Six Samurai" when Normal Summoned.
  **"[[Legendary Six Samurai - Mizuho|Mizuho]]" requires "Six Samurai" to be tributed to activate its effect that destroys cards. On the other hand, "[[Legendary Six Samurai - Shinai|Shinai]]" need to ''be'' tributed to get a "Six Samurai" from the Graveyard (also, you can Special Summon one while controlling the other).
  *Most card artworks featuring the Six Samurai and their supporting cards contain a heraldic crest/coat of arms (紋章 - monshō or 家紋 - kamon) representing the Six Samurai. The crest is composed of a bolded outer-circle and an inner-circle. The inner-circle contains six smaller dotted circles which are connected to each other (in a specific path) and 6 other irregular shapes that are likely to represent the initial Six Samurai. To date, the only Six Samurai related cards that ''do not'' feature the Six Samurai crest are "[[Great Shogun Shien]]", "[[Tenkabito Shien]]", "[[Shien's Footsoldier]]", "[[Shien's Daredevil]]", and "[[Shien's Castle of Mist]]". However, it appears that if you look at the art in some of the Shien cards that Shien and Elder have an alternate symbol between them, as evident in "[[Tenkabito Shien]]", "[[Shien's Advisor]]", "[[Elder of the Six Samurai]]", and even "[[Shien's Smoke Signal]]".
  *The name of the archetype and the design of their members, including the "[[Shien]]" archetype, may be derived from the Japanese films ''[[wikipedia:Seven Samurai|Seven Samurai]]'' (1954) and ''[[wikipedia:Kagemusha|Kagemusha]]'' (1980), both by [[wikipedia:Akira Kurosawa|Akira Kurosawa]].
