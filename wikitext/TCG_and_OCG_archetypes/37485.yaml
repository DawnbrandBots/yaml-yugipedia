  "'''Spirit Message'''", named "'''Death Message'''" ({{ruby|死|し}}のメッセージ ''Shi no Messēji'') in Japanese is an [[archetype]] used by "[[Destiny Board]]" as part of its [[victory condition]]. The player who gathers all five letters on the field wins the Duel. In the manga and all Japanese appearances, the word spelled out is the English word "DEATH"; in all other versions, the word spelled out is the English word "FINAL".

  ==Differences in media==
  In the manga, "[[Destiny Board]]" can only be activated while "[[Dark Necrofear]]" is in the [[Graveyard]]. Instead of playing a "Spirit Message" Spell Card each turn, the board simply creates a letter. However, if "Dark Necrofear" is removed from the Graveyard, then the Ouija board breaks.

  In the manga, the one who controls the Ouija board is a spiritual form of "Dark Necrofear". In the anime, it was her dismembered hand.

  == Playing style ==
  The weakness of "Destiny Board" is that if "Destiny Board" or a "Spirit Message" card [[leaves the field]], any "Destiny Board" and all "Spirit Message" cards that card's controller [[control]]s are sent to the [[Graveyard]].

  Another is that "Destiny Board" and the "Spirit Message" cards each occupies a [[Spell & Trap Zone]], limiting the player's use of Spell and Trap Cards. If another Spell/Trap Card is occupying one of the Zones, the message cannot be completed and the player cannot use any Spell or Trap Cards. "[[Dark Sanctuary]]" allows the "Spirit Messages" to be treated as monsters and provides protection to them, so you can use other Spells or Traps as support until you win.

  Stall cards are essential for this Deck so that the opponent can't do anything but try to destroy "Destiny Board".

  ===Herald Spirit Message===
  "[[Herald of Perfection]]" and "[[Herald of Ultimateness]]" can be used to protect the "Destiny Board" and the "Spirit Message" cards without occupying your [[Spell & Trap Zone]]s. "[[Good Goblin Housekeeping]]" can be used to quickly draw "Destiny Board" while also returning "Spirit Messages" to your Deck.

  ==Trivia==
  * This is the oldest [[archetype]] in the ''TCG''/''OCG'', as "[[Destiny Board]]" (from Japanese ''[[Labyrinth of Nightmare (Japanese)|Labyrinth of Nightmare]]'') was the first card to interact with a specific name string.
  ** Though members of other archetypes such as "[[Archfiend]]", "[[Dark Magician (archetype)|Dark Magician]]", "[[Blue-Eyes]]", and "[[Forbidden One]]" were already released in earlier sets, those archetypes did not receive support until much later.
  * In video games such as ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Tag Force]]'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel]]'', "[[Dark Necrofear]]" appears to spell the message of "Destiny Board" after all the "Spirit Message" cards are gathered, refering how "Destiny Board" worked in the manga.
