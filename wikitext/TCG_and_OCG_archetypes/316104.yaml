  "'''Frightfur'''", known as "'''Death-Toy'''" (デストーイ ''Desutōi'') in the ''OCG'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Fiend]] [[Fusion Monster]]s used by [[Sora Perse]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. Most members of this archetype are [[DARK]] monsters, with the exception of the [[WATER]] "[[Frightfur Kraken]]" and "[[Frightfur Cruel Whale]]". The "Frightfur" monsters serve as "bosses" for both the "[[Edge Imp]]" and "[[Fluffal]]" archetypes since the [[Fusion Material]]s used for their [[Fusion Summon]] reside in these archetypes.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  [[File:Frightfuranime.png|200px|left|thumb|"[[Frightfur Bear (anime)|Frightfur Bear]]", "[[Frightfur Leo (anime)|Frightfur Leo]]" and "[[Frightfur Sheep (anime)|Frightfur Sheep]]".]]
  "Frightfur" monsters are based off of corrupted versions of animals from "[[Fluffal]]" archetype. They feature a destroyed plush toy that was re-fabricated with their respective "[[Edge Imp]]" tools or weapons inside them, giving them a more demonic and terrifying appearance, in contrast to the "Fluffal" monsters. The artwork of "[[Frightfur Factory]]" depicts the transformation of "Fluffal" to "Frightfur" monsters. In the ''TCG'' and English ''ARC-V'' anime, the blades of the "Frightfur" monsters are given a glow to avoid references to actual weapons.

  === Etymology ===
  "Frightfur" is a pun on "frightful" and "fur". Their Japanese name "Death-Toy" directly describes their menacing appearances, and can also be a pun on "destroy".
