  "'''Artmage'''", known as "'''Artmegia'''" (アルトメギア ''Arutomegia'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[LIGHT]] monsters introduced in ''[[Duelist's Advance]]''. It revolves around "[[Medius the Pure]]", [[Fusion Summon]]ing, and controlling multiple monster [[Type]]s. It is connected to the "[[Power Patron]]", "[[DoomZ]]", and "[[Elfnote]]" archetypes through the lore surrounding "Medius the Pure".

  ==Lore==
  "[[Power Patron]]s" are higher beings living in the Spiritual World that is cut off from the Real World. In an era of chaos brought about by various nations vying for supremacy, there was one powerful nation that prospered with the power of the "Power Patron": "[[Artmage Academic Arcane Arts Acropolis]]". It is an Academy City State that won the war against other nations with the power of "[[Nerva the Power Patron of Creation]]", who is one of the Gods of the Spiritual World. The academy, which was created for students to compete against each other learning "Armagi", drawing its magic power from "Nerva", eventually became a nation.

  "[[Medius the Pure]]" is a being who holds the destiny of "Artmage" in his hands with his power of "Future Prophecy". "Nerva" is the "Power Patron" who supplies magic power to "Artmage". "[[Artmage Diactorus]]" is "Medius" who has inherited the power of "Nerva".

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  "Artmage" and "Artmegia" appear to be portmanteaus of "art", "media", and "mage".
