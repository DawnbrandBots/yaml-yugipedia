  {{Quote|The Timelords: they're given life from an [[Infinite Machine|infinite]] term. They [[wikipedia:Sefirot|intertwine with one another]] and consist of ten god-like cards and the [[Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord|Almighty God of Gods]].|source=[[Z-one]] on the "Timelords"}}
  "'''Timelord'''", known as "'''Time Machine God'''" ({{Ruby|時|じ}}{{Ruby|械|かい}}{{Ruby|神|しん}} ''Jikaishin'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an archetype consists of [[Level]] 10 [[Fairy]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Z-one]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime. [[Eve]] also uses a member of this archetype in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' manga, the [[Synchro Monster]] "[[Timelord Progenitor Vorpgate]]".

  ==Design==
  <div style="float:right;">[[File:Timelord Tree Of Life.png|thumb|190px|The Tree of Life and the Timelords]]</div>
  [[File:Timelord Lineart.jpg|thumb|left|Lineart]]

  The first ten "Timelord" monsters are based on the [[wikipedia:Sefirot|sefirah]], the ten attributes of emanation of the [[wikipedia:Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]], the mystic symbol used in the [[wikipedia:Kabbalah|Jewish Kabbalah]]. They are also named after the [[wikipedia:archangel|archangel]] that corresponds with their respective sefirot. The eleventh member, "[[Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord]]", is named after the sefirot itself, representing the mystical state where all ten sefirah become one, [[wikipedia:Da'at|Da'at]], and God.

  "[[Timelord Progenitor Vorpgate]]" is separate from the first ten "Timelords" and "Sephylon", as it originates from the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V'' manga, instead. It is named after the [[wikipedia:Vulgate|Vulgate]], a late-4th-century Latin translation of the Bible, instead of an archangel.

  Each "Timelord" monster is depicted as a metallic suit of armor resembling an angelic figure, with a color scheme corresponding with the color of their respective [[Attribute]]. The armor features a large chest piece with a screen, depicting a human-like figure from the neck upwards (most likely the angelic beings controlling the armor), wearing a unique headpiece. Some of the members' screens feature an extreme close-up of the human-like faces.

  ===Members===
  The first ten "Timelords" share the following [[Monster effect|effects]]:
  * ''Cannot be [[Special Summon]]ed from the [[Main Deck|Deck]].''
  * ''If you control no [[Monster Card|monsters]], you can [[Normal Summon]] this card without [[Tribute|Tributing]].''
  ** For "[[Sandaion, the Timelord]]" only, this is instead ''If only your opponent controls a monster, you can Normal Summon this card without Tributing.''
  * ''Cannot be [[destroyed by battle]] or [[card effect]]s.''
  * ''You take no [[battle damage]] from [[attack]]s involving this card.''
  ** For "[[Metaion, the Timelord]]", and all "Timelord" monsters in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 6]]'', this effect only applies if the monster is in [[Attack Position]].
  ** "[[Sandaion, the Timelord]]" instead prevents either player from taking battle damage from attacks involving it.
  * ''At the end of the [[Battle Phase]], if this card [[battle]]d: [Unique effect].''
  ** For "[[Timelord Progenitor Vorpgate]]" and "[[Raphion, the Timelord (Tag Force 6)]]" only, this effect [[activate]]s at the end of the [[Damage Step]].
  * ''[[Once per turn]], during your [[Standby Phase]]: [[Shuffle]] this card into the Deck.''
  * Additionally, "[[Lazion, the Timelord]]" and "[[Zaphion, the Timelord]]" have additional unique effects that are not dependent on the Battle Phase.

  ==Playing style==
  "Timelord" [[Monster Card|monsters]] have a [[Stall]] and [[Burn Deck|Burn]] playstyle. They protect the player from [[battle damage]], while their other [[Card effect|effects]] slowly [[Effect damage|damage]] the opponent. As they do not need to rely on [[Special Summon]]s, many [[anti-meta]] cards can be used with them.
  An [[OTK]] is possible by Normal Summoning "[[Sandaion, the Timelord]]" and Special Summoning "[[Michion, the Timelord]]" with "[[Celestial Transformation]]" (or vice-versa), attacking with "Michion" to halve the opponent's LP (8000 LP → 4000 LP) and "Sandaion" to inflict 2000 damage (4000 LP → 2000 LP), then Xyz Summon "[[Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max]]" and using its effect (2000 LP → 0 LP).

  ===Timelord Burn===
  In some specialized builds, "Timelord" Decks are played as a blind second [[Burn Deck|burn]] strategy using cards such as "[[Michion, the Timelord]]" and/or "[[Raphion, the Timelord]]" to quickly reduce the opponent's LP before finishing off with various burn cards that can be easily chained together, [[Continuous Trap Card]]s that can deal damage with certain actions of the opponent, or battle Traps that prevent the opponent from attacking.

  ===Weaknesses===
  While the "Timelords" cannot be destroyed, they are not unbeatable and can can still be [[banish]]ed or [[Tribute]]d. Their Summon can also be negated by a card like "[[Solemn Warning]]". To overcome these weaknesses, cards that protect against direct attacks can be useful.
  In addition, cards that can negate the effects of "Timelord" are extremely useful, as that will strip them of all their protection and leave the opponent with a 0 ATK monster that cannot do anything (however, this will be less useful against "Sandaion" and "Sephylon").
  Cards that can attack the opponent directly, such as "[[Earthbound Immortal]]" or "[[Toon]]" monsters can be very useful against "Timelord" monsters, as they can bypass their protection and effects and deal your opponent significant damage in the process.
  "Timelord" monsters rely on attacking for their effects to activate, so any number of basic [[stall]] cards that aim to block the opponent's attacks will stop them as well, including [[battle position]] changers. However, this weakness can be overcome by using cards that force the "Timelord" monster to be attacked.
  "Timelord" monsters are also especially weak against "[[Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon]]" because it banishes any monster that is not destroyed by it when it attacks. Since the "Timelord" is banished, its effect cannot trigger and it bypasses the "Timelord" non-destroyable effect via banishment.
  ==Trivia==
  * During his [[Turbo Duel]] with [[Yusei Fudo]], Z-one Summons the "Timelords" in the order of their corresponding Sefirot. In addition, he also attacks in this order when he controls multiple "Timelords".
  * In the anime, the "Timelords" have a [[Rare]] rarity, with the exception of "[[Sephylon, the Ultimate Timelord (anime)|Sephylon]]", which has an [[Ultra Rare]] rarity instead.
  ** As a reference to the anime rarity of "Timelord" monsters, all "Timelord" monsters except "Sephylon" and "[[Sandaion, the Timelord]]" were released in a [[Common]] or [[Rare]] rarity in the ''OCG'' version of ''[[Collectors Pack 2018]]'' and in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel]]''.
