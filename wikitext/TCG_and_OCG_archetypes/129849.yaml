  "'''Gem-Knight'''" (ジェムナイト ''Jemunaito'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] monsters that was released in ''[[Duel Terminal - Vylon Descends!!]]''. They are used by [[Julia Krystal]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime.

  All members of this archetype are named after different minerals. Aesthetically, they appear to be a synthesis of [[Jesse Anderson]]'s "[[Crystal Beast]]s" and [[Jaden Yuki]]'s "[[Elemental HERO]]" cards, possibly as an homage to their friendship in the anime. This is evidenced in cards such as "[[Gem-Knight Fusion]]", whose artwork is clearly a merging of "[[Crystal Release]]" and "[[Miracle Fusion]]".

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines|Master Guide 5 card storylines|Master Duel card storylines#The Pyroxene Warriors}}
  A group of warriors endowed with the power of minerals, the "Gem-Knights" value honor above all else and disapprove of battle for the sake of battle. At the provocation of the barbaric "[[Laval]]", however, they are forced to take up arms and protect the clans from their wanton destruction. However, the "[[Steelswarm]]" begin to invade the surface land, intending to take over. The Gem-Knights join up with the other clans in a temporary union spearheaded by the "[[Vylon]]s". Along the way, they obtain [[Gem-Knight Prismaura|new powers]] with which to resist the "Steelswarm". Although the "Steelswarm" are quickly dispatched, conflict is far from over. The "Vylons" decide to exterminate the clans in order to prevent future wars.

  The clans once more band together in order to halt the "Vylon", but it is the collaboration between the "Gem-Knights" and "[[Gishki]]" to whom credit for their eventual victory goes: "[[Gem-Knight Pearl]]" is the downfall of the "Vylon". After the "Vylons" are driven back, the alliances between clans once again dissolve.
  The "Gishki" immediately resume their invasion of "[[Mist Valley]]", which had been their main objective pre-"Steelswarm". In order to obtain resources from the Valley, the "Gishki" enact a genocide on the "[[Gusto]]". The Gem-Knights intervene to [[Daigusto Emeral|rescue the remaining]] "Gusto".

  When the "[[lswarm]]" virus begins to spread across the Duel Terminal world, the Gem-Knights join the "Gusto" in a prayer for the "[[Constellar]]," a legendary band of divine warriors, to aid them. The "Constellar" may not be strong enough to resist the "lswarm" army alone, as the "Gishki" clan falls to the virus. Knowing this, the "Gem-Knights" fuse into [[Gem-Knight Master Diamond|the most powerful Gem-Knight]].

  "[[Cairngorgon, Antiluminescent Knight]]" appears to be a corrupted combination (probably by the "[[lswarm]]" virus) of "Gem-Knight Crystal", with parts of "Gem-Knight Zirconia" (right arm and left leg), "Gem-Knight Master Diamond" (left arm and right leg), and "Gem-Knight Prismaura" (damaged head).

  Their team symbol is a jewel droplet adorned with gold trim and two small, arced points. Its color varies according to the monster or object to which it is attached.

  == Members ==
  All "Gem-Knight" monsters are [[EARTH]], whereas their [[Type]] varies between [[Pyro]], [[Thunder]], [[Aqua]], or [[Rock]] (representing the cardinal elements: fire, wind, water and earth, respectively), as well as a few [[Fairy]] monsters. Each Type includes a [[Normal Monster|Normal]] member, a [[Gemini monster|Gemini]] member, and a [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]] member.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Gem-Knight" archetype is based around [[Fusion Summon]]ing, accomplished with the use the archetype's many Fusion Summon-[[Spell]]s/[[Trap]]s and a wide array of recycling effects. The Deck has a secondary focus on gaining advantage from "[[Foolish Burial|Foolish]]"-styled effects, which it typically achieves through its multiple Deck Fusion spells.

  The original "Gem-Knight" cards focused on a Beatdown/Toolbox strategy, where a variety of "Gem-Knight" Fusions could be made with Gem-Knights in hand. More recent support has instead enabled an [[FTK]] strategy, using the effects of "[[Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli|Lady Lapis Lazuli]]" and "[[Gem-Knight Master Diamond|Master Diamond]]" to [[burn]] the opponent.

  === Cards ===
  Key Main Deck monsters include:
  * "[[Gem-Knight Obsidian]]" and "[[Gem-Knight Lazuli]]", which have non-once per turn effects that can recycle the player's monsters when sent to the GY, compensating for the costs of Fusion Summoning and extending the player's Fusion plays. 
  * "[[Gem-Knight Quartz]]", if the opponent controls a monster, can search a Continuous Spell that fuses but locks the player into "Gem-Knights". If used as Fusion Material, can recycle a "Gem-Knight" from GY (hard OPT).
  * "[[Crystal Rose]]", which can send a "Gem-Knight" monster to the GY on a soft OPT, and summon itself by banishing a "Gem-Knight" monster on a hard OPT.
  * "[[Gem-Knight Hollowcore]]", which has a Foolish effect as cost, summons itself, and also acts as end board piece.
  * "[[Gem-Knight Nepyrim]]", which is an on-summon searcher with self-revival and swarming support effects.
  * "[[Gem-Armadillo]]", on-summon searcher.

  Relevant Fusion spells include:

  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Fusion Spell !! Summon Lock? !! Material from !! Effects
  |-
  | [[Gem-Knight Fusion]] || No || Hand/Field || Can self-recover from GY, non-once per turn.
  |-
  | [[Absorb Fusion]] || Yes || Hand/Field || Also searches, once per turn.
  |-
  | [[Brilliant Fusion]] || No || Deck || Once per turn.
  |-
  | [[Scatter Fusion]] || Yes || Deck || Conditional activation, once per turn.
  |-
  | [[Gem-Knight Dispersion]] || No || Hand/Field/Deck/Extra Deck || Also searches, conditional deck fusion, once per turn.
  |}

  The Deck's Extra Deck members are almost all Fusion Monsters, and primarily provide combat effects, Spell Speed 1 removal, and effects that [[List of unofficial terms#Cheat out|cheat out]] or copy other "Gem-Knight" Fusions. "[[Gem-Knight Lady Rose Diamond]]" is the Deck's only Extra Deck Quick Effect interruption, and "[[Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli]]" provides burn damage for a potential FTK.

  The Deck's only Link Monster, "[[Gem-Knight Phantom Quartz]]", is a Link 2 that can search any archetypal card and Fusion Summon by using materials from GY/banishment, providing a base level of consistency and combomaking tools.

  The Deck can also benefit from Normal Monster support (like "[[Rescue Rabbit]]" or "[[Unexpected Dai]]"), as well as Fusion support (namely "[[Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra]]" and "[[Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio]]"). "[[Block Dragon]]", as powerful [[Rock]] support, was also a key card before being Limited/Forbidden.

  === Gem-Knight FTK ===
  Gem-Knight FTK aims to swarm the player's own field with monsters and activate the effects of "Lady Lapis Lazuli" once and "Master Diamond" twice to inflict around 8000 damage to the opponent, achieving an FTK.

  "Lady Lapis Lazuli" can burn the opponent for 500 LP for each Special Summoned monster on the field, which is not hard once per turn, but it can only be Special Summoned once per turn. "Master Diamond" can banish "Lady Lapis" to copy its effects, allowing it to be used twice more to deal enough burn damage.

  === As an engine ===
  "[[Brilliant Fusion]]" could be played as a generic engine (3x "Brilliant Fusion", a "Gem-Knight" monster, a LIGHT Monster, "[[Gem-Knight Seraphinite]]"). This got a Level 5 monster on field, a "[[Foolish Burial|Foolish]]" of any LIGHT monster, and another Normal Summon through the effect of "Seraphinite". However, "Brilliant Fusion" is [[Limited]] in the ''OCG'' and ''TCG'', and it requires a "[[Gem-Knight Garnet|Garnet]]" to be played.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Since this Deck relies on Special Summoning many monsters from the Extra Deck in 1 turn, typically consisting of Fusion Monsters, it can be vulnerable to card effects such as those of "[[Dimensional Barrier]]", "[[Non-Fusion Area]]", and "[[Summon Gate]]".
  * Since this Deck relies on using "[[Gem-Knight Fusion]]", it is vulnerable to anti-Spell floodgates such as "[[Naturia Beast]]" and "[[Spell Canceller]]".
  ** Because of the Deck's reliance on using "Gem-Knight Fusion" multiple times in 1 turn, it can also be vulnerable to cards such as "[[Blizzard]]" and "[[Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell]]".
  * Banishing card effects (such as those of "[[Banisher of the Radiance]]", "[[Dimension Shifter]]", and "[[Macro Cosmos]]") can make it difficult for this Deck to continually Fusion Summon, due to their monsters and "Gem-Knight Fusion" getting banished.
  * The Deck has a complete lack of Spell Speed 2 interruptions outside of "[[Gem-Knight Lady Rose Diamond]]" and "[[Gem-Knight Hollowcore]]".
  * The Deck is somewhat xenophobic, since many of its members apply xenolocks or can only summon other "Gem-Knight" members.
  * "[[Gem-Knight Nepyrim]]" halves the player's inflicted burn damage for the turn, meaning it conflicts with the FTK-based game plan.

  == Trivia ==
  * This archetype appears to be based on the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype, since a few of their monsters share similar stats ([[Level]]/[[ATK]]/[[DEF]]) and poses with some "Elemental HERO" monsters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?p=22284095#post22284095 |title=<nowiki>[Official Thread]</nowiki> Hidden Arsenal 4 : Special Edition post #120 |author=[[Kevin Tewart]] |date=July 21, 2011 |publisher=Pojo.com Forums}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?p=22284170#post22284170 |title=<nowiki>[Official Thread]</nowiki> Hidden Arsenal 4 : Special Edition post #123 |author=[[Kevin Tewart]] |date=July 21, 2011 |publisher=Pojo.com Forums}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?p=22284193#post22284193 |title=<nowiki>[Official Thread]</nowiki> Hidden Arsenal 4 : Special Edition post #125 |author=[[Kevin Tewart]] |date=July 21, 2011 |publisher=Pojo.com Forums}}</ref>
  ** The "Gem-Knight" monsters share the same Attribute (EARTH) and have a variety of Types, while the anime "Elemental HERO" monsters share the same Type ([[Warrior]]) and have a variety of Attributes.
  ** This archetype also appears to be based on the "[[Crystal Beast]]" archetype. In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, [[Jesse Anderson]] used the aforementioned archetype, which primarily features a gemstone theme, while [[Jaden Yuki]] uses the "Elemental HERO" archetype, which is mostly centered around Fusion Monsters.
  * While the four "Gem-Knight" Normal Monsters are shown to be unarmed, the Fusion Monsters wield weapons befitting their stats and effects (or lack thereof):
  ** "[[Gem-Knight Aquamarine]]" uses a bladed shield.
  ** "[[Gem-Knight Ruby]]" uses a polearm.
  ** "[[Gem-Knight Topaz]]" uses twin-bladed tonfa.
  ** "[[Gem-Knight Amethyst]]" carries a shield and what is either a wand or a slim blade.
  ** "[[Gem-Knight Citrine]]" uses a fire sword.
  ** "[[Gem-Knight Prismaura]]" wields a lance and shield.
  ** "[[Gem-Knight Zirconia]]" is equipped with gigantic fists.
  ** "[[Gem-Knight Seraphinite]]" uses a saber.
  ** "[[Gem-Knight Master Diamond]]" uses a broadsword embedded with gems.
  ** "[[Gem-Knight Lady Lapis Lazuli]]", which deals effect damage, is depicted without any weapon.
  ** "[[Gem-Knight Lady Brilliant Diamond]]" uses a simple sword.
  * "Gem-Knight" is the first and, so far, only archetype to boast seven "[[Polymerization]]"-styled cards: "[[Gem-Knight Fusion]]", "[[Particle Fusion]]", "[[Pyroxene Fusion]]", "[[Fragment Fusion]]", "[[Absorb Fusion]]", "[[Brilliant Fusion]]", and "[[Scatter Fusion]]".
