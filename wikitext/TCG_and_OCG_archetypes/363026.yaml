  "'''Crystal'''", known as "'''Gem'''" ({{Ruby|宝|ほう}}{{Ruby|玉|ぎょく}} ''Hōgyoku'') in Asia, is an [[archetype]] that includes the "[[Crystal Beast]]" and "[[Ultimate Crystal]]" archetypes and their support cards. It is used in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime by [[Jesse Anderson]].

  The following cards are not "Crystal" cards, because they do not have 「{{Ruby|宝|ほう}}{{Ruby|玉|ぎょく}}」 in their Japanese names:
  * "[[Adamancipator Crystal - Dragite]]"
  * "[[Adamancipator Crystal - Leonite]]"
  * "[[Adamancipator Crystal - Raptite]]"
  * "[[B.E.S. Crystal Core]]"
  * "[[Chronomaly Crystal Bones]]"
  * "[[Chronomaly Crystal Chrononaut]]"
  * "[[Chronomaly Crystal Skull]]"
  * "[[Crystal Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]"
  * "[[Crystal Clear Wing Over Synchro Dragon]]"
  * "[[Crystal Girl]]"
  * "[[Crystal God Tistina]]"
  * "[[Crystal Rose]]"
  * "[[Crystal Seer]]"
  * "[[Crystal Shark]]"
  * "[[Crystal Skull]]"
  * "[[Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon]]"
  * "[[Full Armored Crystalzero Lancer]]"
  * "[[G Golem Crystal Heart]]"
  * "[[Gem-Knight Crystal]]"
  * "[[Marincess Crystal Heart]]"
  * "[[Number 94: Crystalzero]]"
  * "[[Prediction Princess Crystaldine]]"
  * "[[Soulicer Crystal]]"
  * "[[Violet Crystal]]"
  * "[[Windwitch - Crystal Bell]]"
  As the only support of the archeype are [[search]]ers for [[Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s, "Violet Crystal" would be the only real conflict, but it has been given an [[archetype-exclusion condition]]. "[[Counter Gem]]" was also renamed from "Crystal Counter" to resolve the same problem.
