  "'''Impcantation'''", known as "'''Deviritual'''" ({{Ruby|魔神儀|デビリチャル}} ''Debiricharu'') in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] monsters that debuted in ''[[Cybernetic Horizon]]''. The archetype is focused on supporting [[Ritual Summon]]s.

  == Design ==
  Each member of this archetype is an animate version of two objects commonly found in real-life rituals, with its name being a portmanteau of both words.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Impcantation" archetype is an archetype focused on supporting [[Ritual Summon]]ing, by using their own effects to search and retrieve [[Ritual Monster]]s and [[Ritual Spell]]s from both the Deck and GY, and setting up the field with enough levels for Ritual Summoning.

  All non-Ritual "Impcantation" monsters share two common effects, one effect to Special Summon themselves and another "Impcantation" from the Deck, and a second that is Triggered when they are Special Summoned from the Deck. These effects are [[once per turn]], and the player can only use one of the two effects of an "Impcantation" monster per turn.

  : ''"If this card is Special Summoned from the Deck: You can [Individual Effect]."''

  The way these two effects function means that if the player only has one of the two cards required for a Ritual Summon (Ritual Spell or Monster), they can activate a corresponding "Impcantation" in the hand to Special Summon it and a different "Impcantation" from the Deck, and have the latter add the other component to the hand.

  When on the [[field]], the "Impcantation" monsters apply the Continuous effect that the player cannot Special Summon from the [[Extra Deck]].

  The "Impcantation" Ritual Monsters provide additional support for the "Impcantation" Ritual support playstyle in the hand. "[[Impcantation Chalislime|Chalislime]]" can reveal itself to Special Summon a non-Ritual "Impcantation" from the Deck, allowing for an immediate activation of an "Impcantation" search/recovery effect; this has the cost of both [[discard]]ing a card and a hefty 2500 [[LP]] if you do not Ritual Summon after using this effect. "[[Crealtar, the Impcantation Originator|Crealtar]]" has a [[Quick Effect]] to reveal itself in either player's [[Main Phase]]s to Special Summon "Impcantation" monsters from the GY whose total Levels equal 10, but they will be shuffled back into the Deck in the [[End Phase]]; this [[swarm]]ing effect allows an easy setup of a Ritual Summon of a Level 10 or lower Ritual Monster, but it can also alternatively be used to recover "Impcantation" monsters back into the Deck to re-activate their Deck summon trigger effects.

  On the field, the "Impcantation" Ritual Monsters provide some combat capabilities to the "Impcantation" monsters, which is only situationally useful. "Chalislime" can send another "Impcantation" card from the hand or field to the GY to target and destroy an opponent's monster, while "Crealtar" gives the non-Ritual members 2000 ATK and negates their effects, disabling their negative Continuous effect and allowing the usage of the Extra Deck.

  The "Impcantation" archetypal Ritual Spell, "[[Impcantation Inception]]", can be used to Ritual Summon ''any'' Ritual Monster, but restricts the player into only using "Impcantation" monsters for the process, thankfully allowing them to be from the hand or field. Its second effect in the GY Special Summon of an "Impcantation" from the Deck and recovers itself from the GY, at the cost of sending an "Impcantation" card from the hand or field to the GY; this can trigger yet another "Impcantation" search or recovery effect, granting even more Ritual resources.

  The "Impcantation" [[Field Spell]], "[[Impcantation Thanatosis]]", further adds to the swarming capabilities by revealing an "Impcantation" in your hand and Special Summoning 2 more copies of it, then shuffling the revealed copy into the Deck. If a Ritual Monster is Summoned to your field while "Thanatosis" is active, either using the procedure on the card, from the GY or after being [[banish]]ed, you can [[target]] and destroy any 1 card on the field.
