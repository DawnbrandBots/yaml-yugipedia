  "'''Volcanic'''" (ヴォルカニック ''Vorukanikku'') is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Pyro]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Axel Brodie]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. They are related to the "[[Blaze Accelerator (archetype)|Blaze Accelerator]]" archetype of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s. 
  "[[Volcanic Eruption]]" is not a "Volcanic" card because it does not have 「ヴォルカニック」 in its Japanese name.
  ==Appearance==
  [[File:Volcanic.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Axel Brodie]] with "[[Volcanic Hammerer (anime)|Volcanic Hammerer]]" and "[[Volcanic Doomfire (anime)|Volcanic Doomfire]]" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|anime]].]]
  Most of the "Volcanics" are reptilian, combined with military hardware and are intended to be used with the card "[[Blaze Accelerator]]", which [[destroy]]s opposing monsters by using Pyro monsters as "ammunition" by [[send]]ing them from your [[hand]] to the [[Graveyard]].
  ==Playing style==
  The main theme of the "Volcanic" archetype is working in conjunction with the "Blaze Accelerator" cards, inflicting massive [[effect damage]] over time while also steadily destroying the opponent’s board. As a result, monsters such as "[[Volcanic Scattershot]]" and "[[Volcanic Shell]]" are staples within the deck, as they allow for both mass-destruction and regaining [[hand advantage]] respectively. However, the downside of this play-style means often giving up your [[Battle Phase]] in return. Despite this however, some members sport relatively high [[ATK]] values; one such card is "[[Volcanic Rocket]]", which can search out any of the "Blaze Accelerator" cards upon [[Summon]] while providing a good 1900 body, making it essential in any build. Higher [[Level]] members like "[[Volcanic Hammerer]]" sport a healthy 2400 for a Level 5 monster with a chance to inflict healthy amounts of damage, as each "Volcanic" monster in your GY becomes 200 points of damage. With at least 6 copies of both "Shell" and "Scattershot", this can go from a mere 1200 to potentially high enough to end the game after a while. "[[Volcanic Slicer]]" provides a lesser version of this effect as  only inflicts a fixed 500, making it not really worth running. Meanwhile, "[[Volcanic Counter]]" is arguably one of the best members, giving immediate retaliation to any [[battle damage]] taken by throwing an equal amount right back; the only downside is that due to the effect being mandatory the opponent can easily bait this out.
  "[[Volcanic Doomfire]]", the archetype's boss monster, is battle-orientated—it forces the opponent's Attack Position monsters to attack it, which can then activate "Doomfire's" effect to destroy all of the opponent's monsters and inflict 500 damage for each one it destroys. However, Summoning it requires sending a face-up "[[Tri-Blaze Accelerator]]" to the Graveyard.
  "[[Volcanic Queen]]" is similar to "[[Lava Golem]]" and "[[Kaiju]]" monsters, in that it [[Tribute|Tributes]] an opponent's monster to [[Special Summon]] itself to their [[field]] and can inflict 1000 damage to its controller during each of their [[End Phase]]s unless they Tribute another monster. But be warned as they can still use the effect of "Queen" to inflict 1000 damage to you in return.
  As one may guess, "Blaze Accelerator" cards are a must, with each one providing benefits such as "[[Blaze Accelerator Reload]]" giving you draw power. "[[Volcanic Recharge]]" can help prevent running out of ammo for your play-style. If mixing in any FIRE monsters with 200 [[DEF]], you can run "[[Flamvell Counter]]" protect yourself from any opposing [[Spell]]/[[Trap]]s.
  "[[Royal Firestorm Guards]]" is extremely useful within the deck, not only recycling 4 of your monsters in the GY but providing a draw-2 when Summoned. "[[Paleozoic]]" monsters such as "[[Paleozoic Leanchoilia]]" and "[[Paleozoic Marrella]]" can aid in this strategy allowing you to recycle and mill out your reload quicker. "[[Lava Golem]]" also fits in perfectly with the "Volcanic" play-style. Alongside "Queen" this can quickly bring your opponent to being obliterated by "Hammerer", as can "[[Solar Flare Dragon]]" which provide a maximum of 1500 damage during your End Phases per copy of itself present.
