  "'''Archfiend'''", known as "'''Daemon'''" (デーモン ''Dēmon'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is one of the first [[archetype]]s. Members appear in a myriad of sets due to the string required for inclusion being a common alternate spelling of "demon" in Japanese. While many [[Duelist]]s use "Archfiend" cards in the anime and manga as a result, only [[Titan]] and [[Raizo Akuma]] runs dedicated Decks. The majority of the [[Monster Card|monsters]] in this archetype are [[DARK]] [[Fiend]]s, but there are many of other [[Attribute]]s and Types. There are a sub-archetype, "[[Red Dragon Archfiend (archetype)|Red Dragon Archfiend]]", several sub-series, such as the [[Skull Archfiend]]s.

  In general, "Archfiends" possess demonic and gruesome appearances, often featuring exposed bones and muscles reminiscent of their original representative, "Summoned Skull".

  Archfiend is the first archetype to encompass all 6 major Summon mechanics.

  == Naming history ==
  In order for a card to be an "Archfiend" card, it must have the exact string 「デーモン」 (''Dēmon'') in its Japanese name. Other spellings like the standard "Demon" (or any other Japanese word that might be translatable as "demon") do not qualify. For example, the Japanese name of "[[Regenerating Rose]]", 「スプリット・{{Ruby|Ｄ|デモン}}・ローズ」, translates to "Split Demon Rose", with its instance of "Demon" spelled 「デモン」, so it is not an "Archfiend" card.

  The first card to be called "Daemon" was "{{Translated name|Summoned Skull|ja}}" ("[[Summoned Skull]]"), which appeared in the debut chapter of the ''Duel Monsters'' card game, {{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|009|ref}}. Its name is taken from the Japanese translation of the ''[[wikipedia:Magic: The Gathering|Magic: The Gathering]]'' term "Summon Demon", as the Fiend monster was directly based on the Demon creature "[https://gatherer.wizards.com/1E/en-us/0/lord-of-the-pit Lord of the Pit]".

  However, "{{Translated name|Wicked Mirror|ja}}" ("[[Archfiend Mirror|Wicked Mirror]]") and "{{Translated name|Air Marmot of Nefariousness|ja}}" ("[[Archfiend Marmot of Nefariousness|Air Marmot of Nefariousness]]") were the earliest "Daemon" monsters in the ''OCG'', being released in the very first set ''[[Vol.1]]''; "Summoned Skull" would debut in real life with the later ''[[Vol.4]]''.

  The introduction of cards that support those with "Daemon" in their names in ''[[Threat of the Dark Demon World]]'' caused imminent issues as the elegible cards were not translated consistently at all in the ''TCG''. To avoid making the situation worse, it was decided that all "Daemon" cards from that set, as well as future ones, would be called "Archfiend" in the ''TCG'', even though the only existing member named as such was "[[Archfiend of Gilfer]]". The other cards involved were the following:

  {| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; text-align: center" 
  ! ''TCG'' name
  ! Literal translation

  |-
  | [[Summoned Skull]] || {{Translated name|Summoned Skull|ja}}
  |-
  | [[Toon Summoned Skull]] || {{Translated name|Toon Summoned Skull|ja}}
  |}

  To address these, ''[[Upper Deck Entertainment]]'' invented the concept of Archfiend monsters (without quotes) as a type of card, similar to [[ability|abilities]]. However, this was not reflected by the physical versions, and instead it had to be looked up on UDE's website, which had dedicated page stating: 
  {{Quote|'''Archfiends''' are a special category of card. Most "Archfiend" cards can be easily identified by their name. Any card with "Archfiend" in the card name is an "Archfiend." In addition, several older cards are also considered to be "Archfiends." These cards include:}}
  followed by the above list.<ref>{{citeweb|url = http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090226221410/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/yugioh/en/gameplay/faqs/archfiend/default.aspx|title = What is an "Archfiend"?|publisher = Upper Deck Entertainment|date = February 26, 2009|access-date = February 26, 2009}}</ref> 

  As a result, all the initial "Archfiend" support (e.g. "[[Card Errata:Falling Down|Falling Down]]"), when imported in ''[[Dark Crisis]]'', referred to members without using the wording "that has X in its name" that was customary for archetypes at the time. "[[A Deal with Dark Ruler]]" was initially not included in the UDE list as none of these cards interact with [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s that do not remain on the [[field]] after [[activate|activation]].

  The two aforementioned monsters from ''Vol.1'' appeared in English video games also without "Archfiend" in the name, but did not have ''TCG'' prints yet. "Air Marmot" was later released with the new name "Archfiend Marmot of Nefariousness", while "Wicked Mirror" (which is still unimported to this day) was renamed to "Archfiend Mirror" starting with ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force]]''.

  The introduction of [[archetype condition]]s 7 years later presented an alternative to the special category approach, as the above cards could be reprinted to receive one stating that they belonged to the "Archfiend" archetype, and remove the need to direct players to external references. This began with "Axe of Despair" in ''[[Battle Pack 2: War of the Giants]]'', and all the others were updated in ''[[Legendary Collection 4: Joey's World Mega Pack]]''.

  == Sub-themes ==
  Due to its large size, the "Archfiend" archetype includes many groups of cards that tend to have separate playstyles, and don't necessary synergize with each other.

  === Chess Archfiends ===
  The first cohesive group introduced after "Archfiend" became an archetype are chess-themed, all of which are named after the game's pieces and feature a chessboard pattern as the background of their artworks. Each monster has a dice rolling effect with a change to negate card effects that targets it.

  |}

  While unrelated theme-wise, "[[Skull Archfiend of Lightning]]" shares the same kind of effect. Additionally, "[[Pandemonium]]" featured an effect that offset the downsides of these monsters.

  === Red Dragon Archfiend ===
  {{Main|Red Dragon Archfiend}}
  This sub-archetype consists of the [[Synchro Monster]] "[[Red Dragon Archfiend]]" and its upgrades and retrains. It is closely related to the "[[Resonator]]" archetype. "[[Bone Archfiend]]" is also designed as support for it, rather than being general "Archfiend" support.

  === Imperial Archfiends ===
  These "Archfiend" cards emphatize effects relating to destruction, both of opponent's cards and benefiting off destroying themselves and other "Archfiend" monsters. These have generally purple color schemes, a metallic appearance, and a militaristic imperial theme.

  The earliest member of this sub-series was "Archfiend Empress" from the ''TCG'' version of ''[[Starstrike Blast]]'', though it was only established much later in ''[[Judgement of the Light]]''.

  * [[Archfiend Empress]]
  * [[Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror]]
  * [[Archfiend Heiress]]
  * [[Archfiend Cavalry]]
  * [[Archfiend Commander]]
  * [[Archfiend Eccentrick]]
  * [[Archfiend Palabyrinth]]

  The previously released "[[Archfiend Soldier]]" and "[[Archfiend General]]" may also be considered related to this group theme-wise, thouigh not in terms of effect. Meanwhile, the later released "[[Annihilator Archfiend]]" and "[[Berserk Archfiend]]" are unrelated theme-wise, but share the destruction-benefiting effects seen in this sub-series. "[[Archfiend Giant]]" acts as a crossover between this group and the Chess Archfiends, taking aesthetic and effect cues from both.

  === Skull Archfiend ===
  {{Main|Skull Archfiend}}
  These cards are themed around the original "[[Summoned Skull]]", being its retrains or evolutions.

  The following four cards in particular have the effect "This card's name becomes "Summoned Skull" on the field, but is still treated as an "Archfiend" card."

  | [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]]
  |-

  | [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]]
  |}

  "Archfiend Commander" and "[[Archfiend's Advent]]" also follow this group's naming scheme and are designed as "Summoned Skull" retrains, but do not have the name-changing effect.

  === Ritual Archfiends ===
  A group of [[Ritual Monster]]-focused "Archfiend" cards that made their debut in ''[[Burst Protocol]]''. They are tied to the Imperial Archfiends due to their aethetics also deriving from "Archfiend Empress" (through its younger form "Heiress" being retrained into "Highness"), but their effects focus on [[banish]]ing instead of destroying.

  * [[Royal Archfiend]]
  * [[Duke Archfiend]]
  * [[Highness Archfiend]]
  * [[Doom Emperor Archfiend]]
  * [[Throne of Archfiends]]
  * [[Archfiend's Strategy Game]]
  * [[Archfiend's Jest]]
  * [[Archfiend's Vigor]]

  === Archetypal ===
  A notable aspect of the "Archfiend" archetype is that many cards that are part of it are instead designed as part of other themes, rather than as support for an "Archfiend" strategy.

  === Others ===
  * A sports-themed trio ("[[Archfiend Interceptor]]", "[[Lancer Archfiend]]", "[[Mad Archfiend]]"), used by [[Jack Atlas]] but unrelated to the "Red Dragon Archfiends".
  * A group of [[Psychic]] [[Synchro Monster]]s with a focus on [[LP]] gain ("[[Thought Ruler Archfiend]]", "[[Overmind Archfiend]]", "[[Crossmind Archfiend]]"), designed for [[Sayer]]'s Deck.

  == Playing style ==
  Because of the huge variety of cards given to the theme over the years, there are many variants of "Archfiend" Decks even aside the explict sub-themes, in some cases made possible by the abundant generic support the archetype has access to.

  === Chess ===
  Building a Deck around the "Chess Archfiends" is tricky since they require mandatory [[LP]] payments every turn. As a result, the player's LP will be drained very quickly, especially since they must worry about further losses through [[battle]] as these "Archfiends" tend to lack enough ATK to hold their ground, and their most useful ability is negating an opponent's effect that targets them by a [[dice roll]]. However, this is not a reliable defense, and only two of them have a 50% chance of negation (although one of them, "[[Darkbishop Archfiend]]", works for any "Archfiend", including the ones that have their own protection), whereas most have a ~17% chance, and a couple have a ~33% chance. Nonetheless, they can benefit from some cards used by [[Duke Devlin]], namely "[[Dice Dungeon]]"and "[[Dimension Dice]]", to gain a bit of speed and power.

  === Pandemonium ===
  Later "Archfiends" such as "[[Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror]]" and "[[Annihilator Archfiend]]" tend to go for a destruction strategy to pave the way to attack the opponent directly with their high-Level and high-ATK monsters. However, they can also be used together with "[[Archfiend Commander]]" and "[[Berserk Archfiend]]" to [[destroy]] the player's own monsters to gain advantage by [[trigger]]ing their effects. Namely, "[[Archfiend Heiress]]" and "[[Trance Archfiend]]" can add "Archfiend" cards to the player's hand from the [[Main Deck]] and [[banish]]ment respectively, while "[[Archfiend Cavalry]]" and "[[Archfiend Empress]]" have reviving effects very useful to bring the high-Level members of the archetype onto the [[field]]. "[[Pandemonium]]" becomes extremely powerful in this variant as it has a non-[[once per turn]] effect to search for lower-Level "Archfiends" every time one is destroyed in almost every location. "[[Mist Archfiend]]" was once a pretty reliable way to trigger it after taking down an opponent's monster thanks to its high ATK, but this now remains true only in retro formats like HAT and Edison, as it is too slow to be useful nowadays. Meanwihile, "[[Unchained]]" monsters have great synergy with this strategy while also being very fast and generic, and can give "Archfiends" a few interruptions thanks to their [[Link Monster]]s and [[Spell]]/[[Trap]]s.

  === Lightsworn ===
  Being a cross-archetype card, "[[Weiss, Lightsworn Archfiend]]" allows "Archfiends" to be mixed up with the "[[Lightsworn]]" theme. Despite "Lightsworns" caring little to nothing about self-destruction, their boss monster, "[[Judgment Dragon]]", can blow up the entire board and trigger the effects of the "Archfiend" cards. Also, being a [[Level]] 8 monster, it can be used with "Archfiend Empress" and "Archfiend Emperor" to [[Xyz Summon]] [[Rank]] 8 [[Xyz Monster]]s, or just attack en mass to win the game. The [[LIGHT]] "Lightsworn" [[Tuner monster|Tuners]] can also give access to "[[Chaos]]" monsters, such as, appropriately enough, "[[Chaos Archfiend]]" to clear the way for a direct attack. Finally, the [[List of unofficial terms#Mill|milling]] strategy of the "Lightsworn" cards can serve to fill the [[Graveyard]] with "Archfiend" monsters for later revival, and will eventually trigger "Archfiend Heiress".

  === Fiendsmith ===
  One of the most powerful variant of the theme thanks to the innate strength of the "[[Fiendsmith]]" archetype, a Fiendsmith Archfiend Deck is focused on Rank 6 plays thanks to the amount of Level 6 "Archfiends" and the self-revival effects of "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" and "[[Aerial Eater]]". The latter is also an easy way to trigger "Archfiend Heiress" by [[send]]ing it to the Graveyard directly from the Main Deck, while the former can give "Archfiends" access to any LIGHT Fiend in the game via "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]". "Archfiends" themselves have some members searchable with "Tract", such as "Weiss", "[[Archfiend Eccentrick|Eccentrick]]", and "[[Desrook Archfiend|Desrook]]". Each of them can be used as the sole [[Link Material]] required to [[Link Summon]] "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]", which in turn gives the player access to the entire "Fiendsmith" engine, or paired with another monster to go into "[[Fiendsmith's Sequence]]", which can [[Fusion Summon]] a Fiend [[Fusion Monster]] basically for free. "[[The Duke of Demise]]" is a particularly good choice, because it can give "Archfiends" a way to unbrick their hand when drawing too many monsters to [[Normal Summon]], as well as even more recovery. The [[Forbidden|Forbidding]] of "[[Fiendsmith's Lacrima]]" and "[[Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal]]" hinder the extending ability of this engine, so it's no longer possible to spam Rank 6 monsters efficiently, but the Deck can still achieve decent Link climbing.

  === Ritual ===
  This variant makes heavy usage of Ritual support such as "[[Preparation of Rites]]" and "[[Dark Necromancer]]", and alongside the new "[[Doom Emperor Archfiend]]" can also play "[[Archfiend Matador]]" and "[[Archfiend's Awakening]]" as additional Ritual Summons. The effect of "[[Duke Archfiend]]" being used to send "Heiress" allows for access to many different avenues of play, from extenders like "[[Highness Archfiend]]" to access to Synchro plays through "Weiss, Lightsworn Archfiend", or even control tools like "[[Archfiend's Ghastly Glitch]]" and "[[Simul Archfiends]]".

  === Other variants ===
  Three generic "Archfiend" [[Equip Spell Card]]s exist: the classic "[[Axe of Despair]]" boosts ATK and can recycle itself, "[[Falling Down]]" is an in-theme "[[Snatch Steal]]", and the more recent "[[Archfiend's Staff of Despair]]" is a weakening version of "Axe of Despair". With the addition of "[[Spirit Illusion]]", which is able to Fusion Summon or extend Fiend/[[Zombie]] plays by Summoning a Token, a Deck built around Equip Spells is possible.

  "[[Summoned Skull]]" also makes "[[Primite]]" a viable engine, with it being Level 6 just like "[[Primite Imperial Dragon]]" creating some additional synergy.

  Finally, another popular option is to mix "Archfiends" with the "[[Unchained]]" or "[[Yubel (archetype)|Yubel]]" archetypes, which also benefit from self-destruction.

  == Weaknesses ==
  * The effects of "Archfiends" apply mostly on the field or in the Graveyard, as such cards such as "[[Skill Drain]]" and "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" can hinder the strategy.
  * As most of the members have high Levels, "[[Gravity Bind]]" can prevent a game-winning attack from happening.
  * "[[Vampire Hunter]]" and "[[Exile of the Wicked]]" can destroy "Archfiends" without needing to beat their high ATK.
  * Older versions of the Deck are typically slow, often requiring Normal Summons to begin swarming. Cards that can negate the Summon such as "[[Solemn Judgment]]" and "[[Chaos Trap Hole]]" can take away a whole turn.
  * The Chess variant of the Deck often requires paying a lot of LP, so can have difficulty against [[stall]] and [[burn]] strategies.
