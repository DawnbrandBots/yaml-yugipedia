  }}
  "'''Archfiend'''", known as "'''Daemon'''" (デーモン ''Dēmon'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is one of the very first [[archetype]]s. Members appear in a myriad of sets due to the string required for inclusion being a simple word in Japanese. While many [[Duelist]]s use "Archfiend" cards in the anime and manga as a result, only [[Titan]] and [[Raizo Akuma]] runs a dedicated "Archfiend" Deck. The majority of the [[Monster Card|monsters]] in this archetype are [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] monsters, but there are many monsters of other [[Attribute]]s and Types. There are cards, such as [[Falling Down]], which supports any "Archfiend" cards. There are a sub-archetype, "[[Red Dragon Archfiend (archetype)|Red Dragon Archfiend]]", and a sub-series, [[Skull Archfiend]].

  == History/Naming ==
  The first monster to receive the "Archfiend" designation is "[[Summoned Skull]]", which has appeared in the first manga chapter featuring ''Duel Monsters'', [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Duel 009|Duel 009]], as well as the [[Yu-Gi-Oh!_Duel_Monsters_(video_game)|first ''Duel Monsters'' video game]]. "[[Wicked Mirror]]" and "[[Air Marmot of Nefariousness]]" are the first Archfiend monsters to appear in the ''OCG'', appearing in the [[Vol.1|very first set]].

  The introduction of the "Archfiend" (「デーモン」) archetype in ''[[Dark Crisis]]'' caused a translation issue - it was decided that all future cards would be named "Archfiend", but many previous members were not named as such in the ''TCG'':

  {| class="wikitable mw-collapsible autocollapse" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; text-align: center" 
  |+ List
  ! TCG Name
  ! Direct Translation
  |-
  | [[A Deal with Dark Ruler]] || A Deal with a Daemon
  |-
  | [[Axe of Despair]] || Daemon's Axe
  |-
  | [[Black Skull Dragon]] || Black Daemons Dragon
  |-
  | [[Beast of Talwar]] || Talwar Daemon
  |- 
  | [[Fiend Skull Dragon]] || Death Daemon Dragon
  |- 
  | [[Lesser Fiend]] || Lesser Daemon
  |-
  | [[Shadow Tamer]] || Daemon Tamer
  |-
  | [[Summoned Skull]] || Summoned Daemon
  |-
  | [[Toon Summoned Skull]] || Toon Daemon
  |}

  Two cards ([[Archfiend Marmot of Nefariousness]] and [[Archfiend Mirror]]) appeared in English video games without "Archfiend" in the name, but did not have TCG printings yet. "Marmot's" name was changed for its TCG release, and in the games, their names were changed starting from ''[[World Championship 2006]]'' (for "Marmot") and ''[[Archfiend_Mirror_(Tag_Force_1)|Tag Force 1]]'' (for "Mirror").

  To address the other cards, [[Upper Deck Entertainment]] invented the idea of Archfiend monsters (rather than "Archfiend" monsters) as a separate category, similar to existing [[ability|abilities]]. Due to the circumstances, they were not printed on the card but rather could only be looked up via UDE's website, which stated: ''"'''Archfiends''' are a special category of card. Most "Archfiend" cards can be easily identified by their name. Any card with "Archfiend" in the card name is an "Archfiend." In addition, several older cards are also considered to be "Archfiends." These cards include:'' followed by the above list.<ref>{{citeweb|url = http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090226221410/http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/yugioh/en/gameplay/faqs/archfiend/default.aspx|title = What is an "Archfiend"?|publisher = Upper Deck Entertainment|date = February 26, 2009|access-date = February 26, 2009}}</ref> 

  As a result, all "Archfiend" support in the original printing of ''Dark Crisis'' (e.g., "[[Card Errata:Falling Down|Falling Down]]") referred to Archfiend cards as if they were a category (rather than "Archfiend" cards as an archetype). "[[A Deal with Dark Ruler]]" was initially excluded from this list, as no "Archfiend" support at the time could reference it. However, later cards like "[[Archfiend Heiress]]" would refer to adding any "Archfiend" card from the Deck to the hand, and it was added then.

  The introduction of [[archetype condition]]s 7 years later would remove the need for any special category, and later prints of the above list of cards in the ''TCG'' would all receive one stating that they belonged to the "Archfiend" archetype. This began with "Axe of Despair" in ''[[Battle Pack 2: War of the Giants]]'', and finished with the release of ''[[Legendary Collection 4: Joey's World Mega Pack]]''.

  In order for a card to be an "Archfiend" card, it must have the exact string 「デーモン」 ("Daemon") in its Japanese name. Other spellings like "Demon" (or any other Japanese word that might be translatable as "demon") do not qualify. For example, the Japanese name of "[[Regenerating Rose]]", 「スプリット・{{Ruby|Ｄ|デモン}}・ローズ」, translates directly to "Split Demon Rose" with "Demon" spelled 「デモン」, so it is not an "Archfiend" card.

  == Themes ==
  In general, Archfiends possess demonic and gruesome features, some even going so far as to have physiques featuring bones and sinew reminiscent of their original representative, "Summoned Skull".

  === Chess ===
  The first members introduced after "Archfiend" became an archetype are chess-themed, all of which are named after chess pieces, and feature a chessboard pattern as the background of their artwork. Each monster had a dice rolling effect which could negate an effect that targeted it, provided the die roll was correct.

  While unrelated theme-wise, "[[Skull Archfiend of Lightning]]" was released as part of this group and shared the same kind of effect. Additionally, "[[Pandemonium]]" featured an effect that offset the downsides of these monsters.

  === Red Dragon Archfiend ===
  {{Main|Red Dragon Archfiend}}

  This sub-archetype consists of the original "[[Red Dragon Archfiend]]" and its upgrades/retrains. It is closely related to the "[[Resonator]]" archetype.

  === Skull Archfiend ===
  {{Main|Skull Archfiend}}
  These cards are themed around original "[[Summoned Skull]]", either being retrains or fusions of that monster.

  The following four cards, released in ''[[Fists of the Gadgets]]'', each have the condition: "This card's name becomes "Summoned Skull" on the field, but is still treated as an "Archfiend" card."

  === Imperial ===
  Archfiend cards starting from "[[Archfiend Empress]]" began to emphasis effects relating to destruction, both of opponent's cards and benefiting off destroying themselves and other "Archfiend" monsters. These have generally purple color schemes, a metallic appearance, and a militaristic imperial theme. While predated by "Archfiend Empress" by several years, the majority of this series debuted in ''[[Judgement of the Light]]''.

  The previously released "[[Archfiend Soldier]]" and "[[Archfiend General]]" related to this group theme-wise, but not in terms of effect. Meanwhile, the later released "[[Annihilator Archfiend]]" and "[[Berserk Archfiend]]" are unrelated theme-wise, but share the destruction-benefiting effects seen throughout the other members. "[[Archfiend Giant]]" acts as a crossover between this group and the prior Chess-theme, taking aesthetic and effect cues from both series.

  === Other series ===
  * A sports-themed series of Archfiends ("[[Archfiend Interceptor]]", "[[Lancer Archfiend]]", "[[Mad Archfiend]]"), released in the 5DS era.
  * A group of [[Psychic]] type Archfiend [[Synchro Monster]]s with a focus on life point regaining ("[[Thought Ruler Archfiend]]", "[[Overmind Archfiend]]", "[[Thought Cross Archfiend]]"). This group also has related [[Fusion Monster]]s who lack the "Archfiend" title ("[[Ultimate Axon Kicker]]", "[[Absolute Axon Kicker]]").
  * Cards that primarily belong to other archetypes but have "Archfiend" in their name, such as "[[Infernity Archfiend]]", "[[Labrynth Archfiend]]", and "[[Mimighoul Archfiend]]".

  == Playing style ==
  Because of the huge variety of cards given to the theme over the years, there are many variants of "Archfiend" Decks, in some cases made possible by the many generic supports the archetype has access to.

  === Chess Archfiend ===
  Building a Deck around the "Chess Archfiends" is tricky since they require your [[Life Points]] as payment and paying is not optional. As a result, your LP will be drained very quickly, especially since you must worry about further losses of LP through [[battle damage]] from your opponent's monsters. In fact, "Archfiends" tend to lack enough attack power to hold their ground, as their most useful ability is negating an opponent's effect that targets them by a [[dice roll]]. However, this is not a much reliable defense, and only two of the cards have a 50% chance of negation (although one of them, "[[Darkbishop Archfiend]]", works for any of your Archfiends, including the ones that have their own protection), whereas the most have a ~17% chance, and a couple have a ~33% chance. Nonetheless, they can benefits of some recent cards based on [[Duke Devlin]]'s Dice Pool, namely "[[Dice Dungeon]]"and "[[Dimension Dice]]", to gain a bit of speed and power.

  === Pandemonium Turbo ===
  Later "Archfiends" such as "[[Archfiend Emperor, the First Lord of Horror]]" and "[[Annihilator Archfiend]]" tend to go for a destruction strategy to pave the way to attack the opponent directly with their high-Level high-ATK Monsters. However, they can also be used, together with "[[Archfiend Commander]]" and "[[Berserk Archfiend]]", to [[destroy]] the player's own monsters to gain advantage by [[trigger]]ing their effects. Namely, "[[Archfiend Heiress]]" and "[[Trance Archfiend]]" can add "Archfiend" cards to the player's hand from the [[Main Deck]] and [[banishment]] respectively, while "[[Archfiend Cavalry]]" and "[[Archfiend Empress]]" have [[List of unofficial terms|reviving]] effects very useful to bring the high-Level members of the archetype onto the [[field]]. "[[Pandemonium]]" becomes extremely powerful in this variant as it has a non-[[once per turn]] effect to search for lower-Level "Archfiends" everytime one is destroyed (from almost every location). "[[Mist Archfiend]]" was once a pretty reliable way to trigger it after taking down an opponent's monster thanks to its high ATK, but this now remains true only in retro formats like HAT Format and Edison Format, whereas it is definitely too slow to be useful nowadays. On the contrary, "[[Unchained]]" monsters have great synergy with this strategy while also being very fast and generic, and they can give "Archfiends" a few interruptions thanks to their [[Link Monster]]s and [[Spell]]/[[Trap]]s.

  === Lightsworn Archfiend ===
  Being a cross-archetype card, "[[Weiss, Lightsworn Archfiend]]" allows "Archfiends" to be mixed up with the "[[Lightsworn]]" theme. Despite "Lightsworns" cares little to nothing about self-destruction, their boss monster, "[[Judgment Dragon]]", can blow up the entire board and trigger the effects of the aforementioned "Archfiend" cards. Also, being a [[Level 8]] monster, it can be used with "Archfiend Empress" and "Archfiend Emperor" to [[Xyz Summon]] [[Rank 8]] [[Xyz Monster]]s, otherwise they can just attack in mass to win the game. "[[Chaos Archfiend]]" is another option to clear the way for a direct attack, made accessible by the "Lightsworn" [[LIGHT]] [[Tuner]] monsters, and the DARK/LIGHT combination of [[Attribute]]s can generically give access to a plethora of "[[Chaos]]" monsters. Finally, the [[List of unofficial terms|milling]] strategy of the "Lightsworn" cards can serve to fill the [[Graveyard]] with "Archfiend" monsters for later revive, and will eventually trigger "Archfiend Heiress".

  === Fiendsmith Archfiend ===
  Perhaps the most powerful variant of the theme until now thanks to the innate strength of the "[[Fiendsmith]]" archetype, a Fiendsmith Archfiend Deck is focused on [[Rank 6]] plays thanks to the amount of [[Level 6]] "Archfiends" currently existing and the self-revive effects of "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" and "[[Aerial Eater]]". The latter is also an easy way to trigger "Archfiend Heiress" by [[send]]ing it to the Graveyard directly from the Main Deck, while the former can give "Archfiends" access to any LIGHT Fiend monster in the game via "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]". "Archfiends" themselves have some members searchable the said Spell Card, "Weiss" and "[[Archfiend Eccentrick]]" but accompained by "[[Desrook Archfiend]]". Each of them can be used as the sole [[Link Material]] required to [[Link Summon]] "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]", which in turn gives the player access to the entire "Fiendsmith" engine, or paired with another monster to go into "[[Fiendsmith's Sequence]]", which can [[Fusion Summon]] a Fiend [[Fusion Monster]] basically for free. "[[The Duke of Demise]]" is a particularly good one, because it can give "Archfiends" a way to unbrick their hand when drawing too many monsters to [[Normal Summon]], as well as even more recovery. The ban of "[[Fiendsmith's Lacrima]]" and "[[Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal]]" hindered the extending ability of this engine, so its no longer possible to spam Rank 6 monsters efficiently, but can still achieve a decent Link climbing.

  === Other variants ===
  Three "Archfiend" [[Equip Spell]]s exist with different effects: the old "[[Axe of Despair]]" boosts ATK and can return to the hand, "[[Falling Down]]" is an thematic "[[Snatch Steal]]", and the new "[[Archfiend's Staff of Despair]]", is an enfeebling version of "Axe of Despair". Considering also "[[Spirit Illusion]]", which is able to Fusion Summon or extend Fiend/[[Zombie]] plays by Summoning a Token, a Deck build around Equip Spells can be an idea.

  The existence of "[[Summoned Skull]]'s" [[series]], which is covered more on its own page, [[Skull Archfiend]], makes instead "[[Primite]]" a viable engine to [[List of unofficial terms|float]] one the most iconic [[Normal Monster]] in the game. Also, "[[Primite Imperial Dragon]]" being Level 6 is a specially lucky case.

  Finally, another popular option is to mix "Archfiend" with the "[[Yubel (archetype)|Yubel]]" archetype, which benefits from self-destruction too.

  == Weaknesses ==
  * The effects of "Archfiends" apply mostly on the field or in the Graveyard; as such cards such as "[[Skill Drain]]" and "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" can hinder the strategy.
  * As most of the members are high Level, "[[Gravity Bind]]" can prevent a game winning attack from happening.
  * "[[Vampire Hunter]]" and "[[Exile of the Wicked]]" can destroy "Archfiends" without needing to beat their high ATK.
  * The deck is also typically slow, requiring Normal Summons of an Archfiend to begin swarming. Cards that can negate the Summon such as "[[Solemn Judgment]]" and "[[Chaos Trap Hole]]" can take away a whole turn.
  * The deck often requires paying a lot of Life Points, so can have difficulty against [[stall]] and [[burn]] strategies.
