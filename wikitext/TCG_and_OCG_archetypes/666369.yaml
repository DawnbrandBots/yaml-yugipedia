  "'''Megalith'''" (メガリス ''Megarisu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Rock]] [[Ritual Monster]]s introduced in ''[[Ignition Assault]]''.
  ==Lore==
  {{Main|Master Duel card storylines#The Mystery of the Megalith}}
  ==Design==
  The "Megalith" monsters are based on the seven [[wikipedia:Olympian spirits|Olympian spirits]], which are spiritual entities mentioned in Renaissance and post-Renaissance works such as ''[[wikipedia:Arbatel de magia veterum|Arbatel de magia veterum]]'', ''[[wikipedia:The Secret Grimoire of Turiel|The Secret Grimoire of Turiel]]'' and ''The Complete Book of Magic Science''.
  Visually, the monsters can be divided into three groups based on their [[Level]]:
  * The Level 4 monsters are static statues made of white and black stone adorned with gold, situated upon a heptagonal base: these monsters are "[[Megalith Ophiel|Ophiel]]", "[[Megalith Och|Och]]", and "[[Megalith Hagith|Hagith]]".
  * The Level 8 monsters are animate statues of powerful monsters emerging from the heptagonal base of their respective base form: "[[Megalith Aratron|Aratron]]" ("Och"), "[[Megalith Bethor|Bethor]]" ("Hagith"), and "[[Megalith Phaleg|Phaleg]]" ("Ophiel").
  * The Level 2 "[[Megalith Phul]]" is a feminine humanoid statue made out of shimmering crystals emerging from "[[Megalith Unformed]]", which is a portal made up of the shattered pieces of "Aratron", "Bethor", and "Phaleg".
  Based on the artworks and the effects of "[[Megalith Emergence]]", "[[Megalith Promotion]]", and "Megalith Unformed", the Level 8 "Megalith" monsters are transformed versions of the Level 4 monsters, transforming themselves by breaking out of their static statue forms into their powerful forms. They would eventually be shattered to form a portal, from which the lowest base form of these monsters, "Phul", emerges.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Megalith" archetype is focused on [[Ritual Monster]]s, but is unique in that the archetype's monsters can perform [[Ritual Summon]]s with their [[Performs a Ritual Summon|own effects]], without the need of [[Ritual Spell]]s.

  The "Megalith" monsters can be divided by [[Level]] into three types, each of which have their own pattern of Ritual Summoning effects. All "Megalith" monsters' Ritual Summoning effects can only be activated in the [[Main Phase]], and require [[Tributing]] monsters from the [[hand]] or [[field]] whose total Levels equal or exceed the Level of the Ritual Monster being Summoned.

  The individual effects of the "Megalith" monsters besides their Ritual Summoning effects are much more varied. In general, the Level 8 "Megalith" monsters serves as the main beaters, and the Levels 4 and 2 "Megalith" monsters provide consistency or generate advantage.

  |}
  Taken together, "[[Megalith Phul]]" is the deck's central combo enabler; its effect to Special Summon from the Deck is a major consistency boost, and its ability to recover Ritual Monsters and modulate its own levels greatly increases the amount of levels available to the player for Ritual Summoning (for the low cost of 2 levels to Ritual Summon "Phul").

  "Megalith" Spell/Traps further support the deck's Ritual-based game plan. The key "Megalith" Spell is "[[Megalith Unformed]]", a [[Quick-Play Spell]] capable of Ritual Summoning "Megalith" monsters directly from the Deck, with the restriction that the monsters Tributed must have total Levels that are ''exactly'' twice the Level of Summoned monster. Other Spell/Traps provide situational utility: "[[Megalith Promotion]]" provides more Levels for Tributing, "[[Megalith Emergence]]" revives "Megalith" monsters from the GY, and "[[Megalith Portal]]" provides battle protection and extra recursion.

  Generally, the "Megalith" game plan aims to tutor out "[[Megalith Phul|Phul]]" with "[[Megalith Hagith|Hagith]]" (via "[[Megalith Unformed|Unformed]]") and "[[Megalith Ophiel|Ophiel]]", and then use "Phul" to tutor out the Level 8 "Megalith" boss monsters for board control. The ability for "Phul" and "Unformed" to Ritual Summon at [[Spell Speed 2]] enables the powerful play of Ritual Summoning "[[Megalith Bethor|Bethor]]" on the opponent's turn for a disruptive mass destruction.

  Externally, "Megalith" synergizes with generic Ritual support, such as the "[[Impcantation]]" engine, as well as [[Rock]] support, such as "[[Block Dragon]]" .

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Since they are a Ritual-focused archetype, they rely heavily on [[Special Summon]]ing and [[Tribute|Tributing]], so any cards that shut down Special Summoning and Tributing can really cripple this deck. The Deck also suffers from a major lack of recovery effects, the only in-theme ones being "Megalith Portal" and "Phul", both of which are hard once per turn.

  ==Trivia==
  * The "Megalith" monsters introduced in ''[[Ignition Assault]]'' are the first [[Rock]] [[Ritual Monster]]s.
