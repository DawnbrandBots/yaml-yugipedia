  {{Quote|[[Yuto]] on the "Phantom Knights"|Phantom Knights will never fall! No matter how many times you destroy them, they will always revive!}}
  "'''The Phantom Knights'''", known as "'''Phantom Knights'''" ({{Ruby|幻影騎士団|ファントム・ナイツ}} ''Fantomu Naitsu'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] and [[Trap Monster]]s used by [[Yuto]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime and manga. It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Phantom Knights]]" archetype.

  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  The monsters visually appear to be ghostly beings, while the [[Trap Monster]]s appear to be animated armor/weapons surrounded by ghostly flames. They use the naming scheme "The Phantom Knights of {adjective} {clothing item/weapon}" in the TCG, or "Phantom Knights {adjective} {clothing item/weapon}" in the OCG, with the namesake item being featured in the artwork of each respective card.

  ===Etymology===
  The adjectives for the monsters appear to be words related to disrepair, disuse, and emptiness, while the adjectives for the Trap Monsters seem to relate to darkness, death, emptiness, and mistake. In Japanese, the archetype's kanji name reads "{{Ruby|幻|げん}}{{Ruby|影|えい}}{{Ruby|騎|き}}{{Ruby|士|し}}{{Ruby|団|だん}}" (''Gen'ei Kishidan'', lit. "Phantom Knights Order").

  ==Playing style==

  ===General===
  The "[[Phantom Knights]]" strategy revolves around sending their cards to the [[GY]] to net advantage. Each Main Deck "The Phantom Knights" monster, and many of their supporting Spells/Traps, have effects to [[banish]] itself for a beneficial effect (often searching or sending archetypal cards to the GY). These plays are meant to set up the [[Xyz Summon]] of [[Rank]] 2-4 [[DARK]] [[Xyz Monster]]s, supporting them with stat-increasing and protection effects. Several cards have a "banish this card when it leaves the field" effect, though by attaching them to an Xyz monster, this effect will not be applied.

  * "[[The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales|Torn Scales]]" is one of the major playmakers, and the main Normal Summon of pure versions of the strategy. On field, it can discard a card to send a "Phantom Knights" card to the GY. In GY, it can summon itself if another "The Phantom Knights" card is on field.
  * "[[The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots|Silent Boots]]" acts as the archetype's main extender, able to Special Summon itself if you control a "The Phantom Knights" monster. In GY, it can banish itself to search a "Phantom Knights" Spell/Trap.
  * "[[The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak|Ancient Cloak]]" and "[[The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves|Ragged Gloves]]" have weak on-field effects, but useful GY effects. "Ancient Cloak" can banish itself to search a "The Phantom Knights" card, while "Ragged Gloves" can send a "Phantom Knights" card from Deck to GY.
  * "[[The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves|Stained Greaves]]", "[[The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine|Shade Brigandine]]", and "[[Raider's Wing]]" can each act as extenders, each being relatively easy to Special Summon.

  Each "Phantom Knights" Trap (except those part of the "[[Raidraptor]]" archetype) can either banish itself to Summon a "The Phantom Knights" monster from the GY, or Summon itself as a monster. "[[Phantom Knights' Fog Blade|Fog Blade]]" is the most important, acting as a monster negate on field, and has the former summon effect. "[[Phantom Knights' Wing|Wing]]" and [[Phantom Knights' Sword|Sword]]" offer ATK-increasing effects and also share the former summon effect. The rest can summon themselves as monsters: "[[The Phantom Knights of Tomb Shield|Tomb Shield]]" can act as a situational Trap negate, "[[The Phantom Knights of Mist Claws|Mist Claws]]" can summon itself and a "Phantom Knights" monster in GY, "[[The Phantom Knights of Lost Vambrace|Lost Vambrace]]" can protect monsters from battle. 

  Among the Xyz monsters, the Rank 3 "[[The Phantom Knights of Break Sword]]" can destroy 1 card on each field, and if destroyed, can Special Summon 2 "The Phantom Knights" monsters from the GY with levels increased by 1 (enabling Rank 4 plays). "[[Raider's Knight]]" is a Rank 4 that can summon a Rank 3/5 Xyz monster, enabling OTK plays with cards like "[[Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]". While "[[The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin|Cursed Javelin]]" has a useful monster negate, it is Rank 2, which is difficult for the Deck to make.

  "[[The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche]]" is a powerful Link-3 monster that can both Set a "Phantom Knights" Spell/Trap and send a "The Phantom Knights" monster from Deck to the GY. As it requires DARK monsters as material, it could be used as an engine in other DARK Decks. Afterwards, Special Summoning a DARK Xyz Monster to a zone "Rusty Bardiche" points to triggers its second effect to destroy any card on the field, allowing additional destruction on top of "Break Sword".

  "Phantom Knights" can also utilize two "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" Spells: "[[The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch]]" and "[[Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force]]" which can be used to Summon stronger DARK Xyz Monsters.

  ===Other additions===
  Since the release of ''[[Phantom Rage]]'', "Phantom Knights" have received crossover support with the "[[Raidraptor]]" and "[[Xyz Dragon]]" archetypes, namely "Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force", "[[Raider's Knight]]", "[[Raider's Wing]]", "[[Raider's Unbreakable Mind]] and "[[Raidraptor's Phantom Knights Claw]]". These made it easier to use the "Xyz Dragon" monsters (especially "[[Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]" alongside its upgraded forms "[[Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon]]" or "[[Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]").

  "[[Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss]]" is an important part of the Deck, since each monster is Level 3 with a strong GY effect, making them great targets for "Cherubini's" mill. Also, it is a DARK monster, so it can be used as material for "Rusty Bardiche". "Cherubini" is DARK, so it can be used as material for "Rusty Bardiche". 
  * "[[Speedroid Terrortop]]" (with "[[Speedroid Taketomborg]]") and "[[Tour Guide From the Underworld]]" can easily bring out "Cherubini" or a Rank 3 monster.
  * Other Level 3 extenders, such as the "[[Burning Abyss]]" monsters (especially "[[Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss|Graff]]" and "[[Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss|Cir]]"), "[[Psychic Tracker]]", "[[Psychic Wheeleder]]" and "[[Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan]]", are useful for "Cherubini" or Rank 3 plays. The latter three can also be summoned with "[[Emergency Teleport]]".

  Various Rank 3/4 monsters, such as "[[Leviair the Sea Dragon]]" "[[Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss]]", "[[Time Thief Redoer]]", and "[[Evilswarm Thanatos]]" can be run due to the Deck's focus on Xyz Summoning.

  Engines that can discard cards in hand, like "[[Adventurer]]" (with "[[Fateful Adventure]]") and "[[Horus]]" (with "[[King's Sarcophagus]]") can benefit from the strong GY effects of the archetype's monsters.

  ===Sample combo===
  One simple combo starts with "[[The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales|Torn Scales]]" with any discard.

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales|Torn Scales]]" + 1 discard
  | end     = "[[The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche|Rusty Bardiche]]", 2x "[[Phantom Knights' Fog Blade]]", "Ancient Cloak" and "Silent Boots" in GY
  | steps   = 
  # Normal Summon "Torn Scales", activate its effect to send "[[The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak|Ancient Cloak]]" from the Deck to the GY.
  # Activate the GY effect of "Ancient Cloak", searching "[[The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots|Silent Boots]]".
  # Special Summon "Silent Boots" using its effect.
  # Link Summon "[[Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss]]", using "Torn Scales" and "Silent Boots" as material.
  # Activate "Cherubini's" effect to send "[[Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss]]" to the GY.
  # Activate "Graff's" effect to Special Summon "[[Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss]]" to a zone "Cherubini" points to.
  # Activate the GY effect of "Silent Boots" to add "[[Phantom Knights' Fog Blade]]" (or another Spell/Trap).
  # Activate the GY effect of "Torn Scales" to Special Summon itself.
  # Xyz Summon "[[Leviair the Sea Dragon]]", using "Cir" and "Torn Scales" as material.
  # Activate "Leviair's" effect to Special Summon "Ancient Cloak".
  # Link Summon "[[The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche|Rusty Bardiche]]" using "Cherubini" and "Ancient Cloak" as material.
  # Activate "Rusty Bardiche's" effect, setting another "Fog Blade" and sending another copy of "Silent Boots" for follow up.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As with most [[DARK]] Decks, "Phantom Knights" Decks are extremely reliant on sending their cards to the GY then banishing them from the GY to activate their effects so banishing them right away (e.g. "[[Bystial]]" monsters, "[[D.D. Crow]]", "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Dimension Shifter]]", "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]") or preventing any banishing from the GY ("[[Artifact Lancea]]", "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" and "[[Necrovalley]]") will shut them down.
  * As the Main Deck monsters have low ATK and rely on [[Special Summon]]ing, cards that punish or restrict Special Summoning, such as "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" or "[[Maxx "C"]]" can slow them down.
  * All of "The Phantom Knights" monsters are [[DARK]] monsters whose effects activate in the Graveyard, so "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]", "[[Abyss Dweller]]", "[[Consecrated Light]]" and "[[Soul Drain]]" will all effectively stop this Deck.
  * As the deck is heavily reliant on monster effects on the field, cards that negate monster effects such as "[[Skill Drain]]" and "[[Mystic Mine]]" will heavily limit the deck's abilities. 
  * The archetype does not have enough cards capable of removing or negating Spells or Traps (outside of "[[The Phantom Knights of Tomb Shield|Tomb Shield]]", which negates a Trap's effect for a turn but it needs to be sent to the GY at least a turn prior), leaving "Phantom Knights" decks vulnerable against Spell/Trap-based boardwipe cards or strategies.
