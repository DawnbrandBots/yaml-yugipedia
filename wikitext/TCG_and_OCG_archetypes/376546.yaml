  {{Quote|[[Yuto]] on the "Phantom Knights"|Phantom Knights will never fall! No matter how many times you destroy them, they will always revive!}}
  "'''The Phantom Knights'''", known as "'''Phantom Knights'''" ({{Ruby|幻影騎士団|ファントム・ナイツ}} ''Fantomu Naitsu'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] and [[Trap Monster]]s used by [[Yuto]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime and manga. It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Phantom Knights]]" archetype.

  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  The monsters visually appear to be ghostly beings, while the [[Trap Monster]]s appear to be animated armor/weapons surrounded by ghostly flames. They use the naming scheme "The Phantom Knights of {adjective} {clothing item/weapon}" in the TCG, or "Phantom Knights {adjective} {clothing item/weapon}" in the OCG, with the namesake item being featured in the artwork of each respective card.

  ===Etymology===
  The adjectives for the monsters appear to be words related to disrepair, disuse, and emptiness, while the adjectives for the Trap Monsters seem to relate to darkness, death, emptiness, and mistake. In Japanese, the archetype's kanji name reads "{{Ruby|幻|げん}}{{Ruby|影|えい}}{{Ruby|騎|き}}{{Ruby|士|し}}{{Ruby|団|だん}}" (''Gen'ei Kishidan'', lit. "Phantom Knights Order").

  ==Playing style==

  ===General===
  The "[[Phantom Knights]]" strategy heavily revolve around sending their cards to the [[Graveyard]] to net advantage by using their effects from there. Though they have other effects, the Main Deck "The Phantom Knights" monsters share a common effect of [[banish]]ing themselves from the Graveyard in order to search each other/their Spell/Trap Cards out or place each other/their Spell/Trap Cards in the Graveyard. Their Spell and Trap Cards also have effects that can be activated from the Graveyard in order to Special Summon more "The Phantom Knights", including multiple [[Trap Monster]]s, and protect these monsters from being destroyed or stopping the opponent's attacks. These plays are meant to set up the [[Xyz Summon]] of [[Rank]] 2-4 [[DARK]] [[Xyz Monster]]s, supporting them with stat-increasing and protection effects. Because some of these effects causes the "The Phantom Knights" cards to banish themselves if they leave the field, the ability to Xyz Summon using these cards circumvent this lingering effect (as using cards as Xyz Materials is not considered as those cards to leave the field), potentially allowing the cards to be reused after they have being [[detach]]ed.

  Among the Main Deck monsters of the archetype, "[[The Phantom Knights of Torn Scales]]" is by far the most important member of the archetype as it can essentially start the Deck's numerous strategies by sending a "Phantom Knights" card from the Deck to the GY, then later Summon itself back from the GY as an extender. "[[The Phantom Knights of Ancient Cloak|Ancient Cloak]]" and "[[The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots|Silent Boots]]" both search out "The Phantom Knights" cards or "Phantom Knights" Spells/Traps, and the latter can also Special Summon itself freely from the user's hand if they control a "The Phantom Knights" monster. "[[The Phantom Knights of Stained Greaves|Stained Greaves]]" and "[[The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine]]" can both Special Summon themselves easily, which can be used for Xyz Summons. "[[The Phantom Knights of Tomb Shield|Tomb Shield]]" can also situationally negate an opponent's Trap for a turn. These "The Phantom Knights" Traps all share the effects of Special Summoning themselves as monsters whenever the opponent declares a direct attack: "[[The Phantom Knights of Dark Gauntlets|Dark Gauntlets]]", "[[The Phantom Knights of Mist Claws|Mist Claws]]", "[[The Phantom Knights of Shadow Veil|Shadow Veil]]") In particular, "Mist Claws" can also Special Summon another "The Phantom Knights" Monster Card from the GY alongside itself and copies that Monster Card's level, to facilitate an Xyz Summon play by itself. "[[The Phantom Knights of Lost Vambrace|Lost Vambrace]]" can then be used to protect all "The Phantom Knights" monsters from being destroyed by battle, preserving them to have Xyz plays available.

  Among the Xyz Monsters, the Rank 3 "[[The Phantom Knights of Break Sword]]" stands as the archetype's most versatile choice which can destroy 1 card on each field, then should "Break Sword" be destroyed, it can Special Summon 2 "The Phantom Knights" monsters from the GY but with their Levels increased by one, opening a "Phantom Knights" deck to Rank 4 DARK Xyz options. While "[[The Phantom Knights of Cursed Javelin|Cursed Javelin]]" has a useful monster negate, it requires Level 2 monsters to be Xyz Summoned which must use the effects of "Lost Vambrace" or "[[The Phantom Knights of Wrong Magnetring|Wrong Magnetring]] apart from outsider cards, making it not as useful as other choices.

  Since [[Master Rule#New Master Rules|New Master Rules]], Link Summoning "[[The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche]]" is now a key play within the deck's strategy. "Rusty Bardiche" can send a "The Phantom Knights" monster from the Deck to the GY, then allows user to set one of their archetypal Spell or Trap directly from the Deck independently from "Ancient Cloak" or "Silent Boots". Afterwards, Special Summoning a DARK Xyz Monster to a zone "Rusty Bardiche" points to triggers its second effect to destroy any card on the field, allowing additional destruction on top of "Break Sword". By sending "[[The Phantom Knights of Ragged Gloves|Ragged Gloves]]", it can then send another "Phantom Knights" card from the Deck to the GY.

  The three "Phantom Knights" [[Continuous Trap Card]]s: "[[Phantom Knights' Fog Blade]]", "[[Phantom Knights' Sword]] and "[[Phantom Knights' Wing]]", all share the effect of banishing themselves from the GY to Special Summon a "The Phantom Knights" monster from the GY (but is banished when they leave the field) though "Fog Blade" can also negate a monster's effects on the field and make it unable to attack or be attacked, while the remaining two gives a monster a small ATK gain and protecting it from being destroyed. By having any of these three cards in the GY, they Special Summon a "The Phantom Knights" monster alongside "Torn Scales" for an Xyz Summon", or Summon "Break Sword" at any time to a zone "Rusty Bardiche" points to, tactically allowing "Rusty Bardiche" to destroy a card on the field at any time, as another piece of disruption.

  "Phantom Knights" can also utilize two "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" Spells: "[[The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch]]" and "[[Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force]]" which can be used to Summon stronger DARK Xyz Monsters.

  ===Other additions===
  Since the release of ''[[Phantom Rage]]'', "Phantom Knights" have received crossover support with the "[[Raidraptor]]" and "[[Xyz Dragon]]" archetypes, namely "Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Force", "[[Raider's Knight]]", "[[Raider's Wing]]", "[[Raider's Unbreakable Mind]] and "[[Raidraptor's Phantom Knights Claw]]". These made it easier to use the "Xyz Dragon" monsters (especially "[[Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]" alongside its upgraded forms "[[Dark Requiem Xyz Dragon]]" or "[[Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]").

  Other DARK Rank 4 options include "[[Time Thief Redoer]]" and "[[Evilswarm Thanatos]]" for stronger attacking beatsticks or disruption pieces.

  Other Rank 3 Xyz Monsters worth considering are "[[Leviair the Sea Dragon]]" (for Special Summoning banished "The Phantom Knights" monsters) or "[[Dante, Traveler of the Burning Abyss]]" (for potentially sending more "Phantom Knights" cards from the Deck to the GY).

  "Phantom Knights" decks strongly benefit with Link Summoning "[[Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss]]" early on due to most of their monsters being Level 3. The card can essentially send any Level 3 monster from the Deck to the GY as a cost (which most "The Phantom Knights" monsters are Level 3). Furthermore, "Cherubini" is a DARK Link 2 monster, meaning it serves as a suitable Link Material alongside one other DARK monster for Link Summoning "Rusty Bardiche".  

  Incidentally, a "Phantom Knights" Deck can make use of a variety of [[Level 3 Monster Cards|Level 3 monsters]] for Link Summoning "Cherubini" or any of its Rank 3 monsters including "[[Burning Abyss]]" monsters (espeically "[[Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss]]" and "[[Cir, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss]]"), "[[Tour Guide From the Underworld]]", "[[Junk Forward]]", "[[Speedroid Terrortop]]" (and "[[Speedroid Taketomborg]]"), "[[Kagemucha Knight]]", "[[Psychic Tracker]]", "[[Psychic Wheeleder]]" and "[[Virtual World Hime - Nyannyan]]" (the last three monsters are also [[Psychic]] monsters, allowing them to be Special Summoned from the Deck by "[[Emergency Teleport]]").

  One simple combo is to first use the effect of "Torn Scales" to send "Ancient Cloak" from the Deck to the GY, then use the effect of "Ancient Cloak" to add "Silent Boots", which can then freely Special Summon itself from the hand. Then use both "Torn Scales" and "Silent Boots" to Link Summon "Cherubini". Next, use the effect of "Silent Boots" to add any desired "Phantom Knights" Spell/Trap, which then enables "Torn Scales" to revive itself from the GY. The effect of "Cherubini" can then be used to help Summon another Level 3 monster (ie. such as sending "Graff, Malebranche of the Burning Abyss" with the effect of "Cherubini", then the effect of "Graff" can then Special Summon a Level 3 "Burning Abyss" monster). The two Level 3 bodies can be used to Xyz Summon "Leviar the Sea Dragon" which can Special Summon a banished monster that can then be used to recur a banished monster such as "Ancient Cloak" or "Silent Boots", before finally Link Summoning "Rusty Bardiche" with "Cherubini" and that Summoned "The Phantom Knights" monster.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As with most [[DARK]] Decks, "Phantom Knights" Decks are extremely reliant on sending their cards to the GY then banishing them from the GY to activate their effects so banishing them right away (e.g. "[[Bystial]]" monsters, "[[D.D. Crow]]", "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Dimension Shifter]]", "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]") or preventing any banishing from the GY ("[[Artifact Lancea]]", "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" and "[[Necrovalley]]") will shut them down.
  * As the Main Deck monsters have low ATK and rely on [[Special Summon]]ing, cards that punish or restrict Special Summoning, such as "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" or "[[Maxx "C"]]" can slow them down.
  * All of "The Phantom Knights" monsters are [[DARK]] monsters whose effects activate in the Graveyard, so "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]", "[[Abyss Dweller]]", "[[Consecrated Light]]" and "[[Soul Drain]]" will all effectively stop this Deck.
  * As the deck is heavily reliant on monster effects on the field, cards that negate monster effects such as "[[Skill Drain]]" and "[[Mystic Mine]]" will heavily limit the deck's abilities. 
  * The archetype does not have enough cards capable of removing or negating Spells or Traps (outside of "[[The Phantom Knights of Tomb Shield|Tomb Shield]]", which negates a Trap's effect for a turn but it needs to be sent to the GY at least a turn prior), leaving "Phantom Knights" decks vulnerable against Spell/Trap-based boardwipe cards or strategies.
