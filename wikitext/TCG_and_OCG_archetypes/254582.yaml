  "'''Number C'''", short for  "'''Chaos Number'''" ({{Ruby|Ｃ|カオス}}{{Ruby|Ｎｏ．|ナンバーズ}} ''Kaosu Nanbāzu'', "Chaos Numbers"), is a sub-[[archetype]] to both the "[[Chaos]]" and the "[[Number]]" archetypes. It is one of the two [[C_(archetype)|"C"]] archetypes; thus all "Number C" monsters are "Chaos" Xyz Monsters.

  == Background ==
  They are evolved forms of the base "Number", which are Summoned by [[Xyz Material|overlaying]] their base counterpart through [[Xyz Evolution#Chaos Xyz Evolution|Chaos Xyz Evolution]]. They are used by [[Yuma Tsukumo]], [[Reginald Kastle|Reginald Kastle/Nash]], [[Mizar]], [[Girag]], [[Alito]], [[Vector]], [[Number 96 (character)|Number 96]], [[Quattro]], [[Rio Kastle|Rio Kastle/Marin]], [[Dumon]], [[Trey]], [[Quinton]] and [[Don Thousand]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL]]'' manga. They are [[support]]ed by the "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" [[archetype]] and "[[Chaos Field (ZEXAL)|Chaos Field]]".
  So far, all "Chaos Number" [[Monster Card|monsters]], if they are Summoned normally rather than by Chaos Xyz Evolution, require one more material than their normal versions. The [[Number C39: Utopia Ray (anime)|first]] [[Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss (anime)|two]] "Chaos Numbers" require the same [[Attribute]] as the Attribute of their base form and necessitate the user having 1000 or fewer [[Life Points]] in order to [[activate]] their [[card effect|effects]]. The rest require a "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" [[Spell Card]], or in rare cases, another card capable of performing a [[Rank-Up]] such as "[[Don Thousand's Throne (anime)|Don Thousand's Throne]]". Furthermore, with the exception of "[[Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory]]", all "Chaos Numbers" Summoned through Rank-Up have glowing Barian energy lines running through their bodies.

  == Story ==
  [[File:Number C39V.png|200px|thumb|left|A "Number C" symbol.]]
  When [[Number holder|"Number" holder]]s have a high level of a certain emotion, "Chaos Numbers" start to appear. For example, [[Astral]] and [[Yuma Tsukumo]] obtained "[[Number C39: Utopia Ray (anime)|Number C39: Utopia Ray]]" when Astral was happy to know Yuma considered him a friend. [[Reginald Kastle]] obtained "[[Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss (anime)|Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss]]" when his desire for revenge, brought on by "[[Number 32: Shark Drake (anime)|Number 32: Shark Drake]]", overpowered him. Later, Yuma obtained "[[Number C39: Utopia Ray V (anime)|Number C39: Utopia Ray V]]" after [[Vector]] (as "Ray Shadows") gave Yuma "[[Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force]]" and their "friendship" was strengthened as a result, though this was used by Vector to get closer to Yuma. Later still, Yuma and Astral obtained "[[Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory (anime)|Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory]]" when their friendship was strengthened as a result of Yuma rescuing Astral from his own darkness.
  When Summoned without the use of a "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" card, they have the same [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] as their non-Chaos counterparts. When one is Summoned, the "Number" reverts to its neutral form and enters the [[Overlay Network]]. The Overlay Network then explodes, revealing the new neutral form, which then unfolds into the "Chaos Number".
  <div style="float:right;">[[File:Barian_Gate_Emblem.png|thumb|right|The sealed [[The Door|Barian Gate]] from which the "Number C" monsters are Summoned through [[Rank-Up]].]]</div>
  In ''Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II'', [[Barian]]s Summon "Chaos Numbers" through the use of "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" cards. As implied, the "Chaos Number" Summoned this way is 1 [[Rank]] higher than its original form. Also, unlike their non-Barian counterparts, these "Chaos Numbers" have increased ATK and DEF. "Chaos Numbers" Summoned this way have a blood-red aura surrounding them, slightly resembling electricity and glowing Barian energy lines surrounding their bodies. When someone Summons a "Chaos Number" by Ranking-Up, they enter a contract with it in order to maintain control of it, at the risk of depleting their life, such as with [[Girag]] when he Summoned his "[[Number C106: Giant Red Hand (anime)|Number C106: Giant Red Hand]]". It can also put the user at risk in case the "Chaos Number" is [[destroy]]ed, which can leave them severely injured, even on the brink of death. If a "Chaos Number" monster is Summoned via a "Rank-Up-Magic" card (except "[[Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force (anime)|Numeron Force]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force (anime)|Astral Force]]" and "[[Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force (anime)|Argent Chaos Force]]"), "[[Chaos Field (ZEXAL)|Chaos Field]]" or "[[Don Thousand's Throne (anime)|Don Thousand's Throne]]", their Overlay Units take the form of red diamond-shaped crystals as opposed to glowing orbs, and are referred to as "Chaos Overlay Units", just as with the "[[CXyz]]" monsters. The sealed "Barian Gate" appears while doing so.

  "Number C" monsters have powerful effects, though this is balanced out by their requirements - needing 1000 or less Life Points for the "Number C" monsters that have the same Rank as their "Number" counterparts, or requiring specific monsters to be [[attach]]ed to them as Overlay Units (or in the Graveyard in the case of "[[Number C101: Silent Honor DARK (anime)|Number C101]]" and "[[Number C103: Ragnafinity (anime)|Number C103]]") for Ranked-Up "Number C" monsters.

  ==Astral, Human, & Barian Chaos Numbers==
  Among the "Chaos Numbers", there are two types that can be distinguished by some characteristic. 
  * The "Chaos Numbers" that come from the [[Astral World]] have nothing unusual about them and appear neutral.
  * The Barian "Chaos Numbers" feature red energy spots on their bodies and have armored [[Xyz Material]] with red energy.
  * The "Chaos Numbers" created by humans also feature red energy spots on their bodies, but have normal Xyz Material. In addition, their color schemes are either black, gold, or both.

  == Members ==
  === Number C (Chaos Number) ===
  So far, 31 "Number C" monsters are known to exist: 21 are evolved forms of the original "[[Number]]" monsters, 2 are "Ultimate Utopia Ray" monsters (belonging to the archetype due to having a [[name condition]]), 7 are the "[[Number C10X]]" monsters, and the last is [[Don Thousand]]'s "[[Number C1000: Numerounius]]".

  === Number iC (Chaos Imaginary Number) ===
  While "Chaos Numbers" are generally Summoned by performing [[Chaos Xyz Evolution]] on a 'regular' (non-Chaos) "[[Number]]", there was a single instance where [[Don Thousand]] performed a form of Chaos Xyz Evolution on a [[Monster Card|monster]] that was already a "Chaos Number", Summoning what he called a "Chaos Imaginary Number", referencing the mathematical concept of [[wikipedia:Imaginary number|imaginary numbers]].

  Due to this card's name ({{Ruby|Ｃ|カオス}}{{Ruby|ｉ|イマジナリー}}{{Ruby|Ｎｏ．|ナンバーズ}} ''Kaosu Imajinarī Nanbāzu'', "Chaos Imaginary Numbers"), it is not a member of the "Number C" ({{Ruby|Ｃ|カオス}}{{Ruby|Ｎｏ．|ナンバーズ}} ''Kaosu Nanbāzu'', "Chaos Numbers") archetype. It is also the only "C" monster belonging to neither the "Number C" nor "CXyz" archetypes.
