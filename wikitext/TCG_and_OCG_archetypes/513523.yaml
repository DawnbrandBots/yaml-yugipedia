  "'''Malefic'''", known as "'''Sin'''" ({{Ruby|Ｓｉｎ|シン}} ''Shin'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] and [[Machine]] monsters introduced in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time]]'' movie, in which they are used by [[Paradox]]. Most of the monsters are corrupted versions of the [[signature card]]s of characters from the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'', ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'', and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, especially Dragons.

  == Anime ==
  Paradox claims that they are the most powerful cards in history, due to the fact that they are not bound to [[Normal Summon]]ing rules.

  In the movie, "Malefic" monsters were much more flexible than their ''OCG''/''TCG'' cards; multiple "Malefic" monsters could exist on the field at once, they did not impose attack restrictions, and the original monsters were sent to the [[Graveyard]] (instead of being [[banish]]ed), thus allowing Paradox to easily and constantly swarm the field with his powerful monsters. Also, the anime version of "Malefic" monsters had the effects of their original counterparts, making them much versatile.

  == Design ==
  [[File:The Sin Archetype.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Designs of "Malefic" monsters]]

  === Etymology ===
  The Japanese name for this archetype, "Sin", is meant as a pun on the words for "truth" ("shin") and "sin" ("tsumi"), alluding to the truth of human nature as seen by Paradox—that humanity's errors have led to the world's destruction.

  The English name "Malefic" means "having or asserting a negative influence", referring to how these cards are corrupted versions of existing cards.

  === Appearance ===
  Many "Malefic" monsters have mechanical-looking pieces of their body which are made of a mix of white, grey and black metal, including wings and face-plates (and, in the case of "[[Malefic Stardust Dragon]]", knee and torso plates). Their faces have masks similar to that of Paradox, with the right side black, the left side white and line patterns that cover the eyes ("[[Malefic Cyber End Dragon]]" also has its far right head black and far left white). "[[Malefic Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]" and "[[Malefic Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]" are the only "Malefic" monsters whose right eye is not covered by their masks.

  === Origin ===
  Most of the monsters in this archetype are corrupted versions of other monsters (most of which are counterparts of well-known [[Dragon]]s).

  Three "Malefic" Dragon monsters have themings original to the archetype. "Malefic Paradigm Dragon" is a Effect Monster counterpart to "Malefic Paradox Dragon", introduced in a later wave of support.

  Two "Malefic" monsters are low-Level DARK Machine "Malefic Gear" monsters. "Malefic Paradox Gear" is a non-Tuner retrain of "Malefic Parallel Gear", introduced in a later wave of support.

  == Playing style ==
  "Malefic" is an [[aggro]]-[[beatdown]] archetype, relying on high-[[ATK]] DARK monsters that were relatively easy to summon. Each "Malefic" monster based on an existing monster has the following effects:
  {{Quote|
  # Must be, or must first be, Special Summoned (from the hand) by banishing the corresponding monster from the hand / Deck / Extra Deck.
  # There can only be one "Malefic" monster on field.
  # If there is no face-up Field Spell on either field, destroy this card.
  # Other monsters you control cannot attack.
  }}

  The key monsters of the original line-up were "[[Malefic Stardust Dragon]]", which protects Field Spells from destruction, and "[[Malefic Cyber End Dragon]]", the highest ATK monster that required banishing an [[Extra Deck]] monster (meaning no [[Main Deck]] [[garnet]] needed to be run). The boss monsters include "[[Malefic Truth Dragon]]" and "[[Malefic Paradox Dragon]]", which had different summoning conditions and restrictions than the above list. "[[Malefic World]]", the in-archetype field spell, can replace the [[normal draw]] with a search for 1 of 3 "Malefic" cards, chosen randomly. 

  In the modern game, getting a single high ATK beatstick is no longer impressive. Newer support cards, released mostly in ''[[Duel Overload]]'', focus on negating the downsides of the original "Malefic" monsters, making it easier to swarm the field.
  * The most important piece of support is "[[Malefic Territory]]". It searches a Field Spell ("[[Malefic World]]"), protects Field Spells from targeted effects, replaces the "There can only be one "Malefic" monster" condition to a less restrictive one, and negates "Malefic" monsters in the Battle Phase (allowing other monsters to attack).
  * "[[Malefic Paradox Gear]]", if a Field Spell is on field, can Tribute itself to Summon "[[Malefic Parallel Gear]]" from Deck and search a "Malefic" monster, enabling the immediate summon of "[[Malefic Paradox Dragon|Paradox Dragon]]".
  * "[[Malefic Paradigm Dragon]]" can banish a "Malefic" monster from Extra Deck to summon itself. It can send a "Malefic" from Deck to GY as [[cost]] to return a banished Level 8 Synchro monster to the Extra Deck, then summon it. Requires "Malefic World" but has no other restrictions.
  * "[[Malefic Divide]]" can reborn a "Malefic" monster, ignoring its conditions and negating its effects.
  * "[[Malefic Selector]]" can banish 2 "Malefic" cards to search 2 different "Malefic" cards with different names from each other and the banished cards.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Without "[[Malefic Territory]]", the "Malefic" monsters have many inherent weaknesses. 
  ** They require a Field Spell to be present, which means that removing the Field Spell is an easy two-for-one.
  ** There can only be one "Malefic" monster on field, meaning that it's extremely difficult to [[OTK]]. An opponent, on the following turn, can easily remove the singular monster with a card like "[[S:P Little Knight]]".
  * Most "Malefic" monsters are essentially Normal Monsters on field.
  * The original "Malefics" tend to be bricks. They are useless without a Field Spell, and without "Malefic Territory", can't be summoned if you already have one on field.
  * Floodgates:
  ** Anti-Special Summon cards like "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Koa'ki Meiru Drago]]", and "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" (which also prevents searching "Malefic World"), as almost none of the "Malefic" monsters can be [[Normal Summon]]ed.
  ** Anti-banish cards like "[[Artifact Lancea]]" and "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" will prevent most "Malefic" monsters from being summoned.

  == Trivia ==
  * In the trailers shown before every episode{{fact}} are nine face-down cards. The first 5 are the "Malefic" monsters that were corrupted versions of original Dragons. The sixth is "[[Elemental HERO Neos Knight]]", the seventh is "[[Junk Gardna]]", the eighth is "[[Malefic Parallel Gear]]", and the ninth is "[[Malefic Paradox Dragon]]".
  ** All of these cards are featured prominently in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time]]'' movie. The "Malefic" monsters have also appeared in alternate versions of the ''[[FREEDOM]]'' and ''[[-OZONE-]]'' animations that used footage from the film.
  * All "Malefic" [[Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s in Japanese have their names printed in English.
  * "Malefic" monsters share some traits with two other  archetypes used by antagonists in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime; "[[Earthbound Immortal]]" and "[[Meklord Emperor]]".
  ** "Earthbound Immortal": Both archetypes consist of [[DARK]]-[[Attribute]] monsters, they are (for "Malefic", most are) [[Field-Unique]] and [[destroy]] themselves if a [[Field Spell Card]] is not present on the [[field]].
  ** "Meklord Emperor": They share an effect which prevents other monsters their user controls from attacking.
