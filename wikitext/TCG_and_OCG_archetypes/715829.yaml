  "'''Materiactor'''" (マテリアクトル ''Materiakutoru'') is a ''[[TCG]]'' [[World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[Level 3|Level]]/[[Rank 3 Monster Cards|Rank 3]] [[Dragon]] [[monster]]s introduced in ''[[Blazing Vortex]]''. Initially, it consisted of only two cards, but it received a much larger amount of support in ''[[Supreme Darkness]]'', 3 years after its first introduction.

  ==Etymology==
  "Materiactor" is a portmanteau of "material" and "reactor", with each word being a reference to both [[Xyz Material]]s and nuclear/chemical material. The names of the monsters all follow the convention of a metric prefix that is a power of 10 by a multiple of 3 followed by either a shortened [[Type]] name for the [[Main Deck]], or a mythological creature for the [[Extra Deck]], with the exception of [[Prima Materiactor]]. The names of the [[Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s are all related to nuclear or chemical reactions.

  == Design ==
  Aesthetically, the Materiactor monsters resemble bizarre alien creatures, with vibrant colors, and segmented bodies with black spikes and red lines dotted with multiple yellow eyes running through. They have a glowing mouth with a snake-like tongue biting their own tail, and glowing leaf-like structures around their body functioning as either fins and/or wings. The Main Deck monsters all resemble animals or mythological creatures based on their namesake, while the Extra Deck monsters appear to be ascended Ouroboros dragons with colors derived from their main deck counterpart, which are contained within them seemingly as a power source in [[Materiactor Annulus]]. Xyz Materials are also seen visibly circling around the Xyz and Normal monsters, with their colors corresponding to the monster's [[Attribute]], much like in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' and ''[[ARC-V]]'', and in number corresponding to the number of materials they require or represent.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Materiactor" [[Deck]] is a [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 3 strategy that synergizes with Level 3 [[Normal Monster]]s, either by Special Summoning them or being capable of applying additional effects if they are in the [[Graveyard]]. Once on the field, "Materiactor" Xyz Monsters can then be given additional material from the Deck, then use their own effects or the effects of "Materiactor" Spell/Traps to return attached materials to the hand.
