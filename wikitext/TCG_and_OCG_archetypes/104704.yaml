  '''Gadjiltron''' (ガジェル, ''Gajeru'' "Gadgel") is a sub-[[series]] of the "[[Ancient Gear]]" [[archetype]] that is comprised of monsters which heavily tie into and support the "[[Gadget]]" archetype. In the TCG and OCG, later Gadjiltron monsters lack the Gadjiltron title, however it has continued to be used for the new members that are part of the [[Ancient Gear (Rush Duel series)|Ancient Gear]] series in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel]]''.

  ==Playing style==
  A Gadjiltron deck deviates from standard "Ancient Gear" and "Gadget" decks in that it focuses on Tribute Summons in order to enable the bonus effects of the Gadjiltron monsters. Thus the deck will have an emphasis on getting "[[Geartown]]" on to the field to make the Tribute Summons easier to perform.
