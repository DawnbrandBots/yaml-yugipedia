  "'''Naturia'''", known as "'''Naturu'''" (ナチュル ''Nachuru'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] monsters from ''[[Duel Terminal]]''.
  "Naturia" monsters are composed of various Types, but all of them are related to forest life (much like "[[Sylvan]]"), such as [[Plant]]s, [[Insect]]s, [[Rock]]s, a few [[Beast]]s, and even a [[Naturia Barkion|Dragon]]. Their effects center around limiting, or gaining advantages from, the opponent's [[Spell Card|Spell]], [[Trap Card|Trap]], and [[Monster Card]]s when activated/Summoned. Despite their low ATK and DEF, "Naturia" monsters can be surprisingly quick and control the field easily.

  == Design ==
  === Extra Deck ===
  The animal-formed "Naturia" Extra Deck monsters are notable for having evolved and retrained forms. The "Naturia" Fusion Monsters are each the combined forms of two "Naturia" Synchro Monsters (evidenced either by their Fusion Materials or their visual design).

  == Playing style ==
  Almost all "Naturia" monsters have effects that can be activated in response to an action your opponent commits, thus this Deck's main strategy always revolves around control or even stun-esque approach. In fact, their main Synchro Monsters (except "[[Naturia Leodrake]]") have effects that can negate the activation of specific card types ([[Naturia Beast|Spell]]/[[Naturia Barkion|Trap]]/[[Naturia Landoise|Effect Monster]]), further reinforcing the control aspect. "[[Naturia Bamboo Shoot]]", in particular can completely blocks your opponent from activating any Spell/Trap Card (if Tribute Summoned by Tributing "Naturia" monster), thus becoming center focus in most "Naturia"-based Decks.
  Besides "Bamboo Shoot", there are also "Naturia" monsters whose effects reacts to your opponent's action regarding their monster, like "[[Naturia Mantis]]" (can destroy monsters when they are Normal Summoned), "[[Naturia Horneedle]]" (can destroy monsters when they are Special Summoned), "[[Naturia Antjaw]]" (can Special Summon "Naturia" monsters each time your opponent Special Summons), and "[[Naturia Pumpkin]]" (Special Summon another "Naturia" monster if your opponent has a monster). For defense purpose, they have cards like "[[Naturia Cliff]]", "[[Naturia Cherries]]", and "[[Naturia Beans]]", while "[[Naturia Sacred Tree]]" can improve the Deck's consistency, and "[[Naturia Marron]]" can recycle monsters.
  Their Fusion Monsters, "[[Naturia Exterio]]" and "[[Naturia Gaiastrio]]" have powerful control effects and high ATK that can be devastating to your opponent. They can be easily Summoned with "[[Miracle Synchro Fusion]]" or "[[The Earth - Hex-Sealed Fusion]]" (for "Exterio").
  Since all "Naturia" monsters are [[EARTH]], cards like "[[Giant Rat]]", "[[Gigantes]]", "[[Redox, Dragon Ruler of Boulders]]", and "[[Grandsoil the Elemental Lord]]" can be included as well.

  === Variants ===
  ==== Naturia Traptrix ====
  This variant combines "Naturia" monsters along with the suite of "[[Traptrix]]" cards. "[[Traptrix Myrmeleo]]" and "[[Traptrix Dionaea]]" are commonly used to provide more control aspect to the Deck in form of "[[Trap Hole (archetype)|Trap Hole]]" cards such as "[[Traptrix Trap Hole Nightmare]]" and "[[Time-Space Trap Hole]]", while also allowing access to plethora of Rank 4 Xyz Monsters. "Naturia" cards like "[[Naturia Cliff]]" and "[[Naturia Cherries]]" are commonly used to provide defensive capabilities while also provides Tribute fodder for "[[Naturia Bamboo Shoot]]". "[[Naturia Sacred Tree]]" is integral in this Deck, improving the consistency drastically.

  ==== Naturia Reversal OTK ====
  This Deck focuses on interactions between "[[Naturia Mosquito]]" along with small-ATK "Naturia" cards such as "[[Naturia Beans]]", "[[Naturia Cherries]]", and "[[Naturia Cliff]]", to create OTK strategy in the same way as "[[Daigusto Sphreez]]" in "[[Gusto]]" Decks. To get "Mosquito" easier, cards like "[[One for One]]" and "[[Inferno Reckless Summon]]" can be used to provide the necessary components for completing the OTK.

  === Weaknesses ===
  "Naturia" Decks, despite their capabilities of composing powerful and sturdy locks, are naturally slow. So, faster Decks usually have an easy time of exterminating them before they gather the necessary components for their lock. "[[Skill Drain]]" can single-handedly destroy this Deck, since "Naturia" monsters are so dependent on their monster effects. Most "Naturia" monsters have low ATK, so cards like "[[King Tiger Wanghu]]" and "[[Deck Devastation Virus]]" can easily prey on them.
  "Naturia" Decks focusing on "[[Naturia Bamboo Shoot]]" have even more challenges, since they need to protect "Bamboo Shoot" at all costs in order to keep their position in a Duel. "[[Effect Veiler]]" is particularly dangerous in this aspect, since it can negate the effect of "Bamboo Shoot" ''permanently'' (since "Bamboo Shoot" will "forget" that it was Tribute Summoned with "Naturia" monster if its effect is negated). "[[Solemn Warning]]" also needs to be in consideration at all times, since it can destroy "Bamboo Shoot" when it is Summoned and possibly ruin your entire strategy. Also, it is vulnerable to monster effects and monsters that have higher than 2000 ATK, so cards like "[[Safe Zone]]" that can protect "Bamboo Shoot" from both threats are highly recommended.
  "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]", and "[[Banisher of the Radiance]]" can cripple this Deck as well, since the effects of "[[Naturia Cliff]]", "[[Naturia Cherries]]", "[[Naturia Marron]]", "[[Naturia Eggplant]]", and "[[Naturia Mantis]]" become useless. "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]" can prevent this Deck from swarming, since "Naturia" monsters have different Types.
