  "'''Destiny HERO'''" ({{Ruby|Ｄ－ＨＥＲＯ|デステニーヒーロー}}, ''Desutenī Hīrō'') is a "[[HERO]]" sub-[[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Aster Phoenix]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, as well as by his [[Aster Phoenix (ARC-V)|alternate universe counterpart]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. Since their debut, they have been believed to be an anti-thesis to the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype, as specific cards somewhat resemble certain "Elemental HERO" monsters.

  == Anime ==
  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, the "Destiny HERO" monsters were designed by [[Aster Phoenix]]'s [[Mr. Phoenix|father]]. After he was killed (kidnapped in the dub), Aster inherited the cards, although [[Destiny Hero - Plasma (anime)|one]] was stolen by [[the D]].

  It was mentioned by Aster that, just like "[[Elemental HERO Neos|Neos]]" and the "[[Neo-Spacian]]s", the "Destiny HERO" monsters were infused with cosmic energies.

  The stolen card was known as the "Ultimate D Card". Aster made it his business to find this card in order to avenge his father. The "Ultimate D Card" was "[[Destiny Hero - Plasma (anime)|Destiny HERO - Plasma]]", while the "Final D Card" was "[[Destiny End Dragoon (anime)|Destiny End Dragoon]]". Aster was able to retrieve the former card after defeating the D. "Destiny End Dragoon" was initially stolen by [[Mike]] in the fourth season, but it was retrieved by [[Jaden Yuki|Jaden]] and [[Emeralda]] during a Duel that Mike organized, and was ultimately returned to Aster.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  In the ''[[OCG]]'', the names of all "Destiny HERO" monsters begin with the letter ''D'' and end with the word ''Guy''. There are a few exceptions that don't end with ''Guy'', but their names still feature the letter ''D''.

  === Members ===
  The "Destiny HERO" monsters are based on vigilantes/antiheroes (such as [[wikipedia:Batman|Batman]], [[wikipedia:Devilman|Devilman]], and [[wikipedia:Spawn (character)|Spawn]]) as well as British culture, in contrast to the American superhero-theme of the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype. There is also an emphasis on time and the future in most "Destiny HERO" card effects, as opposed to the more immediate effects of "Elemental HERO" monsters, with many having effects that trigger/resolve during the Standby Phase, interact with the top card(s) of the Main Deck, or take effect over multiple turns.

  "[[Destiny End Dragoon]]" is not a "Destiny HERO" monster, but it is a [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]] between two "Destiny HERO" monsters and supports the "Destiny HERO" archetype. "[[Xtra HERO Cross Crusader]]" also supports the archetype, and its Japanese name ends with "Guy".

  "[[Elemental HERO Phoenix Enforcer]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Shining Phoenix Enforcer]]" are also associated with the "Destiny HERO" archetype. They are named after and used by [[Aster Phoenix]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'', and their Japanese names also end with "Guy". Incidentally, the ''OCG''/''TCG''-original card "Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer" serves as the inspiration for those "Elemental HERO" cards' association with the "Destiny HERO" archetype.

  Several support and related [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s also have references to British culture.

  == Playing style ==
  "Destiny HERO" is a Fusion archetype that generally revolves around Summoning powerful boss monsters to suppress the opponent. Their playstyle focuses heavily on [[Graveyard]] effects to get enough material for their bosses. The archetype also has sub-themes of drawing cards and delayed effects (cards activating/resolving the turn after their conditions are met).

  The archetype is capable of controlling the game with endboard pieces like "[[Destiny HERO - Plasma|Plasma]]" (shuts down monster effects), "[[Destiny HERO - Dark Angel|Dark Angel]]" (shuts down the controller's Spells), and "[[D-Tactics]]" (banishes 1 card from hand/field/GY). "[[Destiny HERO - Dystopia|Dystopia]]" and "[[Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer|Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer]]" are Quick Effect disruptions. Easy access to "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" further supports this playstyle. The archetype also has some excellent protection in "[[Destiny HERO - Dreadmaster]]", "[[Destiny HERO - Dusktopia]]" , "[[Destiny HERO - Dreamer]]" and "[[D - Force]]" making their fellow "Destiny HERO" monsters untargetable and indestructible.

  The Main Deck monsters often have GY effects which help [[swarm]] the field and/or give advantage. "[[Destiny HERO - Malicious|Malicious]]" can banish itself to Summon another copy from the Deck, and is not [[once per turn]]. "[[Destiny HERO - Denier|Denier]]" can once per Duel Special Summon itself from the GY, then recycle a banished "Destiny HERO" monster. "[[Destiny HERO - Celestial|Celestial]]" can banish itself and another "Destiny HERO" from the GY to draw 2 cards, and "[[Destiny HERO - Dynatag|Dynatag]]" can banish itself to boost a "Destiny HERO" monster's ATK by 1000. Cards like "[[Fusion Destiny]]" (Fuses by sending materials from Deck to GY) and "[[Destiny Draw]]" help get the cards to the GY.

  === With other HERO archetypes ===
  <!--How other HEROs support Destiny HEROs-->
  The archetype is often combined with other parts of the "[[HERO]]" archetype, with many "HERO" cards supporting "Destiny HERO".
  * The "[[Vision HERO]]" combo of "[[Vision HERO Faris|Faris]]" → "[[Vision HERO Increase|Increase]]" → "[[Vision HERO Vyon|Vyon]]" is an excellent support for the "Destiny HERO" playstyle, since "Vyon" can search out "[[Polymerization]]" and either strategically [[mill]] or search out needed "Destiny HERO" monsters (by sending "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]" to the GY)
  * "[[Elemental HERO Stratos]]" can search for any "HERO" monster, including "Destiny HEROs".
  * "Shadow Mist", "[[Masked HERO Dusk Crow]]" and "[[Masked HERO Furnace]]" opens up the possibility for "Destiny HERO" to run the powerful "[[Masked HERO]]" monsters (mainly "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" and "[[Masked HERO Anki]]") and possibly "[[Contrast HERO Chaos]]".
  * "[[Xtra HERO Cross Crusader]]" directly supports "Destiny HERO" monsters. Upon being Link Summoned, "Cross Crusader" can Special Summon a "Destiny HERO" monster from the GY, and can Tribute a "Destiny HERO" to search out another "HERO" monster, making it useful both as a searcher and as a recovery option.

  <!--How Destiny HEROs support other HEROs-->
  On the other side of the relationship, the "Destiny HERO" archetype is one of the backbones in the overall "omni-HERO" playstyle, thanks to the [[Link Summon]] "climbing" capabilities offered by "[[Destiny HERO - Malicious|Malicious]]" and "[[Destiny HERO - Denier|Denier]]", along with "Cross Crusader's" effect to Summon from Deck. The power offered by the "Destiny HERO" boss monsters also makes them popular to include, with "Fusion Destiny" being an excellent card overall. While "Fusion Destiny" locks the player out of non-DARK "HEROs", most of the consistent "HERO" extenders and strong endboard pieces (i.e., all "Vision HEROes", "Masked HERO Dusk Crow" "Masked HERO Dark Law", "Masked HERO Anki", "Contrast HERO Chaos", and all "Xtra HERO" monsters sans "[[Xtra HERO Wonder Driver]]") are "DARK", so "HERO" can still build a competent field even if the player has to use "Fusion Destiny" as their early combo starter.
