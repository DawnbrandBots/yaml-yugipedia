  "'''Destiny HERO'''" ({{Ruby|Ｄ－ＨＥＲＯ|デステニーヒーロー}}, ''Desutenī Hīrō'') is a "[[HERO]]" sub-[[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Aster Phoenix]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, as well as by his [[Aster Phoenix (ARC-V)|alternate universe counterpart]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. Since their debut, they have been believed to be an anti-thesis to the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype, as specific cards somewhat resemble certain "Elemental HERO" monsters.
  == Anime ==
  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, the "Destiny HERO" monsters were designed by [[Aster Phoenix]]'s [[Mr. Phoenix|father]]. After he was killed (kidnapped in the dub), Aster inherited the cards, although [[Destiny Hero - Plasma (anime)|one]] was stolen by [[the D]].
  It was mentioned by Aster that, just like "[[Elemental HERO Neos|Neos]]" and the "[[Neo-Spacian]]s", the "Destiny HERO" monsters were infused with cosmic energies.
  The stolen card was known as the "Ultimate D Card". Aster made it his business to find this card in order to avenge his father.
  The "Ultimate D Card" was "[[Destiny Hero - Plasma (anime)|Destiny HERO - Plasma]]", while the "Final D Card" was "[[Destiny End Dragoon (anime)|Destiny End Dragoon]]". Aster was able to retrieve the former card after defeating the D. "Destiny End Dragoon" was initially stolen by [[Mike]] in the fourth season, but it was retrieved by [[Jaden Yuki|Jaden]] and [[Emeralda]] during a Duel that Mike organized, and was ultimately returned to Aster.
  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  In the ''[[OCG]]'', the names of all "Destiny HERO" monsters begin with the letter ''D'' and end with the word ''Guy''. There are a few exceptions that don't end with ''Guy'', but their names still feature the letter ''D''.
  === Members ===
  The "Destiny HERO" monsters are based on vigilantes/antiheroes (such as [[wikipedia:Batman|Batman]], [[wikipedia:Devilman|Devilman]], and [[wikipedia:Spawn (character)|Spawn]]) as well as British culture, in contrast to the American superhero-theme of the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype. There is also an emphasis on time and the future in most "Destiny HERO" card effects, as opposed to the more immediate effects of "Elemental HERO" monsters, with many having effects that trigger during the Standby Phase, interacting with the top card(s) of the Main Deck, or taking effect over multiple turns.

  "[[Destiny End Dragoon]]" is not a "Destiny HERO" monster, but it is a [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]] between two "Destiny HERO" monsters and supports the "Destiny HERO" archetype. "[[Xtra HERO Cross Crusader]]" also supports the archetype, and its Japanese name ends with "Guy".
  "[[Elemental HERO Phoenix Enforcer]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Shining Phoenix Enforcer]]" are also associated with the "Destiny HERO" archetype. They are named after and used by [[Aster Phoenix]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'', and their Japanese names also end with "Guy".
  Several support and related [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s also have references to British culture.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Destiny HERO" archetype includes a diverse array of Main Deck monsters and Extra Deck Fusion monsters. Their playstyle heavily involves the [[Graveyard]], with many of their monsters having effects that activate in the GY, or effects that Special Summon "Destiny HERO" monsters from the GY. The archetype has a secondary focus on drawing cards, exemplified by individual cards such as "[[Destiny HERO - Disk Commander|Disk Commander]]", "[[Destiny HERO - Celestial|Celestial]]", and "[[Destiny Draw]]". The archetype thirdly focuses on effects with a delayed activation or resolution; many of their monster effects fully resolve in the following turn after their conditions are met. Many of the earlier cards in the archetype have effects that activate or resolve during the Standby Phase.

  Generally, the archetype aims to summon their powerful boss monsters as quickly as possible to suppress the opponent's board. Their Main Deck boss monsters include "[[Destiny HERO - Plasma|Plasma]]", "[[Destiny HERO - Dogma|Dogma]]", and "[[Destiny HERO - Dreadmaster|Dreadmaster]]", while their Extra Deck Fusion boss monsters include "[[Destiny HERO - Dystopia|Dystopia]]", "[[Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer|Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer]]", and "[[Destiny End Dragoon]]". By far the most commonly used "Destiny HERO" boss monster is "Plasma", who has a one-sided "[[Skill Drain]]" effect, can remove an opposing monster by equipping them to itself, and is searchable by both "Destiny HERO" and general "HERO" support.

  The archetype is able to control the flow of the game quite well by shutting down enemy Monster Effects ("Plasma"), Spell Effects ("[[Destiny HERO - Dark Angel]]"), and even being able to deny the opponent a vital resource in their hand's cards ("[[D-Tactics]]), which is compounded by their easy access to "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]", which combos with "[[Destiny HERO - Drawhand]]" and "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" to limit the opponent's hand even further. "[[Break the Destiny]]" is even able to take away an opponent's entire Main Phase, while "Destroy Phoenix Enforcer" and "Dystopia" are able to disrupt the enemy with destruction [[Quick Effect]]s. The archetype also has some excellent protection in "[[Destiny HERO - Dreadmaster]]", "[[Destiny HERO - Dusktopia]]" , "[[Destiny HERO - Dreamer]] and "[[D - Force]]" making their fellow "Destiny HERO" monsters untargetable and indestructible.

  The GY effects of the "Destiny HERO" Main Deck monsters typically involve either [[swarm]]ing the field from the GY, and/or giving advantage to the player from the GY. "[[Destiny HERO - Malicious|Malicious]]" can banish itself from the GY to Special Summon another copy of itself from the Deck, which is not once per turn and can be repeatedly used as long as there are more copies of "Malicious" in the Deck. "[[Destiny HERO - Denier|Denier]]" can once per duel Special Summon itself from the GY, then recycle a banished "Destiny HERO" monster back into the Deck upon its Normal or Special Summon, making it useful for recycling "Malicious" for more activations. "[[Destiny HERO - Celestial|Celestial]]" can banish itself and another "Destiny HERO" from the GY to draw 2 cards, and "[[Destiny HERO - Dynatag|Dynatag]]" can banish itself to boost a "Destiny HERO" monster's ATK by 1000.

  "[[Fusion Destiny]]" is the most powerful way for the archetype to set up their GY with desired "Destiny HERO" monsters. "Fusion Destiny" can Fusion Summon a Fusion Monster that requires a "Destiny HERO" monster by sending its Fusion Materials from the Deck to the GY; because most "Destiny HERO" Fusion Monsters require generic "Destiny HERO" monsters as materials, "Fusion Destiny" can directly send 2 or 3 specific "Destiny HERO" monsters to the GY, setting up the player's GY plays. Though the monster Fusion Summoned by "Fusion Destiny" in the End Phase of the next turn, "Destiny End Dragoon" can revive itself during the next turn while "[[Destiny HERO - Dominance|Dominance]]" and "Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer" have [[Floater|floating]] effects that allow them to float into more "Destiny HERO" monsters in the GY upon being destroyed.

  <!--How other HEROs support Destiny HEROs-->
  Within the space of the entire "[[HERO]]" meta-archetype, the "[[Vision HERO]]" combo of "[[Vision HERO Faris|Faris]]" → "[[Vision HERO Increase|Increase]]" → "[[Vision HERO Vyon|Vyon]]" is an excellent support for the "Destiny HERO" playstyle, since "Vyon" can search out "[[Polymerization]]" and either strategically [[mill]] or search out needed "Destiny HERO" monsters (by sending "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]" to the GY). "[[Elemental HERO Stratos]]", being a "HERO" searcher, is always welcome for the "Destiny HERO" playstyle, and "Shadow Mist" opens up the possibility for "Destiny HERO" to run the powerful "[[Masked HERO]]" monsters (ie. "Masked HERO Dark Law" and "Masked HERO Anki").

  Within the "[[Xtra HERO]]" Link Monsters, "[[Xtra HERO Cross Crusader|Cross Crusader]]" is a direct support to the "Destiny HERO" playstyle. Upon being Link Summoned, "Cross Crusader" can Special Summon a "Destiny HERO" monster from the GY, and can tribute a "Destiny HERO" to search out another "HERO" monster, making it useful both as a searcher and a recovery option.

  Since all "Vision HEROs", "Masked HERO Dark Law", "Masked HERO Anki" and all "Xtra HERO" monsters (sans "[[Xtra HERO Wonder Driver]]") are all DARK-Attribute, the strategies surrounding on Summoning the aforementioned monsters can still be done even after "Fusion Destiny" has resolved.

  <!--How Destiny HEROs support other HEROs-->
  On the other side of the relationship, the "Destiny HERO" archetype is one of the backbones in the overall "HERO" meta-archetype playstyle, thanks to the [[Link Summon]] "climbing" capabilities offered by "[[Destiny HERO - Malicious|Malicious]]" and "[[Destiny HERO - Denier|Denier]]" . "[[Xtra HERO Cross Crusader]]" combos especially well with "Malicious" as a searcher for all "HERO" monsters. The power offered by the "Destiny HERO" boss monsters also makes them popular for other "HERO" decks to include.
