  "'''Spellbook'''" ({{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|導|どう}}{{Ruby|書|しょ}} ''Madōsho'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card]]s that [[support]] [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. Due to its Japanese name, it is a sub-archetype of the "[[Prophecy]]" archetype, with the two supporting each other. The first support was released in ''[[Return of the Duelist]]'', although 2 cards that had "Spellbook" in their Japanese names already existed before then.

  ==Naming==
  Most "Spellbook" cards are based on mystical tomes and books from history:

  ==Playing style==
  {{Main|Prophecy#Playing style}}
  Nearly all of the cards in this archetype are Spell Cards, the others being "[[Hidden Spellbook]]" and "[[Spellbook Magician of Prophecy]]". Since most support cards specify Spells, those cards do not work with them. A notable exception is the searcher "[[Spellbook of Secrets]]", however.

  Due to "Magician of Prophecy" and "Secret" searching each other out, they can be useful in Deck thinning, especially in conjunction with "[[Spellbook of Knowledge]]", which can get rid of spare "Spellbook" cards to draw 2 cards. "[[Spellbook of Judgment]]" can also be used to replenish the hand with "Spellbook" cards, and "Hidden Spellbook" to recycle those used ones for future use.

  Additionally, these cards can easily be used in [[Spell Counter]]-based Decks such as "[[Endymion]]" to create massive amounts of them.

  ===Weaknesses===
  There are many ways to shut a Deck relying on "Spellbook" cards down:
  * Card that negate, destroy, or restrict use of [[Spell Cards]] will slow or shut this deck down ("[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8]]", "[[Spell Shield Type-8]]", "[[Spell Canceller]]", "[[Great Shogun Shien]]", etc).
  * Another way to stop "Spellbook" cards is with cards that restrict searching like "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" and "[[Droll and Lock Bird]]", which can prevent the player from using "Magician of Prophecy" and "Knowledge" to get cards they need to play and "Judgment" to refill the hand.
  * "[[Eradicator Epidemic Virus]]" will completely annihilate the Deck.
