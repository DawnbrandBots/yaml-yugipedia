  "'''lswarm'''", known as "'''Verz'''" (ヴェルズ ''Veruzu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is a ''[[Duel Terminal]]'' [[archetype]] of primarily [[DARK]] [[Monster Card|monster]]s which can  be split into two sub-archetypes: "[[Steelswarm]]" and "[[Evilswarm]]". The first support for "lswarm" was introduced in ''[[Duel Terminal - Sacred Star Knights!!]]'', although "[[Steelswarm]]" cards had existed before then. They are used by [[Dark Mask of Laughter]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL]] manga.

  == Members ==
  Each "Evilswarm" monster is based on a member of a previous ''[[Duel Terminal]]'' archetype, corrupted by the "lswarm" virus that was released from "Steelswarm Cell", shown in "[[Infestation Infection]]". There is an "lswarm" [[counterpart]] for each ''Duel Terminal'' archetype except "[[Vylon]]".

  == Story ==
  {{See also|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines}}
  <blockquote>''A crisis has struck the ''[[Duel Terminal]]'' world. Nearly all living things across the planet have been corrupted, their bodies warped, and their minds slowly seized by a desire to destroy that is so strong, it becomes impossible to interact with others. The elders of the planet linked it to ancient lore of an identical plague, and so dubbed the infection, and the infected, the "Evilswarm".''</blockquote>

  "Inverz" could be seen as a shortened version of "Insect Verz" or "Insectoid Verz", meaning the "Verz" virus might have come long before the "Steelswarm" did, and the "Steelswarms" are a heavily-infected species of creature. Even the "lswarm" symbol can be seen as an outline of "Steelswarm" symbol (best seen on the horse of "[[Evilswarm Thanatos]]").

  Another possible theory is that the "lswarm" virus is a defense mechanism the "Steelswarm" implement upon extinction that works to reconstruct their race. This can be seen by the goal of the "lswarm" controlled "[[Gishki Noellia]]" being to resurrect "[[Steelswarm Hercules]]", the overlord of the "Steelswarm". It is also possible that with the destruction of the "Steelswarm" at the hands of the "[[Vylon]]", the virus then could have corrupted or even copied the other ''Duel Terminal'' archetypes.

  In addition, "Ver" is French for "Worm". This may signify that their role is similar to the "[[Worm]]s" in the previous ''Duel Terminal'' story as the first, horror movie-like antagonist ("Worms" being aliens, "lswarm" being the zombie virus), followed by a holy/unholy antagonist that at first appeared to be an ally ("[[Fabled]]" and "Vylon"). More parallels can be drawn; for example, Las Plagas (the parasitic-organism featured in both [[wikipedia:Resident Evil 4|Resident Evil 4]] and [[wikipedia:Resident Evil 5|5]]) were buried underground by a Spanish Castellan, while the "lswarms", the carriers of the "Evilswarm Virus", were sealed underground after losing against the "Vylon", also both of them can equally corrupt their hosts while making them stronger.

  == Playing style ==
  While "lswarm" supports both "Steelswarm" and "Evilswarm", the two sub-archetypes have differing playstyles.

  ===Evilswarm===
  "Evilswarm" is an archetype that focuses on swarming the field with Level 4 monsters to Summoning Rank 4 "Evilswarm" [[Xyz Monsters]].

  Key cards to help summon Rank 4s include "[[Evilswarm Castor]]", "[[Evilswarm Mandragora|Mandragora]]", and "[[Evilswarm Kerykeion|Kerykeion]]". Cards like "[[Rescue Rabbit]]" (used to bring out two "[[Evilswarm Heliotrope]]") are also helpful for this purpose.

  The Xyz monsters include:
  * "[[Evilswarm Ophion]]", which prevents the Special Summon of any Level 5 or higher monsters, which floodgated many Decks at the time.
  * "[[Evilswarm Nightmare]]", which can disrupt Special Summons by flipping the summoned monster face-down.
  * "[[Evilswarm Ouroboros]]", which can either disrupt the opponent's hand, field, or Graveyard.
  * "[[Evilswarm Exciton Knight]]", which can wipe the board as a Quick Effect if your opponent has more cards in hand/field than you. It is a generic Rank 4, so it was used as a staple until it was banned in the ''[[TCG]]'' for a few years.

  As a [[DARK]] archetype, it can run cards like "[[Dark Armed Dragon]]". It can also run "[[Chaos Zone]]", as "[[Evilswarm Salamandra]]" and "[[Evilswarm Thunderbird]]" can repeatedly rack up counters, while  "[[Creeping Darkness]]" and "[[Allure of Darkness]]" are generic [[DARK]] support that can banish DARKs.

  Due to a lack of support, the Deck was eventually powercrept; the most recent "lswarm" card is "[[Steelswarm Origin]]" (released in the ''TCG'' in 2018), with all other cards dating from 2014 or earlier.

  ===Steelswarm===
  {{See also|Steelswarm}}

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "Evilswarm" is a [[DARK]] archetype, so cards like "[[Koa'ki Meiru Drago]]", "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" or "[[Consecrated Light]]" can potentially disrupt these monsters.
  * This Deck relies a lot on "[[Evilswarm Ophion]]'s" ability to floodgate the opponent, so historically, its effectiveness varied based on how well "Ophion" fared against the metagame. While it can easily shut down Fusion, Synchro, Ritual, and some Pendulum-focused Decks, it is often useless against Rank 1-4 Xyz, Link, and Tribute Summoning-based Decks.
  ** Decks that do not rely on high-level monsters, or can take out "Ophion" without high-level monsters, such as "[[Constellar]]", are a tough matchup.
  ** A common Side-Deck card was "[[Genex Ally Duradark]]", because of its ability to easily destroy any monster in the "Evilswarm" archetype, provided they are in Attack Position.
  ** Ways to negate monsters, such as "[[Skill Drain]]", "[[Breakthrough Skill]]", or even "[[Forbidden Chalice]]" can help break an "Evilswarm" board.
  * As most "Evilswarms" have different Types, "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]" is very effective at stopping the Deck.

  == Trivia ==
  * "[[Evilswarm Exciton Knight]]" and "[[Steelswarm Origin]]" are the only non-DARK members (being [[LIGHT]] instead).
  * Every "Evilswarm" monster, except "[[Evilswarm Kerykeion]]" and "[[Evilswarm Exciton Knight]]", have an [[ATK]]/[[DEF]] value that ends with ''50'',
