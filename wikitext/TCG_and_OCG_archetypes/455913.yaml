  "'''Borrel'''", known as "'''Varrel'''" (ヴァレル ''Vareru'') in the Japanese version, is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] monsters used by [[Roken Kogami|Roken Kogami/Varis]]. The archetype is related to the "[[Rokket]]" archetype, which is also used by Varis.

  == Design ==
  With the exception of "[[Borrelcode Dragon]]" (which has more elements in common with [[Cyberse]] monsters rather than "Borrel" [[Dragon]] monsters), all "Borrel" monsters have a mechanical appearance, with [[wikipedia:Gun barrel|gun barrels]] and [[wikipedia:Revolver|revolver]] [[wikipedia:Cylinder (firearms)|cylinders]] built into them, as well as having pieces of metal armor reminiscent of [[wikipedia:Barrel shroud|barrel shrouds]].
  The "Borrel" [[Link Monster]]s are mostly colored red and dark gray, whereas the non-Link "Borrel" Monsters also have an additional coloring based on their summoning method. Additionally, parts of the names of the non-Link "Borrel" monsters are an abbreviation of their respective summoning method.
  In addition, each "Borrel" monster has a different wing color (except for the wingless "Borrelcode Dragon"): "[[Borreload Savage Dragon]]" and "[[Borreload Riot Dragon]]" share the same wing color as "[[Borreload Dragon]]", and "[[Borrelend Dragon]]" has the wings of multiple "Borrel" monsters.

  == Etymology ==
  Both the English and Japanese names of the archetype are a pun on "barrel".
