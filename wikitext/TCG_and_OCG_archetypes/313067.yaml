  "'''Mystical Beast of the Forest'''", or "'''Holy Beast of the Forest'''" ({{Ruby|森|もり}}の{{Ruby|聖|せい}}{{Ruby|獣|じゅう}} ''Mori no Seijū'') in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Beast]] monsters based on wild mammal animals that have plants growing on their bodies. They all support Beast monsters, with some also supporting [[Winged Beast]], [[Insect]], [[Beast-Warrior]] and [[Plant]] monsters. They debuted as a series in ''[[Return of the Duelist]]'', but only received their first support in ''[[Dawn of Majesty]]''.

  == Playing Style ==
  The main focus of this series is support and [[swarm]] of Beast monsters. They work really well with the "[[Melffy]]" archetype and the [[Raccoon]] series, who also focus on swarming Beast monsters. "[[Uniflora, Mystical Beast of the Forest]]" and "[[Valerifawn, Mystical Beast of the Forest]]" can [[Special Summon]] monsters from the Graveyard, while "[[Kalantosa, Mystical Beast of the Forest]]" can [[destroy]] a card on the [[field]] when it is Special Summoned by the effect of a Beast monster.

  As both "Valerifawn" and "Kalantosa" are Level 2, they can be used to [[Xyz Summon]] "[[Number 64: Ronin Raccoon Sandayu]]". "Valerifawn" is also an EARTH [[Tuner]] monster, and can be used to [[Synchro Summon]] "[[Naturia Beast]]" and "[[Naturia Barkion]]". The Mystical Beasts of the Forest can give you access to many monsters from the [[Extra Deck]], and if one of them is sent to the [[Graveyard]], you can still use "Uniflora" to Special Summon back powerful Beast monsters, such as "[[Leo, the Keeper of the Sacred Tree]]".
