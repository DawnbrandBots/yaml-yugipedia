  "'''Rank-Up-Magic'''" ({{Ruby|ＲＵＭ|ランクアップマジック}} ''Rankuappu Majikku'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card|Spell]]s introduced in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime. Their [[effect]]s allow one to [[Rank-Up]] an [[Xyz Monster]]. An Xyz Monster with a [[Rank]] higher than the [[target]] is then [[Special Summon]]ed from the [[Extra Deck]], with the targeted Xyz Monster and its [[Xyz Material]]s both becoming Xyz Materials on the newly Summoned [[Monster Card|monster]]. This process is called either "[[Xyz Evolution#Chaos Xyz Evolution|Chaos Xyz Evolution]]" (when performed using Rank-Up-Magic cards that are associated with the power of Chaos) or "[[Xyz Evolution#Rank-Up Xyz Evolution|Rank-Up Xyz Evolution]]" (when performed using other methods).
  In the Japanese version of the anime, whenever a Duelist declares the activation of a "Rank-Up-Magic" card, they do not say the phrase "I activate the Spell Card..." However, if the card is not a Normal Spell, they declare the card's [[property]].

  == Story ==
  === ZEXAL ===
  The Rank-Up-Magic cards were first introduced in the anime by [[Girag]], who used "[[Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force]]" to brainwash residents of [[Heartland]] in order to take the "[[Numbers]]" from [[Yuma Tsukumo|Yuma]], [[Astral]] and [[Reginald Kastle|Shark]]. Each time it would be used to Rank-Up Xyz Monsters into "[[CXyz]]" monsters in order to overpower the "Numbers". [[Mizar]] used it next when he himself ranked up his "[[Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon (anime)|Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]" in order to form its Chaos form. This monster wasn't fully revealed as the [[Sphere Field]] collapsed from its power. [[Alito]] and Girag both ranked up their respective "[[Number 10X]]" monsters. Both of them were defeated by Yuma and Astral (Girag was also defeated by [[Vector]] posing as Ray). In the same Duel where Girag was defeated, Yuma gained his own Rank-Up-Magic card in the form of "[[Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force (anime)|Limited Barian's Force]]" during his Duel with Girag from "Ray" but was later transformed into "[[Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force (anime)|Numeron Force]]" by [[ZEXAL II]]. Vector also demonstrated his mastery of Rank-Up-Magic cards when he used "Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force" on his "Number 10X" monster, and also to brainwash [[Brooke Walker]].
  When Yuma went to the [[Astral World]] looking for Astral, he Dueled against [[Eliphas]] who used "[[Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force]]" in his Duel against Yuma, resulting in the first appearance of "Rank-Up Xyz Evolution".
  [[Vetrix]] and [[Quinton]] researched the Barian World and managed to create "[[Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force]]". Due to it being reverse engineered from the Barian cards, its effect is weaker, only Ranking Up the monster and doing nothing else. [[Quattro]], [[Trey]] and [[Quinton]] would go on to use this card against the [[Seven Barian Emperors]]".
  When Shark became [[Nash]] (his Barian alter-ego) once again he augmented the [[Seven Barian Emperors|Barian Emperors]] with the Spell Card "[[Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One]]" which worked specifically for their "Number 10X" monsters and was used by all the Emperors except Vector. They still retained the original "Barian's Force", and Alito used it to Summon "[[Number C80: Requiem in Berserk (anime)|Number C80: Requiem in Berserk]]. Vector gained a new "Rank-Up-Magic" card during his Duel against Nash in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL - Episode 137|Episode 137]]: "[[Rank-Up-Magic Admiration of the Thousands (anime)|Admiration of the Thousands]]". During the same Duel Nash also demonstrated a new "Rank-Up-Magic" card: "[[Rank-Up-Magic Quick Chaos (anime)|Quick Chaos]]", the first "Rank-Up-Magic" [[Quick-Play Spell Card]].
  Astral's final Duel against Yuma revealed him to possess three "Rank-Up-Magic" cards: "[[Double-Rank-Up-Magic Utopia Force|(Double-) Utopia Force]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic Dark Force|Dark Force]]", and "[[Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Ultimate Force|(Hyper-) Ultimate Force]]".
  In the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (manga)|''ZEXAL'' manga]], [[Yuma Tsukumo (manga)|Yuma]] obtained "[[Rank-Up-Magic Shining Force]]" during his second Duel against [[Kaito Tenjo (manga)|Kaito]].

  === ARC-V ===
  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V|ARC-V]]'' anime, four Duelists possess the following amount of "Rank-Up-Magic" cards:
  * [[Shay Obsidian]] - 10 ("[[Rank-Up-Magic Raptor's Force (anime)|Raptor's Force]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic Revolution Force (anime)|Revolution Force]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic Raid Force (anime)|Raid Force]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic Doom Double Force (anime)|Doom Double Force]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic Soul Shave Force (anime)|Soul Shave Force]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic Skip Force (anime)|Skip Force]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic Escape Force|Escape Force]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic Devotion Force|Devotion Force]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic Limit Over Force|Limit Over Force]]", & "[[Rank-Up-Magic Battle Up Force|Battle Up Force]]")
  * [[Yuya Sakaki]]/[[Yuto]] - 2 ("[[The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch (anime)|The Phantom Knights' Launch]]" & "[[The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Burial|The Phantom Knights' Burial]]")
  * [[Kite Tenjo (ARC-V)|Kite Tenjo]] - 4 ("[[Rank-Up-Magic Cipher Ascension (anime)|Cipher Ascension]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic Cipher Pursuit|Cipher Pursuit]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic Cipher Shock|Cipher Shock]]", & "Limit Over Force")
  * [[Dennis McField]] - 1 ("[[Rank-Up-Magic Magical Force|Magical Force]]")
  "Rank-Up-Magic" cards are implied to not exist in the [[Standard Dimension]], as [[Dipper O'rion]] has stated that [[LID]] doesn't instruct people in their use.
