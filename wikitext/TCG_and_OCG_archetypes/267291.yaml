  "'''Rank-Up-Magic'''" ({{Ruby|ＲＵＭ|ランクアップマジック}} ''Ranku Appu Majikku'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card]]s introduced in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime. Their [[effect]]s allow a player to [[Rank-Up]] an [[Xyz Monster]], meaning an Xyz Monster with a [[Rank]] higher than the [[target]] (and often the same [[Type]]) is [[Special Summon]]ed from the [[Extra Deck]], with the targeted Xyz Monster and its [[Xyz Material]]s both becoming Xyz Materials on the newly Summoned [[Monster Card|monster]]. This process is called [[Xyz Evolution#Rank-Up Xyz Evolution|Rank-Up Xyz Evolution]] ([[Xyz Evolution#Chaos Xyz Evolution|Chaos Xyz Evolution]] when performed using Rank-Up-Magic cards that are associated with the power of [[Chaos (power)|Chaos]]).

  == Story ==
  === ''Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL'' ===
  The "Rank-Up-Magic" cards were first introduced by [[Girag]], who used "[[Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force]]" to brainwash residents of [[Heartland City]] in order to take the "[[Number]]s" from [[Yuma Tsukumo]], [[Astral]] and [[Reginald Kastle]]. Each time the brainwashed [[Duelist]] would use the card to [[Rank-Up]] [[Xyz Monster]]s into "[[CXyz]]" monsters in order to overpower the "Numbers".

  Later, [[Mizar]] used it to Rank-Up his "[[Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon (anime)|Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]" into "[[Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon (anime)|Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]". although this monster was not fully revealed at first, as the [[Sphere Field]] collapsed from its power.

  [[Alito]] and Girag both Ranked-Up their respective "[[Number 10X]]" monsters. Both of them were defeated by Yuma and Astral (Girag was also defeated by [[Vector]] posing as Ray). During his Duel with Girag, "Ray" gave Yuma his own "Rank-Up-Magic" card: "[[Rank-Up-Magic Limited Barian's Force (anime)|Limited Barian's Force]]". The card was later transformed into "[[Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Numeron Force]]" by [[ZEXAL II]].

  Vector also demonstrated his mastery of "Rank-Up-Magic" cards when he used "Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force" on his "Number 10X" monster, and also when he brainwashed [[Brooke Walker]].

  When Yuma went to the [[Astral World]] looking for Astral, he Dueled against [[Eliphas]], who used "[[Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force]]", which also marked the first appearance of [[Rank-Up Xyz Evolution]].

  [[Vetrix]] and [[Quinton]] researched the [[Barian World]] and managed to create "[[Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force]]". Due to it being reverse-engineered from the Barian cards, its effect was weaker, only Ranking-Up the monster with no additional benefits. [[Quattro]], [[Trey]] and Quinton would go on to use this card against the [[Seven Barian Emperors]].

  When Shark became [[Nash]] (his Barian alter-ego), once again he empowered the Barian Emperors with the Spell Card "[[Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One]]" which worked specifically for their "Number 10X" monsters. It was used by all the Emperors, except Vector. However, they still retained the original "Barian's Force", and Alito used it to Summon "[[Number C80: Requiem in Berserk (anime)|Number C80: Requiem in Berserk]]" against Yuma.

  Vector gained a new "Rank-Up-Magic" card during his final Duel against Nash: "[[Rank-Up-Magic Admiration of the Thousands (anime)| Admiration of the Thousands]]". During the same Duel, Nash also showed "[[Rank-Up-Magic Quick Chaos (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Quick Chaos]]", the first "Rank-Up-Magic" [[Quick-Play Spell]].

  During his final Duel against Yuma, Astral revealed three "Rank-Up-Magic" cards: "[[Double-Rank-Up-Magic Utopia Force]]", "[[Rank-Up-Magic Dark Force]]", and "[[Hyper-Rank-Up-Magic Ultimate Force]]".

  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' manga, [[Yuma Tsukumo (manga)|Yuma Tsukumo]] obtained "[[Rank-Up-Magic Shining Force]]" during his second Duel against [[Kaito Tenjo (manga)|Kaito Tenjo]].

  === ''Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V'' ===
  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime, "Rank-Up-Magic" cards are implied to not exist in the [[Standard Dimension]], as [[Dipper O'rion]] was surprised when he first saw [[Shay Obsidian]] use one and stated that the [[Leo Institute of Dueling]] does not instruct people in their use. It is likely given that [[Dennis McField]] also has one that they're only available from the [[Xyz Dimension]].
