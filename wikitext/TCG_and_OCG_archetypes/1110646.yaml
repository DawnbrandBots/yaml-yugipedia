  "'''Yummy'''" (ヤミー ''Yamī'') is an archetype of [[LIGHT]] [[Beast]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Justice Hunters]]''.

  ==Design==

  ===Etymology===
  The archetype's name reflects how most of the monsters are themed after sweets, but is also a pun on "darkness" (闇 ''yami''), referencing their appearance as black cats.

  ===Appearance===
  The archetype is themed around desserts. The [[Main Deck]] "Yummy" monsters resemble cute kittens cosplaying a dessert. The bottom of their artworks show the different flavors of the desserts they are based on, or the different ways they can be enjoyed. The artworks for the "Yummy" Synchro Monsters and several of the "Yummy" support cards depicts "[[Yummy★Snatchy]]" carrying various Main Deck monsters in reference to [[wikipedia:Alien abduction|alien abductions]] and [[wikipedia:Crane game|crane games]], while a crab-like [[wikipedia:UFO|UFO]] appears in several "Yummy" cards in reference to both the abduction and how the claw in a crane game is often referred to as a "pincer".

  The card "[[Yum☆Yum☆Yummys]]" reveals that the "Yummy" are in fact a plush toy crane game, and that the name of the card is the name of the toy line as a whole.

  ==Playing style==
  "Yummy" is a Synchro archetype whose Level 2 Synchro Monsters can be Synchro Summoned using Link-1 Link Monsters as material by treating them as Level 1 Tuners. Their archetypal Link Monster, "Yummy★Snatchy", can use the Synchro Monsters as interaction by triggering Synchro Summons on the opponent's turn, allowing itself to be used as Synchro Material. The Synchro Monsters can then be returned to the Extra Deck when the opponent activates a card or effect to Special Summon "Yummy" monsters from the Graveyard, many of which gain disruptive bonus effects when they are Special Summoned by a Synchro Monster's effect. Their Field Spells are modular: "[[Yummyusment☆Mignon]]" is used on the player's turn to gain large amounts of ATK and recur "Yummy" monsters for Synchro Summoning, and "[[Yummyusment★Acroquey]]" is used as additional disruption on the opponent's turn by destroying their cards or Summoning a new "Yummy" monster from the Deck. Special Summoning "Snatchy" lets the player swap them as needed; both Field Spells are capable of recycling themselves and other "Yummy" monsters, giving this archetype a good grind game.

  Because "Yummy" synergizes with cards that can quickly generate Link-1 and Level 1 monsters, many generic cards such as "[[Sky Striker]]" cards can serve to bridge into "Yummy" Synchro Monsters, which can then initiate "Yummy" combo lines. They are also generically supported by LIGHT Beast support, such as the "[[Ancient Fairy Dragon (series)|Ancient Fairy Dragon]]" series.

  If one opts to utilize a "[[Primite]]" engine in "Yummy", the ideal target is "[[Bunilla]]". This is achieved by sending "Bunilla" to GY by the effect of "[[Primite Dragon Ether Beryl]]", then using it as material to make "[[Primite Dragon Nether Berzelius]]" in the Extra Monster Zone, and finally using "Berzelius" to summon "[[Gravity Controller]]" - causing its effect to revive "Bunilla". The two can then be used to summon a "Yummy" Synchro monster.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * All "Yummy" monsters and most of the non-engine endboard piece has low ATK/DEF stats, this made them vulnerable to various easy-to-summon monsters with high ATK that can defeat them in battle, such as "[[Kashtira]]" monsters. This can be alleviated if a player has "[[Yummyusment☆Mignon]]" on the field or has endboard pieces from other themes.
  * As "Yummy" Decks relies on cycling their monsters to maintain their board presence, various anti-GY floodgates such as "[[Macro Cosmos]]" or "[[Necrovalley]]" can cripple their grind game.
