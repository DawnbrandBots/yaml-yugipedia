  "'''Nekroz'''", spelled "'''Necroth'''" ({{Ruby|影霊衣|ネクロス}} ''Nekurosu'') in Japan, is a [[Ritual Summon]]-based [[archetype]] comprised primarily of [[WATER]] monsters that debuted in ''[[Booster SP: Tribe Force]]'' with further support in ''[[Secrets of Eternity]]''.

  {{Main|Master Guide 5 card storylines}}
  ''They're a clan that perfected magical [[Ritual Summon|rituals]] to weave the power of legendary monsters into armors via a [[Nekroz Mirror|magical mirror]], and clad themselves into them. This power allows them to even control the power of the "[[Ice Barrier]] [[Dragon]]s".''<ref>[http://www.ygorganization.com/weaselstamersmagicarmorandinfernorobotsohmy/ The Organization] - New Duel Terminal World Lores</ref>

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  The "Nekroz" non-Ritual monsters are aged versions of established characters from earlier acts in the ''[[Duel Terminal]]'' storyline, associated with the "[[Gishki]]" and/or "[[Ice Barrier]]" archetypes.

  The "Nekroz" Ritual and Pendulum Monsters are the "Nekroz" non-Ritual Monsters wearing armor based on monsters from ''[[Duel Terminal]]'' archetypes (usually Synchro Monsters), including "[[Ice Barrier]]", "[[Mist Valley]]", "[[Ally of Justice]]", "[[Dragunity]]" and "[[Fabled]]". Their effects, Levels, and stat lines are often similar to their original counterparts' effects. They share their Types as their original counterparts.

  === Etymology ===
  "Nekroz" is a portmanteau of "necro" and "cloth", referring to armors based on legendary monsters. The reading of the Japanese name is spelled the same as "Necross" in "[[Exodia Necross]]"; however, the name of "Exodia Necross" does not use kanji (hence why it is not part of the archetype).

  In Japanese, the name of the archetype is written in kanji as 「影霊衣」 (with "Necroth" applied as a reading), which literally means "Shadow Spirit Cloth".

  == Playing style ==
  "Nekroz" is an archetype focused on Ritual Summoning and countering monsters summoned from the Extra Deck. This is achieved through copious amounts of searching and using Ritual Spells that allow for non-standard use of material, such as banishing from the GY or using monsters in the Extra Deck. The non-Ritual Monsters serve as conventional ritual support, [[Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz|fulfilling tribute requirements]] and/or [[Great Sorcerer of the Nekroz|fetching key cards]] to maintain consistency. The non-Ritual, non-Pendulum "Nekroz" monsters also have advantageous effects that are triggered when they are Tributed by a card effect, offsetting the costs of Ritual Summoning.

  | [[Great Sorcerer of the Nekroz|Great Sorcerer]] || Adds 1 Spellcaster "Nekroz" Ritual Monster from Deck to hand.

  |}
  "Nekroz" Ritual Monsters have Levels ranging from 3 to 11. The effects of those ones with Level from 3 to 6 are used to suppress monsters Summoned from the Extra Deck, while the effects of those ones whose Levels range from 7 to 11 give to the player more card advantage, mainly by destroying and/or banishing other cards. In addition, all of them feature a second ability that can be activated by discarding them; these effects range from protecting and empowering on-field "Nekroz" monsters to reviving them and searching for resources. This remarkable property alleviates the recurring problem with Ritual monsters becoming [[dead draw]]s when the player does not have means of Ritual Summoning them. In addition, the discard-based effects of those ones with Level from 3 to 6 are [[Spell Speed 1]], while the ones with Level 7 and above can be activated during either player's turn.
  The archetype's Ritual Monsters are all [[Nomi]] monsters that can only be Special Summoned by Ritual Summon. Additionally, all of them, save for the Levels 3-4  "[[Nekroz of Clausolas|Clausolas]]" and "[[Nekroz of Unicore|Unicore]]", have restrictions or requirements for the Tributes (or equivalent monster costs) used for their Ritual Summons:
  * Levels 5-6 ("[[Nekroz of Catastor|Catastor]]", "[[Nekroz of Brionac|Brionac]]"): Must be Ritual Summoned without using other copies of themselves.
  * Levels 7-10 ("[[Nekroz of Gungnir|Gungnir]]", "[[Nekroz of Valkyrus|Valkyrus]]", "[[Nekroz of Trishula|Trishula]]", "[[Nekroz of Metaltron|Metaltron]]", "[[Nekroz of Areadbhair|Areadbhair]]", "[[Nekroz of Decisive Armor|Decisive Armor]]"): Must be Ritual Summoned without using monsters that share the same Levels as them.
  * Level 11 ("[[Nekroz of Sophia|Sophia]]"): Must be Ritual Summoned from the hand, by Tributing 3 monsters on the field with different Types.

  |}

  Their Ritual Spell Cards are very flexible and have additional effects and conditions that help to achieve the requirements of the Ritual Summons:
  * "[[Nekroz Mirror]]" can banish "Nekroz" monsters from the Graveyard as part of the Tributes needed for the Ritual Summon;
  * "[[Nekroz Kaleidoscope]]" is a unique Ritual Spell Card, that can be used to Ritual Summon '''''any number''''' of "Nekroz" Ritual Monsters, and can send, from the Extra Deck, a monster whose Level is the same as the total Levels of the intended Ritual Monsters; this versatility helps to maintain card advantage by keeping the monsters on the field and/or hand intact;
  * "[[Nekroz Cycle]]" can Ritual Summon a "Nekroz" monster from the Graveyard, and is the first Ritual Spell that can do so.
  Each of them also have a second effect that lets the player banish it and a "Nekroz" monster from the Graveyard in order to search for any "Nekroz" Spell Card, provided its owner controls no monsters.
  * "[[Nekroz Divinemirror]]" is a Quick-Play Spell that, in addition to the hand or field, allows the use of "Nekroz" monsters in the Extra Deck (such as "[[Nekroz of Metaltron|Metaltron]]" or "[[Zefrasaber, Swordmaster of the Nekroz|Zefrasaber]]") to summon from the hand or banishment. Additionally, it is the only "Nekroz" Spell that can banish itself to search another without an empty field.

  Despite having a history as an archetype incompatible with other decks, with modern Ritual support, Nekroz has found success with the "[[Dogmatika]]", "[[Drytron]]", and more recently, "[[Voiceless Voice]]" archetypes, using a small engine consisting of "Brionac", "Clausolas", "Unicore", "Kaleidoscope", and "Cycle" to make use of "Unicore's" "Skill Drain"-like effect and recursive factors. The "Dogmatika" package is of particular note, synergising with "Nekroz" on account of both decks sending cards from the Extra Deck to the GY, using ''[[Herald of the Arc Light]]'' repeatedly to bridge between the two archetypes, while making use of "[[Dogmatika Alba Zoa]]'s" extremely powerful effects. With recent support, however, future directions for the deck can be explored.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Anti-search effect cards such as "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]", "[[Thunder Dragon Colossus]]", "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]", and "[[Mistake]]" shut down the majority of the deck's plays, with little recourse. 
  ** One can also use "[[Shared Ride]]" to take advantage of their many searching effects and gain a strong hand advantage.
  ** Despite stopping only 1 search effect, a well-timed "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" can prevent a crucial Ritual Summon. The best place to use it would be against a "Brionac"-"Clausolas" search line, which spends both of the deck's hard once per turn restrictions. With modern support, "Avance" and "Emilia" are also extremely vulnerable to her.
  * The on-Summon effect of "Trishula" has to banish 1 card from each location (hand, field and GY) and cannot be activated if the opposing player has no cards in at least 1 of those locations. Such a situation can be engineered by setting all their Spells and Traps and using all hand traps at the earliest opportunity, passing on an empty field, or not letting any cards fall into the GY, either by playing an Xyz-focused strategy and not using any detach effects, by banishing all cards in the GY. 
  * "Nekroz" Ritual Monsters are vulnerable to effects that shut down in-hand effects, such as "[[Mind Drain]]", "[[Debunk]]", etc. "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" can lock the Graveyard from the effect of the Ritual Spell Cards and the effects of "Valkyrus", "Trishula" and "Decisive Armor".
  * "Nekroz" decks rely entirely on [[Special Summon]]ing, so "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]", "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", and "[[Barrier Statue]]s" significantly hamper the deck's plays, especially with additional floodgate-style effects in play.
  ** "[[Djinn Releaser of Rituals]]" (in Nekroz format and/or [[Traditional Format]]), including their own, can shut down the deck for a significant amount of time, especially if used with "Clausolas".
  * Floodgate-style effects are often particularly difficult for "Nekroz" to stop, lacking many in-strategy ways to out them aside from "[[Elder Entity N'tss]]".
  ** Using multiple different monster types, "Nekroz" is extremely vulnerable to "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]", especially if timed correctly.
  ** "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" usually forces a pass.
  ** "[[Summon Limit]]" isn't the end of the world, though the deck can usually end on at least a "Unicore".
  ** "[[El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis]]" stops "Nekroz" decks in their tracks as its effect forbids any Special Summoning from the hand or Graveyard with Spell or Trap effects, making all of their Ritual Spells useless in the hand.
  * Cards that banish cards sent to the GY, such as "[[Dimension Shifter]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]", and "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", make it very difficult for "Nekroz" to make use of "[[Nekroz Mirror]]" and its GY search effects, cutting the deck off its main resource loop. "Shifter" is particularly notable for banishing the Ritual Spells, of which the deck usually runs one of each, and making it impossible to resolve "Trishula".
  ** "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" is particularly powerful, as in addition to this, it can banish cards "Nekroz" searches in an attempt to deal with the problem.
  ** Cards that banish from the GY, such as "[[Number 80: Rhapsody in Berserk]]", "[[D.D. Crow]]", and "[[Soul Release]]", are also effective for cutting the deck off its resources more directly.
  * Cards that negate the effects of Spell Cards, such as "[[Naturia Beast]]" and "[[Spell Canceller]]", are also major threats to this deck as they stop the deck from Special Summoning any of its Ritual Monsters (albeit they can be easily mitigated with the monster effect of "[[Zefrasaber, Swordmaster of the Nekroz|Zefrasaber]]").
  * "Virus" cards such as "[[Crush Card Virus]]" and "[[Deck Devastation Virus]]" will work well against "Nekroz" due to the fact they must discard monsters from the hand and destroy the ones they control on the field. Using "[[Eradicator Epidemic Virus]]" and declaring "Spell Cards" can rid their hand of any Ritual Spells they may have, and send any other Ritual Spells they may draw to the Graveyard.
  * The "Nekroz" strategy is very focused on countering monsters Special Summoned from the Extra Deck specifically, and has limited plays against decks that don't rely on their Extra Deck or have removal options outside it, such as "[[Kozmo]]", "[[Monarch]]", "[[Floowandereeze]]" or "[[Kashtira]]".

  == Trivia ==
  * "[[Shurit, Strategist of the Nekroz]]", "[[Great Sorcerer of the Nekroz]]", and "[[Exa, Enforcer of the Nekroz]]", are usually featured in the artworks of "Nekroz" Ritual Monsters whose Levels are divisible by their own Levels: 3, 4, and 5 respectively, the only exception being "[[Nekroz of Areadbhair]]" (10) for Shurit. "[[Dance Princess of the Nekroz]]" on the other hand, appears in the artworks of "Nekroz" Ritual Monsters whose Levels are prime numbers.
  * It seems that the "Nekroz" armors have an innate ability to affect its wearer's age; the higher their Level, the older they become, and vice-versa.
  ** In Shurit's case, he's at his oldest when he wears the armor of "Areadbhair", as evidenced by "[[Nekroz of Areadbhair]]" having the highest Level (10) among his Ritual Monster forms.
  ** In Great Sorcerer's case, he's at his youngest when he wears Unicore's armor, as evidenced by "[[Nekroz of Unicore]]" having the lowest Level (4) among his Ritual Monster forms.
  ** Despite this, it seems that "[[Dance Princess of the Nekroz]]" and "[[Exa, Enforcer of the Nekroz]]" are unaffected by this phenomenon for some unknown reason, although Exa's body mass does appear to increase in his Ritual forms, with "[[Nekroz of Decisive Armor]]" featuring an especially bulky Exa.
  * Despite "[[Nekroz of Clausolas]]" listing a "Nekroz" Spell/Trap in its text, currently there are no "Nekroz" Trap Cards.
