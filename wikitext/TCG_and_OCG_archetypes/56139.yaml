  "'''Fabled'''", known as "'''Demon Roar God'''" ({{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|轟|ごう}}{{Ruby|神|しん}} ''Magōshin'') in the ''[[OCG]]'' and as "'''Fiend Roar Deities'''" in some video games, is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] and [[Beast]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] (with the Beast monsters being titled as "The Fabled" to distinguish them) began in Japan as Duel Terminal Promos in ''[[Duel Terminal - Demon Roar God Revival!!]]'' and continued in ''[[Duel Terminal - Champion of Chaos!!]]''. Their effects focus on [[discard]]ing cards from their controller's hand to the [[Graveyard]] to activate their effects.
  ==History==
  {{Main|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines#The "Fabled" Tribe Revives}}
  ==Appearance==
  "Fabled" monsters are depicted in a manner as to display both a hallowed aspect to them and a bit of whimsy, however, overall their art is meant to give the impression of a slanted kind of twisted, be it "demonic" or cynical. All of them are LIGHT monsters, and are believed to represent heterodoxy, perverse versions of "light", and degradation from grace and dignity, with some resembling the archetypal Fallen Angels from the Bible. They all have masks, which makes them resemble monsters of certain Spanish legends. Tiny colorful and malicious imps often accompany monsters in their background art.

  ==Playing style==
  They are similar to the "[[Dark World]]" archetype in that the Monsters thrive off of effects that [[discard]]; however, unlike Dark World, all "Fabled" Monsters will benefit off of ''any'' discard, even for [[cost]]. Even though cards like "[[Dark World Dealings]]" can be used with "Fabled" monsters, it's best to keep a high monster count, and use their own effects to Special Summon them. The archetype also greatly benefits from cards like "[[Tour Guide From the Underworld]]", which gets "Kushano" to the grave as quick as possible, and sets up for [[Rank]] 3 [[Xyz Monster]]s, such as "[[Leviair the Sea Dragon]]". Though these Xyz support the deck, the main focus is Synchros, such as "[[Fabled Ragin]]", "[[Formula Synchron]]" and "[[T.G. Hyper Librarian]]", in order to maintain the card advantage lost by summoning those monsters. 
  "Fabled" Decks can be very versatile. Because of their potential to abuse special summons and also being a LIGHT Fiend archetype, there are a lot of cards to support them.  The key to a successful Deck is to control the field while slowly gaining advantage for powerful finish. 
  "[[Beckoning Light]]" is by far the best tool in "Fabled" arsenal. It lets you discard your Fabled monsters while getting another ones from your Graveyard. 
  Both "[[Phoenix Wing Wind Blast]]" and "[[Raigeki Break]]" are really handy for this deck, letting you to disrupt your opponent's plays and discard a "Fabled" Monsters. By combining them with "[[The Fabled Catsith]]", you get a powerful removal tool.
  Another way around is to add T.G engine ("[[T.G. Warwolf]]" and "[[T.G. Striker]]") and focus on a Beast support (like "[[Horn of the Phantom Beast]]") to make a good use of The Fabled sub-series.
  With the changes brought by [[Link Monster]]s and Master Rule 4, the sheer swarming ability of this archetype allows for rapid Link and Synchro summons. As time goes on more Link monsters will be printed that indirectly support "Fabled" cards.

  ===Weaknesses===
  "[[Silent Graveyard]]", "[[Soul Drain]]" and/or "[[Abyss Dweller]]" alone can severely slice into "Fabled"s  because such monsters whose effects activate when discarded transpire ''while'' they're in the Graveyard. This archetype's [[Attribute]] of LIGHT can also be capitalized on via "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]". A substantial count of "Fabled"s on the roster also have superficial [[ATK]], making them prey for cards like "[[King Tiger Wanghu]]" and "[[Deck Devastation Virus]]", which can plug up Synchro Summons by putting away key Tuners like "Cerburrel", "Rubyruda" and "Chawa".
  "[[Skill Drain]]" and "[[Mind Drain]]" can be used against any "Fabled"s with effects that respectively activate on the [[field]] or in the [[hand]] (i.e "Grimro" and "Nozoochee" in the Hand.)
  "[[Goblin of Greed]]" can also impede "Fabled"s because it will restrict them from being discarded as a [[cost]], hence making it more laborious to use them.
