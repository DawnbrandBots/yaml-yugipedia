  "'''Forbidden One'''", known as "'''Sealed'''" ({{Ruby|封|ふう}}{{Ruby|印|いん}}されし ''Fūinsareshi'') in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Spellcaster]] monsters. Each of the five monsters represents a body part of "[[Exodia the Forbidden One]]", which can grant the player an automatic [[victory condition]] when gathered in the player's [[hand]]. They were used by [[Yugi Muto]], [[Yami Yugi]], [[Seeker]], and [[Gozaburo Kaiba]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]], and [[Yubel (character)|Yubel]] (while possessing [[Marcel Bonaparte]]) and [[Adrian Gecko]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. 

  The "Forbidden One" cards are some of the most iconic cards in the franchise, being well known for their automatic win condition and Yugi's usage of them during [[Yami Yugi and Seto Kaiba's first Duel]] in the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' manga and anime.

  == Lore ==
  [[File:ExodiaTablet.jpg|left|thumb|300px]]
  "Exodia" was, at first, a beast of such incalculable and intimidating might that he was split up into five distinctive parts, each one of them chained and sealed away by magic from all the other monsters (hence "the Forbidden One"). This way, his power was prevented from ever being used again.

  As a result, in the ''Yu-Gi-Oh'' card game, there are five distinct "Forbidden One" cards, each one symbolizing a part of the complete "Exodia". In order for "Exodia" to be Summoned, the player must gather all the five parts into their hand. This brings the parts of the "Forbidden One" together, allowing "Exodia" to come forth, his strength being so great that he guarantees the player an automatic win, regardless of the situation.

  The effect of "Exodia" makes it one of the most unusual monsters in ''Duel Monsters''; its effect doesn't rely on ATK and DEF or even being on the field at all in order to activate, instead causing an immediate victory when all five cards are assembled in the hand.

  In the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' manga and anime, [[Shimon]] used Exodia against [[Zorc Necrophades]], against whom he was equal; however, "Exodia" was defeated because he drew his power from Shimon, a single mortal man, whereas Zorc had his own power source.

  == Origin ==
  Exodia's backstory and pharaoh-like appearance likely references the Egyptian legend of [[wikipedia:Osiris|Osiris]], god of death, rebirth, and judgment. In the legend, Osiris was the god Egyptians believed brought them civilization, such as the knowledge of architecture, farming, and establishing the line of pharaohs. However, Osiris was betrayed by his jealous brother [[wikipedia:Set (mythology)|Set]] and was cut into several pieces, which were then scattered across Egypt. Osiris' wife [[wikipedia:Isis|Isis]] recovered the pieces and brought Osiris back to life long enough for them to bear a son, [[wikipedia:Horus|Horus]], before Osiris departed to the Land of the Dead where he became its ruler.

  Exodia's iconic "obliterate" attack references "Revelation 20:7-9" in the Bible, in which Satan's army is instantly decimated by a flame cast by God. This is once again referenced during the battle with Zorc when Exodia is described as having defeated an army of thousands in a single night. Exodia then lives up to his title by instantly vaporizing Zorc's undead army. This scene only appears in the manga. In the anime, Exodia never engages Zorc's army and instead fights Zorc immediately.

  {{main|Exodia}}

  The primary purpose of "Exodia" is to declare an automatic win through the effect of "[[Exodia the Forbidden One]]". This is done either by drawing/searching many times ([[Exodia OTK]]) or by delaying the opponent from winning ([[Stall]]).

  However, many "Exodia" support cards have been released over the years, allowing the "Forbidden One" pieces to be used in other ways. Examples include "[[Exodia Necross]]", "[[Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord]]", and "[[The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate]]". These cards either have alternate win conditions of their own (e.g. "Exodius" wins when all 5 Forbidden One pieces are in the GY), or act as tough boss monsters to help win by regular means.

  == Anime ==
  === ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' ===
  ==== Duelist Kingdom arc ====
  [[File:ANIME-Exodia-Cards.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Weevil Underwood]] holding all 5 pieces of Exodia, as given to him by Yugi during [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 003|episode 3]].]]
  In the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|second anime series]], the "Exodia" cards were, according to Yugi, an "experiment" by the creators of the game, and was notable for never successfully being played until Yami Yugi was able to assemble all five pieces during his Duel against [[Seto Kaiba]] in {{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|001|ref}}. Afterwards, "[[Exodia the Forbidden One (character)|Exodia]]" appeared on the field and launched an attack powerful enough to simultaneously wipe out all of Kaiba's "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragons]]", allowing Yugi to win the Duel.

  However, in {{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|003|ref}}, during Yugi Muto's boat trip to [[Duelist Kingdom]], [[Weevil Underwood]] threw them overboard to ensure that Yugi couldn't use them for the tournament; despite the best efforts of [[Joey Wheeler]], only two pieces were recovered, but Yugi has never used the "Exodia" cards again.

  ==== Battle City arc ====
  Before the beginning of Kaiba's [[Battle City]] tournament, Seeker of the [[Rare Hunters]] used "Exodia" to defeat Joey Wheeler and take his "[[Red-Eyes B. Dragon (anime)|Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]". In the Duel against Yami Yugi that followed the beginning of the tournament, Seeker was about to draw the "[[Left Arm of the Forbidden One (anime)|Left Arm of the Forbidden One]]" when Yugi prevented his draw by using "[[Time Seal (anime)|Time Seal]]" Later, Seeker was defeated when Yugi destroyed every copy of "[[Exodia the Forbidden One (anime)|Exodia the Forbidden One]]" in his Deck using "[[Chain Destruction (anime)|Chain Destruction]]." Following that, Yugi ripped up the "Forbidden One" cards as they were [[counterfeit]]s (in the English dub, he did that since the "Forbidden One" cards were marked with invisible ink so the Rare Hunter knew when he would draw one).

  ==== Virtual World arc ====
  Gozaburo Kaiba used an Exodia Deck against Seto Kaiba, and believed that since Yugi had defeated Kaiba with "Exodia", Kaiba would fear it. Instead of collecting the various "Forbidden One" monsters in his hand, Gozaburo sent them to his Graveyard so he could Summon "[[Exodia Necross]]"; however, Kaiba was able to overcome his fears and saw the weakness in "Exodia Necross", and so he [[banish]]ed the "Forbidden One" monsters in the Graveyard using "[[Soul Demolition (anime)|Soul Demolition]]", and thus rendered "Exodia Necross" powerless.

  "Exodia Necross'" effect was marginally different in the anime. It gained a different effect for each "Exodia" piece in the Graveyard. It became immune to Spell and Trap Card effects when the "Left Leg" and "Right Leg" were each in the Graveyard; it became immune to [[Monster Card]] effects if the "Left Arm" was in the Graveyard; it gained 1000 [[ATK]] during [[damage calculation]] if the "Right Arm" was in the Graveyard; and it couldn't be destroyed by battle if "Exodia the Forbidden One" was in the Graveyard.

  ==== Dawn of the Duel arc ====
  Exodia makes one final appearance in {{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|216|ref}} as the [[Ka]] spirit of [[Shimon Muran]]. Shimon had sealed "Exodia" a long time ago away due to its godly strength, but released him to engage in battle with [[Zorc Necrophades]]. Despite a strong effort, "Exodia" was defeated by Zorc, because "Exodia" drew his power from Shimon, while Zorc used the power of the darkness. Initially, both of them seemed imperishable, but as "Exodia's" life force was drawn from Shimon, any damage caused to "Exodia" was also caused to Shimon himself, and Shimon, a sole mortal, wasn't able to stand up to the power of Zorc. This allowed the demon to easily cleave "Exodia" in half, killing Shimon in the process.

  === ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' ===
  During the third season of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, "Exodia" was used by two separate Duelists.

  The first was Marcel Bonaparte, who was possessed by the spirit of Yubel, which he used during his Duel against Adrian Gecko. Using the effect of "[[Mad Reloader (anime)|Mad Reloader]]", he drew the "Forbidden One" Normal Monsters. He intended to the effect of two "[[Break the Seal]]" to send them to the Graveyard and add "Exodia the Forbidden One" to his hand, but at that time, the [[Sacred Beast]]s awakened, forcing them to end the Duel.

  Later in the season, Adrian discovered the seal of "Exodia" in the third alternate dimension and realized that he must sacrifice the Duel Energy of someone close to him in order to free "Exodia". Adrian decided to sacrifice [[Echo]], whom he loved, but was opposed by [[Aster Phoenix]]. The two Dueled and Aster was able to block Adrian from achieving the victory condition of "Exodia" using "[[Force of Four]]." Adrian, however, made a comeback using "[[Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord (anime)|Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord]]". Echo willingly sacrificed herself to release "Exodia", and despite Aster coming close to victory, Adrian was able to Summon "Exodia" by using the victory condition of "Exodius".

  Adrian later used his Exodia Deck against [[Jesse Anderson]] (possessed by Yubel) in order to become the king of the third alternate dimension. Adrian was defeated when his opponent Summoned "[[Yubel (anime)|Yubel]]", whose effect defeated him as she attacked "[[Torch Golem (anime)|Torch Golem]]". Adrian would have won during his next turn, as he had four different "Forbidden One" monsters in his hand and was about to draw the fifth, which was placed on top of his Deck by using "[[A Feather of the Phoenix (anime)|A Feather of the Phoenix]]".

  In the anime, the effect of "Exodius" effect was marginally different. It needed be Summoned via "[[Ritual of the Ultimate Forbidden Lord]]" and was immune to card effects controlled by the player's opponent. Rather than gaining ATK for Normal Monsters in the Graveyard, it gained ATK only for "Forbidden One" monsters in the Graveyard, and it could only send "Forbidden One" monsters from the Deck or hand to the Graveyard when it attacked.

  === ''Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's'' ===
  In the English dubbed version of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, [[Yusei Fudo]] compared the "[[Earthbound Immortals]]" to "Exodia", though he was likely using the size and similar body shapes of "Exodia" and "[[Earthbound Immortal Ccapac Apu (anime)|Earthbound Immortal Ccapac Apu]]" as his main comparison.

  == Video games ==
  === ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum'' ===
  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum]]'', the player could fuse the five pieces of "Exodia" to Summon "[[The Legendary Exodia Incarnate]]", the complete Exodia, (but it will be only like a normal fusion piece) with an ability to cause massive damage on the monsters that was in range, that was known by "Obliterate".

  === ''Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses'' ===
  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses]]'', "[[Summoned Lord Exodia]]" could be unlocked in the Library when the player successfully Summoned Exodia, but it was impossible to see him in 3D, and the only available statuses were his [[Type]], which is [[Spellcaster]], and his [[Attribute]], which is [[DARK]].

  == Trivia ==
  * The chance of drawing all 5 pieces of Exodia in the first five cards out of a 40 card deck is 1/658008, if there is 1 of each piece, as there is (5/40 * 4/39 * 3/38 * 2/37 * 1/36 = 1.52*10^-6 or 0.000152%).
  * In the TCG, "Exodia the Forbidden One" is one of the first five [[Effect Monster]]s ever to be released and the first card to have an alternative [[victory condition]]. 
  ** In the OCG, "Exodia the Forbidden One" was the twenty-third Effect Monster to be released, following [[Armed Ninja]], [[Cocoon of Evolution]], [[Cockroach Knight]], [[Dark Artist]], [[Electric Lizard]], [[Goddess of Whim]], [[Hane-Hane]], [[Harpie Lady Sisters]], [[Hourglass of Courage]], [[Karakuri Spider]], [[Magician of Faith]], [[Man-Eater Bug]], [[Mask of Darkness]], [[Patrol Robo]], [[Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth]], [[Reaper of the Cards]], [[Skelengel]], [[Steel Scorpion]], [[Swordsman from a Distant Land]], [[The Wicked Worm Beast]], [[Time Wizard]], [[Wodan the Resident of the Forest]], and [[Zone Eater]].
  ** The "Forbidden One" cards were the only monsters ever specifically mentioned in the rulebooks (other than as an example), due to "Exodia the Forbidden One" being the only card with an alternative victory condition at the time. "Exodia the Forbidden One" is no longer mentioned in the rulebook, as its [[card text]] suffices to clarify its effect.
  * In the ''[[TCG]]'' artwork, the pentagram seal behind the "Forbidden One" monsters are replaced by "[[Spellbinding Circle]]".
