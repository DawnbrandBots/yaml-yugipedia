  "'''Inzektor'''" ({{Ruby|甲虫装機|インゼクター}} ''Inzekutā'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Insect]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] which was introduced in ''[[Order of Chaos]]''. Most "Inzektor" monsters [[equip]] themselves with other "Inzektor" monsters from the [[hand]] or [[Graveyard]], or have effects that [[trigger]] when they are equipped to one.
  == Appearance ==
  The "Inzektor" monsters appears to be humanoids wearing various insect-styled armor. They also seem to be heavily inspired by the ''[[wikipedia:Kamen Rider|Kamen Rider]]'' franchise.
  == Etymology ==
  Each "Inzektor" monster is named after a type of arthropod, with a wide variety ranging from ants to hornets to stag beetles.

  == Playing style ==
  "Inzektor" is a potentially powerful, aggressive archetype that can possibly [[OTK]] with the right starting hand and build a strong field. "Dragonfly" and "Centipede" are two of the most important members of the archetype, as they allow for constant [[Special Summon]]s straight from the [[Deck]] and searching for other "Inzektor" monsters from the Deck naturally, as these effects can be used whenever an equipped card is sent from the [[field]] to the GY. Combined with "Hornet" who can [[destroy]] multiple cards a turn if recycled and played at 3 copies. "Ladybug" can help out with activating the effects of "Dragonfly" and "Centipede" as well, while also manipulating [[Level]]s for [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] and even some [[Synchro Monster]]s if necessary. Another good pair of monsters are "Giga-Mantis" and "Giga-Weevil", which allow for more [[swarm]]ing and in the case of "Giga-Mantis", a healthy [[ATK]] boost of 2400 while "Giga-Weevil" provides a [[DEF]] boost of 2600 though both are worth using if one wants to utilize more of their GY more often. "Earwig" is another choice for stat manipulation though it only provides an additional 1000 ATK while equipped and when sent to the GY applies another 1000. "Firefly" may provide some use as it can allow you to view all your opponent's [[Set]] cards which may not prove as impactful as one may hope along with the subpar 100 ATK/DEF boost it provides. "Ant" in comparison is more defensive as it can destroy itself to keep the equipped monster alive similar to [[Union Monster]]s. "Hopper" can allow the equipped monster to attack directly but prevents others from battling. "Giga-Cricket" on the other hand makes the equipped monster's [[original ATK]] 2000 and gives it the ability to inflicting piercing battle damage to the opponent however, this comes at the cost of potentially draining resources one would be using in combination with "Giga-Mantis" and "Giga-Weevil". The [[Extra Deck]] members consists of the Xyz duo of "Ex-Stag" and "Exa-Beetle" and the [[Link Monster]] "Picofalena"; "Exa-Stag" can serve as a non-destruction out to many monsters while gaining a potentially huge ATK boost by equipping them, while "Exa-Beetle" can equip an "Inzektor" from the GY upon being [[Xyz Summon]]ed and destroys a card on both fields, triggering the effects of the earlier mentioned "Dragonfly" and "Centipede" if any combination of the two or all three are present at the same time. "Picofalena" on the other hand, equips a monster straight from the Deck when it is [[Link Summon]]ed at the cost of a [[discard]] which provides an okay 500 ATK/DEF boost, this easily using multiple copies of "Hornet" in a turn. "Picofalena" can also easily recycle resources, shuffling three of your Insect monsters from the GY into your Deck and drawing a card. As a result, "Picofelana" is a valuable asset. The related Synchro monster "[[Powered Inzektron]]" doesn’t follow the theming of the Deck, instead simply making itself immune to destruction and preventing you from taking damage the turn it is [[Synchro Summon]]ed.
  The archetype's [[Spell]]/[[Trap]] line-up naturally plays along with the equip theming. "Armor Blast" can easily clear the opposing field of two cards for the cost of one of your "Inzektor" cards, again potentially synergizing well with other cards in the Deck. "Final Inzektion" is a costly nuke card that requires sending 5 "Inzektor" cards from your field to the GY and locking the opponent out of card effects during the [[Battle Phase]] that turn. There are also 3 [[Equip Spell]]s within the archetype; "Inzektor Axe - Zektahawk", "Inzektor Sword - Zektkaliber" and "Inzektor Crossbow - Zektarrow". "Zektarrow" provides 500 ATK and makes the opponent unable to respond to the equipped monster's effects, "Zektahawk" provides 1000 ATK and locks the opponent out of using Spells/Traps when the equipped monster battles, and "Zektkaliber" which instead provides 800 ATK/DEF while also letting one retrieve used "Inzektor" monsters from the GY. "Variable Form" is a [[Continuous Trap]] that can help with equipping "Inzektor" monsters to each other OR Special Summoning equipped monsters. "Zekt Conversion" is a unique form of attack negation in that it equips the targeted "Inzektor" and taking control of it, which if used right can catch you a powerful ally. "Inzektor Orb" is a Trap that can equip itself to a monster, provide 500 ATK/DEF and sacrifice itself to negate a card effect targeting the exactly 1 "Inzektor" monster. "Inzektor Gauntlet" instead provides 1000 DEF and prevents your monster from being destroyed by card effects.
  Cards like "[[Howling Insect]]" and "[[Armageddon Knight]]" can help with gathering up everything needed to start your plays. "[[Parasite Paranoid]]" and "[[Cocoon of Ultra Evolution]]" can also be helpful due to their own equip-based effects, on top of "[[Insect Imitation]]" being able to help rid the field of problematic monsters an oppponent may have by quickly getting out key "Inzektor" monsters. "[["C"]]" cards can be used in tandem with the Deck, especially with cards like "[[Giant Ballpark]]" and "[[Gokipole]]". One may also want to look into Xyz Monsters of various [[Rank]]s due the sheer amount of Level manipulation the archetype has.

  === Weaknesses ===
  "[[Effect Veiler]]", "[[Fiendish Chain]]" and "[[Skill Drain]]" will easily stop "Inzektor Dragonfly", "Centipede" and "Ladybug" from using their equip effects in the first place. "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" can shut this Deck down, since there will be no way of equipping "Hornet". They also depend on being able to [[Normal Summon]] "Dragonfly" or "Centipede", so "[[Book of Moon]]" and "[[Trap Hole]]" [[stall]] the engine even just for a turn. Since the majority of their strength comes from "Hornet", "[[D.D. Crow]]" and [[Macro]]-based Decks in general cause problems. "[[Chain Disappearance]]" is also a detriment to this Deck since it can banish both "Hornet" and "Dragonfly", as well as "Ladybug". Virus cards such as "[[Deck Devastation Virus]]" also make it difficult to use this Deck, since most of the low-Level members have an ATK lower than 1500. Also, since this deck relies on its setup for preparing its own bombardment tactics via "Hornet", an [[OTK]]-based Deck such as "[[Hieratic]]" can usually take down this one before they can even get their setups going. Since "Centipede" is a crucial card in most practically all "Inzektor" builds, cards like "[[Bottomless Trap Hole]]" and "[[Chaos Trap Hole]]" are effective for dispatching "Centipede". "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" can also stop its Deck searching effect (assuming "Hornet" does not destroy it first).
  Finally because of the fact that the "Inzektor" monsters equipped to other monsters are treated as Equip Cards, giving way to certain abilities, cards like "[[Dark Highlander]]", "[[Eternal Rest]]", "[[Really Eternal Rest]]", "[[Tailor of the Fickle]]", "[[The Emperor's Holiday]]", "[[Disarmament]]", "[[Armored Glass]]", "[[Armor Break]]" and "[[Collected Power]]" can knock off their abilities on the Field.
  == Trivia ==
  * This archetype is similar to "[[Dragunity]]" and "[[Vylon]]" in that they equip with themselves in order to gain various effects.
