  "'''Void'''", known as "'''Purgatory'''" ({{Ruby|煉|れん}}{{Ruby|獄|ごく}}, ''Rengoku'') in the Japanese version, is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s. The first support for which was introduced in ''[[Crossed Souls]]''.
  There are two distinct themes among "Void" cards: Spells and Traps that support the "[[Infernoid]]" archetype, and cards that support the "[[Infernity]]" archetype (which were used by [[Kalin Kessler (manga)|Kalin Kessler]] in the manga). There are also two members that do not specifically support either archetype: "[[Into the Void]]" and "[[Void Trap Hole]]"; however, "Into the Void" features "Infernity" cards in its artwork and fits into their playstyle.

  "[[Unformed Void]]" is not a "Void" card because its Japanese name does not contain 「{{Ruby|煉|れん}}{{Ruby|獄|ごく}}」. In addition, due to the opposite reason, "[[Blast Magician]]" is also a member of this archetype. However, because ''TCG''/''OCG'' support for this archetype only works on [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s, this is not an issue, unless they are treated as Spell or Trap Cards (such as by the effect of "[[Relinquished]]" or "[[Psychic Megacyber]]").

  ==Members==
  ===Supports Infernoid===
  The Japanese names of every "Infernoid"-supporting "Void" card includes wordplays involving replacing ''kanji'' characters in two-character words with homophonous, purgatory-related characters. For example, the Japanese name of "[[Void Imagination]]", 「煉獄の虚夢」, contains 「虚夢」 (''Kyomu'', literally "Void Dream"), a homophonous nonce word based on 「虚無」 (''kyomu'', "emptiness").
