  "'''Inmato'''", known as "'''Tomabo'''" (トマボー) in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Plant]]-Type [[Monster Card|monsters]]. "[[Cherry Inmato]]" can be used to [[Special Summon]] "Inmato" monsters from your [[Main Deck|Deck]] while "[[Inmato]]" can be used to [[Draw a card|draw]] more cards. Those monsters can also be Special Summoned with "[[Mystic Tomato]]", which is also a tomato-based DARK Plant-Type monster. The archetype can be organized into a [[Toolbox]] that allows for quick [[Level]] 5 or 6 [[Synchro Summon]]s, draw power, and [[field]] presence.
