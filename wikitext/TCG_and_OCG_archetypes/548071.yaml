  "'''Sunavalon'''", known in Japanese as "'''San Avalon'''" (サンアバロン ''San'abaron''), is an [[archetype]] of [[Plant]] [[Link Monster]]s used by [[Spectre]]. They are supported by the "[[Sunvine]]" archetype and related to the "[[Sunseed]]" archetype.
  "Sunavalon" were a candidate to be released in ''[[Collection Pack 2020]]'' and received 23.5% of votes in the poll, coming in second place. While they did not qualify for release in ''Collection Pack 2020'', they were released later that same year in ''[[Selection 10]]''.
  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  The "Sunavalon" monsters have appearance of a giant tree with several fruits hanging from its branches. These fruits burst forth whenever they activate their effects to summon "Sunvine" Link Monsters monsters from the [[Extra Deck]], from which the "Sunvine" monster emerges. On the center of the trunk is a face which is revealed to have a Dryad-like creature inside.
  ===Etymology===
  "Sunavalon" is written with the kanji for "Sacred Heavenly Tree". The archetype name is a reference to [[wikipedia:Avalon|Avalon]], a legendary island featured in the Arthurian legend whose name literally means "the isle of fruit trees". The name is generally considered to be of Welsh origin, derived from Old Welsh ''aball'' or ''avallen'', which means "apple tree" or "fruit tree" respectively. These words may be derived from the Common Celtic word ''abalnā'', which literally means "fruit-bearing thing", similar to how the "Sunavalon" monsters 'bear' the "Sunvine" monsters within their fruits. The members of this archetype are also named after characters from Greek mythology:

  ==Playing style==
  "Sunavalon" revolves around controlling/swarming the field with Link Monsters, which have low ATK but defensive effects / effects that trigger when damaged. The most basic play is to summon "[[Sunseed Genius Loci]]", use it as Link Material for "[[Sunavalon Dryas]]" to search "[[Sunvine Sowing]]" (or another archetypal Spell/Trap), then using that for further Link plays. Due to the high swarming capabilities, the archetype allows the user to also maintain great hand advantage as well. It is often played alongside other [[Plant]] archetypes, such as "[[Rikka]]".

  Since "Genius Loci" is a Normal Monster, it benefits from various Normal Monster support cards, such as "[[Unexpected Dai]]", "[[Rescue Rabbit]]", and the "[[Primite]]" archetype.

  Another strategy to use are cards that inflict self-burn for their effects, such as "[[Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite]]" and "[[Performage Trick Clown]]", in order to generate advantage while recovering from the burn and Summoning a "Sunvine" Link Monster on your turn; usually [[Sunvine Thrasher]] due to his ATK skyrocketing depending on the [[Link Rating]] of the "Sunavalon" monster it is Summoned to.

  === Weaknesses ===
  One of the main weakness "Sunavalon" Decks are that the monsters usually have 0 ATK (with the exception of the 800 ATK "[[Sunvine Thrasher]]"), and they could easily be run over by high ATK beatsticks and effect negation in play.
