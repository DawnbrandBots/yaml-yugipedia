  "'''White Woods'''" is an archetype of primarily [[LIGHT]] [[Spellcaster]] monsters introduced in ''The Infinite Forbidden''.

  This archetype is part of the "[[Diabellstar]]" storyline and is related to the "[[Sinful Spoils]]" archetype.

  ==Etymology==

  ==Playing style==
  "White Woods" is a [[Synchro Summon]]ing-focused archetype that revolves around Level 2 LIGHT Spellcaster non-Tuner monsters, Level 4 LIGHT Spellcaster [[Tuner Monster]]s and Level 6/8 [[Synchro Monster]]s. Many monsters in the archetype share the common effect to send a [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card]] from the [[hand]] or [[field]] to the [[Graveyard]] as cost to activate their effects. To offset this cost, the archetype's Spell/Trap Cards, as well as "[[Whispers of the Sinful Spoils]]", feature a secondary effect to [[Set]] themselves to the field if they are sent to the Graveyard for the activation of a monster effect.
