  "'''White Forest'''" ({{Ruby|白|しろ}}き{{Ruby|森|もり}} ''Shiroki Mori'') is an archetype of primarily [[LIGHT]] [[Spellcaster]] monsters introduced in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]''.

  This archetype is part of the "[[Sinful Spoils]]" storyline.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 5 card storylines#No. 1: Witch of the White Forest}}

  == Design ==
  Lore-wise, the "White Forest" theme serves as a backstory for the two main characters of the "[[Sinful Spoils]]" storyline: "[[Diabellstar the Black Witch]]" and "[[Diabellze the Original Sinkeeper]]". It depicts their childhoods, during which they were known as "[[Astellar of the White Forest|Astellar]]" and "[[Elzette of the White Forest|Elzette]]" respectively, alongside their caretakers and sister figures, who went on to be cursed and transformed into the "Sinful Spoils" in possession of "Diabellstar".

  The artworks of the "White Forest" Spells and Traps are drawn in the style of a storybook, depicting the monsters and scenery as stylized caricatures. In the concept art for the alternate artwork of "Diabellstar", provided by ''[[The Valuable Book EX 5 card storylines|The Valuable Book EX5]]'', these caricatures are revealed to be part of a puppet theater owned by "Diabellstar" in the epilogue, which she uses to tell her story to others.

  Each "White Forest" witch is associated with a specific color, which their magic appears as. According to ''The Valuable Book EX5'', they also have a certain kind of magic they excel at.

  == Playing style ==
  "White Forest" is a [[Synchro Summon]]ing-focused archetype that revolves around Level 2 LIGHT Spellcaster non-Tuner monsters, Level 4 LIGHT Spellcaster [[Tuner Monster]]s and Level 6/8 [[Synchro Monster]]s. Many monsters in the archetype share the common effect to send a [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card]] from the [[hand]] or [[field]] to the [[Graveyard]] as cost to activate their effects. To offset this cost, the archetype's Spell/Trap Cards, as well as "[[Susurrus of the Sinful Spoils]]", feature a secondary effect to [[Set]] themselves to the field if they are sent to the Graveyard for the activation of a monster effect.
