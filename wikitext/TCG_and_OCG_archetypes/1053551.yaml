  "'''White Woods'''" ({{Ruby|白|しろ}}き{{Ruby|森|もり}} ''Shiroki Mori'') is an archetype of primarily [[LIGHT]] [[Spellcaster]] monsters introduced in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]''.

  This archetype is part of the "[[Diabellstar]]" storyline and is related to the "[[Sinful Spoils]]" archetype.

  == Design ==
  Lore-wise, "White Woods" served as a prologue for the two characters of the "[[Diabellstar]]" storyline; "[[Diabellstar the Black Witch]]" and "[[Diabellze the Original Sinkeeper]]". The theme depicts the childhood lives of "Diabellstar" and "Diabellze", both were known as "[[Asteria of the White Woods]]" and "[[Risette of the White Woods]]" during their younger days, respectively. Along with their caretakers and sister figures who went on to be cursed and transformed into "[[Sinful Spoils]]" under "Diabellstar's" possession.
  === Etymology ===

  == Playing style ==
  "White Woods" is a [[Synchro Summon]]ing-focused archetype that revolves around Level 2 LIGHT Spellcaster non-Tuner monsters, Level 4 LIGHT Spellcaster [[Tuner Monster]]s and Level 6/8 [[Synchro Monster]]s. Many monsters in the archetype share the common effect to send a [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card]] from the [[hand]] or [[field]] to the [[Graveyard]] as cost to activate their effects. To offset this cost, the archetype's Spell/Trap Cards, as well as "[[Whispers of the Sinful Spoils]]", feature a secondary effect to [[Set]] themselves to the field if they are sent to the Graveyard for the activation of a monster effect.
