  "'''Allure Queen'''" ({{Ruby|魅惑の女王|アリュール・クィーン}} ''Aryūru Kwīn'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Spellcaster]] "[[LV]]" [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They were first released in ''[[Cyberdark Impact]]'' and were used by [[Queen]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]''. They can [[equip]] opponent's monsters to themselves if Special Summoned properly.

  == Playing style ==
  The archetype focus on summoning spellcaster with 1500 ATK or less from deck and equiping monsters form your opponents field or GY as equip spells. The engine of deck uses [[Allure Palace]] which allows you to either add "Allure Queen" mosnters or summon them to your opponent's side of the field to equip to your monsters and then using ther effect gain by [[Allure Palace]] to summon any spellcaster with 1500 ATK or less form the deck and [[Allure Dance]] which its effect can be used summon multiple "Allure Queen" monsters to  link summon [[Golden Allure Queen]] That turn your effects to equip monsters and summon other spellcaster monsters in to quick effects.
  Becase of the interaction with any spellcaster monsters this strategy can be used along side cards such as [[Secret Village of the Spellcasters]] , [[Jowgen the Spiritualist]] and other themes such as "Albaz" thanks to any "Ecclesia" monster or "White Forest" since the equiped mosnters can be send as cost for its effects.

  === Weaknesses ===
  Becase of the linear way of "[[LV]]" themes the "Allure Queen" strategy is very vulnerable interruptions such as "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" especially since you will be constantly discarding cards to use the effects [[Allure Palace]] and the effect that it gives to your monsters . It's also wise to use another theme along side it becase [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] and/or [[Link Monster|Link]] Monsters lack levels wihtch prevent them from being equip by the "Allure Queen" monster effects wit the exception of [[Allure Queen LV7]].
