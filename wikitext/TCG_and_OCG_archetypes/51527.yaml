  "'''Allure Queen'''" ({{Ruby|魅惑の女王|アリュール・クィーン}} ''Aryūru Kwīn'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Spellcaster]] "[[LV]]" [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They were first released in ''[[Cyberdark Impact]]'' and were used by [[Queen]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]''. They can [[equip]] opponent's monsters to themselves if Special Summoned properly.

  ==Playing style==
  This archetype differs from normal "LV" monster archetypes in that the effects of each member cannot be activated if they are Summoned by any means other than the previous monster in the series, making "[[Level Up!]]" useless. With this in mind, they are very hard to build around and have little support besides "[[Queen's Bodyguard]]" and Spellcaster-themed support cards such as "[[Secret Village of the Spellcasters]]". However, given that a "pure" "Allure Queen" Deck would work best with three copies of all levels of "Allure Queen", "[[Solidarity]]" or "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]" are options for this type of Deck.
  The "Allure Queen" series of cards should probably be seen as an engine rather than the main focus of the deck until it recieves some new support. It synergizes well with "[[Spellbook]]" Cards and "[[Charmer]]'s" Familliars as well as any other Spellcaster support. In Deck building with the main focus of your deck being around "Allure Queen", there are very few cards that can [[Summon]] themselves to your opponents field that are a low enough level for "[[Allure Queen LV3|LV3]]" to equip to herself without effects that change their level. However being [[DARK]] [[Spellcaster]]s grants them access to a high amount of support cards that typically mention [[Dark Magician]] or [[Dark Magician Girl]] as well as the [[Pendulum Monster|Pendulum]] [[Magician]] theme.
  ===Weaknesses===
  Being a "[[LV]]" theme, and arguably the least supported by the "LV" support Cards, the "Allure Queen" strategy is vulnerable to cards such as "[[Book of Moon]]", "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" and "[[Effect Veiler]]". Their low attacks also make them susceptible to destruction via [[battle]] or effect. As the player using them, the remainder of the deck will have to be very supportive to preventing their effects from being negated while protecting them from every card in the game. "Allure Queen" Could be more of an [[Engine]] within a deck and not the card you have to worry about. "Allure Queen" will struggle against any deck summoning [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] and/or [[Link Monster|Link]] Monsters which lack levels.
