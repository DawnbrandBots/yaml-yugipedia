  "'''Allure Queen'''" ({{Ruby|魅惑の女王|アリュール・クィーン}} ''Aryūru Kwīn'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Spellcaster]] "[[LV]]" [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They were first released in ''[[Cyberdark Impact]]'' and were used by [[Queen]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]''. They can [[equip]] opponent's monsters to themselves if Special Summoned properly.

  == Playing style ==
  This archetype focuses on equipping monsters from the opponent's field to their monsters to allow them to level themselves up. Each "LV" monster has an effect to equip a monster with a Level equal to or lower than their own, with the exception of the final monster, "[[Allure Queen LV7]]", which can equip any opponent's monster to itself. If the equipped monster is still present during the player's next [[Standby Phase]], it levels up; this is especially important as each of the higher LV monsters can only use their effects if they were Summoned by the previous LV, preventing players from simply Summoning "LV7" directly with non-archetypal cards like "[[Level Up!]]" or "[[Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians]]".

  "[[Allure Palace]]" is critical to the Deck's playing style, as it can both Special Summon monsters to the opponent's field so they can be equipped to an "Allure Queen" monster, and grants them an additional effect to send themselves to the GY while equipped to Special Summon a Spellcaster monster with 1500 ATK or less from the Deck, which effectively allows them to level up immediately instead of hoping it survives until next turn. "[[Allure Dance]]" provides additional search power, gives the monsters an ATK boost based on the equipped monster's ATK, and allows the Deck to swarm the field to allow them to [[Link Summon]] their boss monster, "[[Golden Allure Queen]]", whose effect allows the other monsters' equipping effects to activate as [[Quick Effect]]s, offering much-needed disruption potential. "[[Chaotic Allure Queen]]" offers additional options for leveling up and swarming, since its ability to copy the name of the card it equips to itself by its second effect means it also can properly Summon a higher LV "Allure Queen" monster by the second part of the effect. Alternatively, it can simply Summon "LV7" without its effects to enable a quick Rank 7 [[Xyz Summon]].

  As a Spellcaster archetype, this Deck benefits from generic Spellcaster support such as "[[Secret Village of the Spellcasters]]". Also, the flexibility in which monster can be Summoned by "Allure Palace" also allows them to utilize other Spellcaster monsters, such as "[[Jowgen the Spiritualist]]", "[[Incredible Ecclesia, the Virtuous]]" (to gain access to plays using "[[Fallen of Albaz]]"), or "[[White Forest]]" monsters (who can use equipped monsters to activate their effects).

  === Weaknesses ===
  Because of the linear nature of "[[LV]]" themes, the "Allure Queen" strategy is very vulnerable to interruptions such as "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]", especially since players must discard a card to activate the effect of "[[Allure Palace]]" and must send monsters from the field to the GY to level them up. Effects that can destroy the equipped cards, such as "[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]", can also prevent them from leveling up. Furthermore, [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] and [[Link Monster|Link]] Monsters lack Levels, which prevents them from being equipped by "LV3" or "LV5".
