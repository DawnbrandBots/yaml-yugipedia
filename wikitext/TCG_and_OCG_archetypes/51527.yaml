  "'''Allure Queen'''" ({{Ruby|魅惑の女王|アリュール・クィーン}} ''Aryūru Kwīn'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Spellcaster]] "[[LV]]" [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They were first released in ''[[Cyberdark Impact]]'' and were used by [[Queen]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]''. They can [[equip]] opponent's monsters to themselves if Special Summoned properly.

  == Playing style ==
  This archetype differs from normal "LV" monster archetypes in that the effects of each member cannot be activated if they are Summoned by any means other than the previous monster in the series, making "[[Level Up!]]" unuseable. The archetype instead focus on summoning spellcaster with 1500 ATK and equiping monsters form your opponents field as equip spells. The engine of deck uses [[Allure Palace]] which allows you to summon monster to your opponent's side of the field to equip to your "Allure queen" monsyters" and then using ther effect gain by Allure palace to summon any spellcaster with 1500 ATK or less form the deck and [[Allure Dance]] which its effect can be used summon multiple "allure queen" monsters to  link summon [[Golden Allure Queen]] That turn your effects to equip moster in quick effects.
  Becase of the interaction with any spellcaster deck this deck can be used along side cards such as [[Secret Village of the Spellcasters]] , [[Secret Village of the Spellcasters]] and other themes such as "Albaz" thanks to any "Ecclesia" monster or "White Forest".

  === Weaknesses ===
  Being a "[[LV]]" theme, and arguably the least supported by the "LV" support Cards, the "Allure Queen" strategy is vulnerable to cards such as "[[Book of Moon]]", "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" and "[[Effect Veiler]]". Their low attacks also make them susceptible to destruction via [[battle]] or effect. As the player using them, the remainder of the deck will have to be very supportive to preventing their effects from being negated while protecting them from every card in the game. "Allure Queen" Could be more of an [[Engine]] within a deck and not the card you have to worry about. "Allure Queen" will struggle against any deck summoning [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] and/or [[Link Monster|Link]] Monsters which lack levels.
