  "'''Raizeol'''" (ライゼオル ''Raizeoru'') is an archetype of [[FIRE]] [[Thunder]] and [[LIGHT]] [[Pyro]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Crossover Breakers]]''/''[[Crossover Breakers]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The archetype's name seems to come from the combination of the Japanese kanji 「雷」 (''Rai'', lit. "Thunder") and "[[wikipedia:Zeolite|zeolite]]", a combustible mineral.

  === Members ===
  Each "Raizeol" monster seems to be named after various types of engines.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Raizeol" archetype focuses on a [[Rank 4]] [[Toolbox]] strategy, quickly swarming out [[Level 4]] monsters and using them as [[Xyz Material]]s to [[Xyz Summon]] Rank 4 [[Xyz Monster]]s. Each "Raizeol" monster facilitates this through quick and easy ways to [[Special Summon]] them to the field from the hand or [[Graveyard]].

  The two main Xyz Monsters of the theme are "[[Raizeol Duodrive]]", a Rank 4 monster that delivers increased stats for the number of [[material]]s it has and can detach 2 materials from the player's Xyz Monsters to add 2 "Raizeol" cards with different names from the Deck to the hand, as well as "[[Raizeol Deadnader]]", an Xyz Monster capable of detaching a material each time an opponent activates a card or effect to target and destroy 1 card on the field.
