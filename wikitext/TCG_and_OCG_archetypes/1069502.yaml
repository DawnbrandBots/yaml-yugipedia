  "'''Ryzeal'''", known as "'''Raizeol'''" (ライゼオル ''Raizeoru'') in Japan, is an archetype of [[FIRE]] [[Thunder]] and [[LIGHT]] [[Pyro]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Crossover Breakers]]''/''[[Crossover Breakers]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 5 card storylines#No. 4: Ryzeal}}

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The archetype's Japanese name seems to come from the combination of the Japanese kanji 「雷」 (''Rai'', lit. "Thunder") and "[[wikipedia:Zeolite|zeolite]]", a catalyst mineral.

  The archetype's Chinese name is a phono-semantic matching of "Raizeol".

  === Members ===
  Each "Ryzeal" monster seems to be named after various types of engines, or engine parts.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Ryzeal" archetype focuses on a [[Rank 4]] [[Toolbox]] strategy, quickly swarming out [[Level 4]] monsters and using them to Summon [[Rank 4]]s. Each "Ryzeal" monster facilitates this through quick and easy ways to [[Special Summon]] them from the hand or [[Graveyard]].

  The Main Deck monsters share the following effects:
  * You can Special Summon this card [via unique method]. If Summoned this way, you cannot Special Summon from the Extra Deck, except Rank 4 Xyz Monsters.
  * An [[advantage]] giving effect.

  The two in-archetype Xyz Monsters are "[[Ryzeal Duo Drive]]", which boosts stats and can detach 2 materials from any monster to add 2 different "Ryzeal" cards from Deck to Hand, and the central boss monster "[[Ryzeal Detonator]]", which can detach a material each time an opponent activates a card or effect to target and destroy 1 card on the field (with no once-per-turn limitations). "[[Ryzeal Cross]]" is a Field Spell that can negate the activated effect of a monster on resolution by detaching a material from a "Ryzeal" Xyz Monster (acting as another point of interaction), while also able to recycle 2 "Ryzeal" cards from the GY to draw 1. The other "Ryzeal" Spells/Traps provide situationally useful effects while being able to attach a card to a Rank 4 Xyz Monster as material; "[[Ryzeal Plugin|Plugin]]" can revive any "Ryzeal" or Rank 4 Xyz Monster from the GY or banishment then attach another "Ryzeal" card from the Deck, "[[Ryzeal Plasma Hole|Plasma Hole]]" destroys face-up cards, attaches a "Ryzeal" card from the GY, and can perform an immediate Xyz Summon and "[[Ryzeal Mass Driver|Mass Driver]]" grants "Ryzeal" monsters 1000 ATK, attaches itself to a monster as material and banishes a card from the opponent's GY.

  External support includes:
  * "[[Bonfire]]" and "[[Seventh Tachyon]]", which can search members of the archetype.
  * Xyz Monsters with GY effects (to be sent by "[[Ext Ryzeal]]'s" effect, then possibly attached to Xyz monsters), such as "[[Mereologic Aggregator]]" and "[[Eclipse Twins]]".

  Being a Rank 4 archetype, it can be hybridized with other similar archetypes, such as: "[[Onomat]]"/"[[Utopia]]" or "[[Heraldic Beast]]". Thanks to its access to easy ability to summon "[[King of the Feral Imps]]", "[[Infernal Flame Banshee]]" and "[[Gallant Granite]]" (often without using the Normal Summon), it can also be hybridized with [[Reptile]], [[Pyro]], or [[Rock]] monsters, assuming they do not conflict too heavily with the Extra Deck.

  === Strengths ===
  * High resilience against [[hand trap]]s. Even if your opponent uses "[[Mulcharmy]]" monsters or "[[Maxx "C"]]" (in the ''[[OCG]]''), the Deck can still end on "Detonator" (which acts as powerful interaction) or "[[Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir|Bagooska]]" at the cost of only 1-2 card draws. Since almost all monsters are both starters and extenders, it's hard to interrupt with one-for-one handtraps like "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]".
  * A small engine size, allowing a large amount of non-engine, and/or another engine like "[[Fiendsmith]]" or "[[Mitsurugi]]" to be played alongside.
  ** While almost every Main Deck monster locks you to only being able to Summon Rank 4 Xyz Monsters from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn when Special Summoned by their own procedure, it's still possible to get 2 monsters on field without a lock by Normal Summoning "Ice Ryzeal", enabling access to "Fiendsmith" lines. Meanwhile, "Mitsurugi" is a [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]] Deck, so it is unaffected by their Extra Deck lock.

  ==== Ritual Synergy ====
  "Ryzeal" has notable synergy with multiple Ritual archetypes, thanks in part to them not requiring usage of the Extra Deck and so not being affected by the lock, as well as the ability of "Ryzeal" to easily summon "[[Code Igniter]]" to conduct Ritual Summons.

  Some examples of synergy with Ritual archetypes include:
  *"[[Mitsurugi]]": "Ryzeal" can branch into them through the Rank 4 "King of the Feral Imps", while they can branch into "Ryzeal" through their non-Ritual Level 4 monsters, or "[[Divine Golden Shadow Dragon Dragluxion]]".
  *"[[Dogmatika]]": "[[Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous]]" can be used as a Level 4 extender thanks to her Special Summon effect, and is also searchable through one of the same "Seventh Tachyon" targets "Ryzeal" use. "Ext Ryzeal" sending an Xyz Monster to the Graveyard sets up the summoning of "[[Dogmatika Maximus]]". "[[Dogmatikamatrix]]" sending monsters from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard grants extra options to attach to "Ryzeal Detonator".
  *"[[Megalith]]": "Ryzeal" can branch into them through the Rank 4 "Gallant Granite". They can branch into "Ryzeal" through their Level 4 Ritual monsters. Several of them can be searched by adding an additional "Seventh Tachyon" target: "[[Number 106: Giant Hand]]".
  *"[[Nekroz]]": They can branch into "Ryzeal" through summoning "[[Avance, Swordsman of the Nekroz]]". They can be searched through some of the same "Seventh Tachyon" targets "Ryzeal" use.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Pure "Ryzeal" is relatively weak to non-destroying board breakers, as it relies on "Detonator" using its effect multiple times, and has no in-archetype omni-negate. However, cards like "[[Ryzeal Plug-In]]" and "[[Eclipse Twins]]" can be run to counteract this, while a side-engine can offer ways to negate.
  * Floodgates like "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" and "[[Grisaille Prison]]" can shut off the Deck.
