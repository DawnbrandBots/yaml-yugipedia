  "'''Ryzeal'''", known as "'''Raizeol'''" (ライゼオル ''Raizeoru'') in Japan, is an archetype of [[FIRE]] [[Thunder]] and [[LIGHT]] [[Pyro]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Crossover Breakers]]''/''[[Crossover Breakers]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The archetype's Japanese name seems to come from the combination of the Japanese kanji 「雷」 (''Rai'', lit. "Thunder") and "[[wikipedia:Zeolite|zeolite]]", a catalyst mineral.

  === Members ===
  Each "Ryzeal" monster seems to be named after various types of engines, or engine parts.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Ryzeal" archetype focuses on a [[Rank 4]] [[Toolbox]] strategy, quickly swarming out [[Level 4]] monsters and using them as [[Xyz Material]]s to [[Xyz Summon]] Rank 4 [[Xyz Monster]]s. Each "Ryzeal" monster facilitates this through quick and easy ways to [[Special Summon]] them from the hand or [[Graveyard]].

  The two main Xyz Monsters of the archetype are "[[Ryzeal Duo Drive]]", which boosts stats and can detach 2 materials to add 2 different "Ryzeal" cards from Deck to Hand, and "[[Ryzeal Detonator]]", which can detach a material each time an opponent activates a card or effect to target and destroy 1 card on the field.

  Major strengths of this deck include:
  * High resilience against [[hand trap]]s. Even if your opponent uses "[[Mulcharmy]]" monsters or "[[Maxx "C"]]" (in the ''[[OCG]]''), the Deck can still end on "Detonator" (which acts as powerful interaction) or "[[Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir|Bagooska]]" at the cost of only 1-2 card draws.
  * A small engine size, allowing a large amount of non-engine, and/or a side engine like "[[Fiendsmith]]", to be played.
