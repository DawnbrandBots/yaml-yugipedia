  "'''Ryzeal'''", known as "'''Raizeol'''" (ライゼオル ''Raizeoru'') in Japan, is an archetype of [[FIRE]] [[Thunder]] and [[LIGHT]] [[Pyro]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Crossover Breakers]]''/''[[Crossover Breakers]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The archetype's Japanese name seems to come from the combination of the Japanese kanji 「雷」 (''Rai'', lit. "Thunder") and "[[wikipedia:Zeolite|zeolite]]", a catalyst mineral.

  === Members ===
  Each "Ryzeal" monster seems to be named after various types of engines, or engine parts.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Ryzeal" archetype focuses on a [[Rank 4]] [[Toolbox]] strategy, quickly swarming out [[Level 4]] monsters and using them to Summon [[Rank 4]]s. Each "Ryzeal" monster facilitates this through quick and easy ways to [[Special Summon]] them from the hand or [[Graveyard]].

  The Main Deck monsters share the following effects:
  * You can Special Summon this card [via unique method]. If Summoned this way, you cannot Special Summon from the Extra Deck, except Rank 4 Xyz Monsters.
  * An [[advantage]] giving effect.

  | [[Ext Ryzeal|Ext]]
  | Send 1 Xyz monster from Extra Deck to GY.
  | If the only monsters on field are Level/Rank 4, adds 1 FIRE Thunder monster to hand.
  |-
  | [[Ice Ryzeal|Ice]]
  | Send 1 card from hand/field to GY.
  | On Normal Summon, Special Summons a "Ryzeal" from Deck.
  |-
  | [[Node Ryzeal|Node]]
  | If you have an Xyz monster in field or GY.
  | Sends 1 card from hand/field to the GY to Special Summon a negated "Ryzeal"
  |-
  | [[Palm Ryzeal|Palm]]
  | Shuffle 1 "Ryzeal" from hand/GY into the Deck.
  | In battle, sends a Level 4 monster from hand/Deck to the GY, gaining its ATK.
  |-
  | [[Star Ryzeal|Star]]
  | Detach 1 material from a monster you control.
  | Sets 1 "Ryzeal" Spell/Trap from Deck.
  |-
  | [[Sword Ryzeal|Sword]]
  | If you have a "Ryzeal" monster on field or GY.
  | Adds 1 LIGHT Pyro from Deck to hand.
  |}

  The two in-archetype Xyz monsters are "[[Ryzeal Duo Drive]]", which boosts stats and can detach 2 materials to add 2 different "Ryzeal" cards from Deck to Hand, and "[[Ryzeal Detonator]]", which can detach a material each time an opponent activates a card or effect to target and destroy 1 card on the field. "[[Ryzeal Cross]]" is a Field Spell that can negate on resolution by detaching from a "Ryzeal" Xyz monster (acting as another point of interaction), while also able to shuffle 2 "Ryzeal" cards to draw 1.

  External support includes:
  * "[[Bonfire]]" and "[[Seventh Tachyon]]", which can search members of the archetype.
  * Xyz monsters with GY effects (to be sent by "[[Ext Ryzeal]]'s" effect, then possibly attached to Xyz monsters), such as "[[Mereologic Aggregator]]" and "[[Eclipse Twins]]".

  === Strengths ===
  * High resilience against [[hand trap]]s. Even if your opponent uses "[[Mulcharmy]]" monsters or "[[Maxx "C"]]" (in the ''[[OCG]]''), the Deck can still end on "Detonator" (which acts as powerful interaction) or "[[Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir|Bagooska]]" at the cost of only 1-2 card draws. Since almost all monsters are both starters and extenders, it's hard to interrupt with one-for-one handtraps like "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]".
  * A small engine size, allowing a large amount of non-engine, and/or another engine like "[[Fiendsmith]]" or "[[Mitsurugi]]", to be played.
  ** While almost every Main Deck monster locks you to Rank 4's on Special Summon, it's still possible to get 2 monsters on field without a lock by Normal Summoning "Ice Ryzeal". This enables access to a [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] or "[[King of the Feral Imps]]" to access their respective engines.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Pure "Ryzeal" is relatively weak to non-destroying board breakers, as it relies on "Detonator" using its effect multiple times, and has no in-archetype omni-negate. However, cards like "[[Ryzeal Plug-In]]" and "[[Eclipse Twins]]" can be run to counteract this, while a side-engine can offer ways to negate.
  * Floodgates like "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" can shut off the Deck.
