  "'''Ryzeal'''", known as "'''Raizeol'''" (ライゼオル ''Raizeoru'') in Japan, is an archetype of [[FIRE]] [[Thunder]] and [[LIGHT]] [[Pyro]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Crossover Breakers]]''/''[[Crossover Breakers]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The archetype's Japanese name seems to come from the combination of the Japanese kanji 「雷」 (''Rai'', lit. "Thunder") and "[[wikipedia:Zeolite|zeolite]]", a combustible mineral.

  === Members ===
  Each "Ryzeal" monster seems to be named after various types of engines.
  .

  == Playing style ==
  The "Ryzeal" archetype focuses on a [[Rank 4]] [[Toolbox]] strategy, quickly swarming out [[Level 4]] monsters and using them as [[Xyz Material]]s to [[Xyz Summon]] Rank 4 [[Xyz Monster]]s. Each "Ryzeal" monster facilitates this through quick and easy ways to [[Special Summon]] them to the field from the hand or [[Graveyard]].

  The two main Xyz Monsters of the archetype are "[[Ryzeal Duodrive]]", which delivers increased stats for the number of [[material]]s it has and can detach 2 materials from the player's Xyz Monsters to add 2 "Ryzeal" cards with different names from the Deck to the hand, and "[[Ryzeal Deadnader]]", which can detach a material each time an opponent activates a card or effect to target and destroy 1 card on the field.
