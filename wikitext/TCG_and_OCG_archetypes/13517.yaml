  "'''Amazoness'''" (アマゾネス ''Amazonesu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that were introduced in [[Labyrinth of Nightmare]]. All members of this archetype are [[Warrior]] monsters, except for the [[Beast]] "[[Amazoness Baby Tiger]]", "[[Amazoness Pet Liger]]", "[[Amazoness Pet Liger King]]" and "[[Amazoness Tiger]]".
  [[Mai Valentine]], [[Tania]], and the Tyler sisters ([[Gloria Tyler|Gloria]] and [[Grace Tyler|Grace]]) have used "Amazoness" cards in the anime. These monsters are based on the [[wikipedia:Amazons|Amazons]] from Greek mythology.

  == Artworks ==
  The "Amazoness" cards in the English dubbed anime are re-drawn to be less revealing in appearance; this is also done for the card artworks of "Amazoness" cards in the ''TCG'', though these artwork changes would be applied much later after the initial release, unlike similar archetypes such as "[[Harpie]]s".

  == Playing style ==
  The "Amazoness" monsters are designed either to weaken the opponent's monsters or strengthen themselves, with newer members being able to [[Special Summon]] themselves. Key cards include "[[Amazoness Village]]", "[[Amazoness Tiger]]", "[[Amazoness Princess]]", and "[[Amazoness Queen]]".
  While their ATK is often weak for their Level, cards such as "Tiger" and "[[Amazoness Paladin]]" increase in strength relative to the number of other "Amazoness" Monsters on the field. "[[Amazoness Trainee]]" increases in strength for every monster she destroys. "Queen" protects all "Amazoness" monsters from [[destroyed by battle|destruction in battle]], while "[[Amazoness Sage]]" can destroy one [[Spell Card|Spell]] or [[Trap Card]] at the end of each attack; with these two cards alone, a player can defend their monsters, while slowly dismantling an opponent's backrow.
  "[[Amazoness Fighting Spirit]]" boosts "Amazoness" monsters' attacks when they attack stronger monsters; "Village" grants a slight power boost and summons from deck whenever "Amazoness" monsters are destroyed.
  "[[Amazoness Empress]]" and "[[Amazoness Pet Liger|Pet Liger]]" act as the boss monsters of the archetype, with "Empress" preventing destruction by battle or card effect and granting "Amazoness" monsters piercing damage while "Pet Liger" grants ATK reduction abilities to "Amazoness" monsters. "[[Amazoness Princess]]" acts as a searcher for the archetype, allowing quick access to the archetype's Spells and Traps upon its summon and allows for the summon of "Amazoness" monsters upon attacking. Each of them possesses a stronger variant as well; "[[Amazoness Augusta]]" possesses the highest ATK of all monsters in the archetype, can attack twice during each Battle Phase, and prevents other "Amazoness" monsters from being targeted or destroyed by an opponent's card effects. Meanwhile, "[[Amazoness Pet Liger King]]" forces enemy monsters to fight only it and provides GY retrieval by destroying another "Amazoness" card the player controls.
  "[[Amazoness Baby Tiger]]" allows for easy swarming, allowing it to be summoned from the hand or GY upon the summon of another "Amazoness" monster. Both "Princess" and "Baby Tiger" also count as "Queen" and "Tiger", respectively, while on the field or in the GY, allowing the archetype's Fusion Monsters to be summoned more easily. "[[Amazoness Call]]" acts as the deck's main searcher, allowing for the searching of any "Amazoness" card in the deck. It also allows one "Amazoness" monster to attack every opposing monsters if it is banished from the GY. "[[Amazoness Onslaught]]" allows for the removal of opponents monsters via banishing, as well as swarming via a Special Summon once per Battle Phase and another upon its destruction.
  Within [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links]], Amazoness has typically appeared as a control deck focusing around the effects of "Princess", "Onslaught" and "Baby Tiger" with "Queen" only being available in the game through leveling [[Mai Valentine (Duel Links)]] to her maximum level.

  === Weaknesses ===
  "Amazoness" struggles against backrow removal such as "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]" and "[[Harpie's Feather Duster]]", as "Onslaught" is their main form of Monster removal.
  Depending on how the deck is built, "[[There Can Be Only One]]" and "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]" can have different effectiveness as the archetype balances [[Warrior]] and [[Beast]] Monsters, leaning more to one depending on builds.
  "[[Skill Drain]]" and "[[Effect Veiler]]" can be problematic to any "Amazoness" decks, as most of their monsters have either Continuous effects or effects that can only be useful while battling.
