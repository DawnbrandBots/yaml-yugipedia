  "[[Mythical Beast]]" is an [[archetype]] of [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Structure Deck: Spellcaster's Judgment]]'', with further members and support introduced in the Booster Pack ''[[Extreme Force]]''. This archetype consists of "[[Mythical Beast Cerberus]]" and [[Pendulum Monster]]s based on it.
  "[[Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts]]" and "[[Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast]]" are not members of the archetype. However, because support for this archetype only works on [[Pendulum Monster]]s in the [[Pendulum Zone]] or [[Extra Deck]], and [[Effect Monster]]s in the [[Main Deck]], neither will be an issue.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Mythical Beast" archetype revolves around gaining [[Spell Counter]]s and removing them to activate monster effects. The "Mythical Beast" monsters have monster effects that gain Spell Counters each time a Spell Card is activated. The Level 4 and lower monsters gain 1 per Spell Card activation, while the Level 6 and higher monsters gain 2 per activation. Their individual monster effects, which require removing Spell Counters to activate, include searching ("[[Mythical Beast Jackal|Jackal]]"), recovery ("[[Mythical Beast Bashilisk|Bahilisk]]"), card negates ("[[Mythical Beast Jackal King|Jackal King]]"), and card removal ("[[Mythical Beast Master Cerberus|Master Cerberus]]" and ("[[Mythical Beast Garuda|Garuda]]").

  Though the archetype consists primarily of [[Pendulum Monster]]s, it is very ineffective at performing [[Pendulum Summon]]s; all "Mythical Beast" Pendulum Monsters have the same [[Pendulum Scale]] of 4, making it impossible to Pendulum Summon with just these cards, and complicating Pendulum Summons with other Pendulum Scales since 4 is a middling number. Their nature as Pendulum Monsters is instead meant to support their Spell Counter playstyle, as they can be activated in the [[Pendulum Zone]] as Spell Cards to generate Spell Counters for "Mythical Beasts" in the [[Monster Zone]]s. The [[Pendulum Effect]]s of "Mythical Beast" Pendulum Monsters provide more searching ("Master Ceberus", recovery ("Jackal King" and "[[Mythical Beast Medusa|Medusa]]"), and a Spell/Trap removal ("Garuda"). Their Pendulum Effects destroy the card itself as part of its effect, freeing up the Pendulum Zone for more activations. However, these Pendulum Effects can only be activated if the player controls no cards in the other [[Pendulum Zone]].

  The destruction of the "Mythical Beast" cards can also fuel up Spell Counters for "[[Mythical Institution]]" which can then search or recover a monster that can have a Spell Counter.

  The archetype synergizes well with the "[[Endymion]]" archetype, because "Endymion" Monster cards are:

  * Spellcaster-Type Pendulum Monsters that can have Spell Counters placed on them (thus allowing them to be searched or recovered by "Mythical Instituion").
  * Better Pendulum Scales for Pendulum Summoning
  * Fufill both archetypes' needs for Spell Counters which the "Mythical Beast" archetype and "[[Magical Citadel of Endymion]]" can rapidly generate.
