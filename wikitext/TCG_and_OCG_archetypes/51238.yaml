  "'''Earthbound Immortal'''", known as "'''Earthbound God'''" ({{Ruby|地|じ}}{{Ruby|縛|ばく}}{{Ruby|神|しん}} ''Jibakushin'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] used by the [[Dark Signer]]s in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, composed of 8 [[Level]] 10+ [[DARK]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with various [[Type]]s. It is a sub-[[archetype]] of the "[[Earthbound]]" archetype.

  == Design ==
  The "Earthbound Immortals" are based on the [[wikipedia:Nazca Lines|Nazca Lines]]. Each of them are pictured rising from their corresponding Line and their form matches the being they represent, as well as their Type. The "Earthbound Immortal" monsters except "[[Earthbound Immortal Red Nova|Red Nova]]" also each have a color of the rainbow that act as the faces and designs on their bodies.

  The "Earthbound Immortals" are among the largest monsters seen in the anime; dwarfing humans and being comparable to massive buildings in size. When they are Summoned in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' (and some video games), a beating stone heart appears in the sky, absorbing souls in the vicinity if this is the first time the "Earthbound Immortal" has been Summoned, followed by a flash of light revealing their full form, which emerges from the ground. If the [[Dark Signer]] is defeated, the souls their "Earthbound Immortal" took for their Summon are released.

  == History ==
  In the anime, the "Earthbound Immortals" are evil incarnations that were sealed in the [[Nazca Lines]] by the [[Crimson Dragon]] and the [[Signer]]s 5000 years before the events of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]''. They were released from their seals as a result of the [[Zero Reverse]] incident. They serve as the ace monsters of the [[Dark Signer]]s, possessing them to serve as gatekeepers of [[Old Ener-D]], which serves as the entrance to the netherworld.

  Later, the strongest "Earthbound Immortal", [[Red Nova]], from 10,000 years ago attempted to awaken after the Dark Signers' defeat by sacrificing [[Jack Atlas]]. However, Jack possesses the power of [[Blazing Soul]] and sealed Red Nova into a card, merged with "[[Red Dragon Archfiend (anime)|Red Dragon Archfiend]]", called "[[Red Nova Dragon (anime)|Red Nova Dragon]]".

  == Members ==
  8 "Earthbound Immortals" exist: 7 are used by the Dark Signers in the anime and are associated with the colors of the rainbow, while the last one is the [[Monster Card]] version of [[Red Nova]]. Each "Earthbound Immortal" is based on one of the [[wikipedia:Nazca Lines|Nazca Lines]]. Their names are based on [[wikipedia:Quechuan languages|Quechua]] words, usually for the subject depicted in the corresponding Nazca Line.

  In the anime, [[Jack Atlas]] sealed the strongest "Earthbound Immortal", [[Red Nova]], into a card via [[Blazing Soul]]. By merging the Crimson Devil with his "[[Red Dragon Archfiend (anime)|Red Dragon Archfiend]]", Jack created "[[Red Nova Dragon (anime)|Red Nova Dragon]]". Subsequently, a game-original [[Card evolutions|upgraded]] form of "[[Red Nova Dragon]]" was released: "[[Red Supernova Dragon]]".

  == Effects ==
  All "Earthbound Immortal" monsters share the following effect(s):
  ''There can only be 1 "Earthbound Immortal" [[monster]] on the [[field]]. If there is no face-up [[Field Spell Card|Field Spell]] on the field, [[destroy]] this card. Your opponent's monsters cannot [[Attack target|target]] this card for [[attack]]s. This card can attack [[Direct attack|directly]].''
  In the anime, they instead all shared the following effect(s):
  ''While this card is [[face-up]] on the [[field]], "Earthbound Immortal" [[Monster Card|monsters]] cannot be [[Summon]]ed. If there is no face-up [[Field Spell Card]] on the field, the following effects are [[negate]]d, and this card is [[destroy]]ed during the [[End Phase]]: ● This card can [[attack]] your opponent [[Direct attack|directly]]. ● This card cannot be attacked by your opponent's monsters. ● This card is [[unaffected]] by the effects of your opponent's [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s.''
  In the anime, the "Earthbound Immortals'" immunity to attacks, ability to attack directly, and immunity to Spell and Trap Cards is presented as them being incorporeal; [[Yusei Fudo]] attempted to defend his [[LP]] with "[[Stardust Dragon (anime)|Stardust Dragon]]" from "[[Earthbound Immortal Ccapac Apu (anime)|Earthbound Immortal Ccapac Apu]]", but "Stardust" flew right through the monster's outstretched hand. This is also presented as a weakness—in the anime (in contrast to the ''TCG''/''OCG''), if a player only controls an "Earthbound Immortal", their opponent can attack them directly (such as when "Stardust Dragon" passed through the body of "[[Earthbound Immortal Uru (anime)|Earthbound Immortal Uru]]" to attack directly).

  == Playing style ==
  The "Earthbound Immortal" monsters are very powerful and have effects that range from inflicting Effect Damage to your opponent while locking their Battle Phase ("[[Earthbound Immortal Chacu Challhua|Chacu Challhua]]"), to taking control of an opposing monster, as in the case of "[[Earthbound Immortal Uru|Uru]]". Also, all of them can attack their opponent directly and cannot be targeted for attacks.
  As powerful as they are, they have some drawbacks: there cannot be more than 1 "Earthbound Immortal" monster on the field at the same time, and they are all destroyed if there is no Field Spell Card active.
  If "[[Hardened Armed Dragon]]" is Tributed to Tribute Summon an "Earthbound Immortal" monster, it prevents it from being destroyed by card effects (including its own). Alternately, "[[Earthbound Linewalker]]" can be used to protect "Earthbound Immortal" monsters. "[[March of the Monarchs]]" will also stop them being destroyed by their own effects, as will the effect of "[[Number 66: Master Key Beetle]]". In an emergency situation, "[[Skill Drain]]" can also prevent them from destroying themselves.
  Their strategy basically relies on attacking directly and dealing huge damage every turn; if they are protected by cards like "[[Safe Zone]]" or "[[Mound of the Bound Creator]]", there are few ways of stopping them. "[[The Seal of Orichalcos]]" also works well in this Deck, as it can protect itself while boosting your monsters' ATK by 500. "[[Terraforming]]", and even "[[Ancient Fairy Dragon]]" if used carefully or alongside "[[Field Barrier]]"/"[[The Seal of Orichalcos]]", can assist in making sure you always have Field Spell(s). "[[Ancient Pixie Dragon]]" can also be included to increase draw power as this deck relies on Field Spells.
  The "Earthbound Immortal" monsters can all be Summoned easily, due to having no restrictions on Special Summoning them (except the field-unique condition).

  === Weaknesses ===
  Because they depend on Field Spell Cards being on the field, cards like "[[Ancient Fairy Dragon]]", "[[Black Rose Dragon]]" and even "[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]", "[[Twin Twisters]]", etc. can cause "Earthbound Immortal" monsters to destroy themselves. Cards like "[[Field Barrier]]" or "[[Malefic Stardust Dragon]]" can be used to protect a Field Spell Card from being destroyed.
  Cards that cause the Field Spell Card to leave the field without destroying it (such as "[[Shaddoll Dragon]]" and "[[Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer]]") are still a threat even with "Field Barrier". This can cause additional problems, as "Field Barrier" prevents a new Field Spell Card being played while it is active.
