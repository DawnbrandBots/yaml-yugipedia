  "'''Altergeist'''" (オルターガイスト ''Orutāgaisuto'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Emma Bessho]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]'' anime, debuting in ''[[Circuit Break]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  Each member of this archetype is based on a mythological, ghostly female creature, but with cybernetic features unlike traditional Spellcaster monsters. All of the monsters shown so far has a feminine appearance. The "Altergeist" monsters also sport a head piece that project laterally from their heads and lacks facial features except a smiling mouth.

  === Etymology ===
  The name "Altergeist" is portmanteau of the word "alter" and [[wikipedia:Poltergeist|poltergeist]]. Various members are named after both female mythological creatures/goddesses and computer terminology.

  == Playing style ==
  "Altergeist" is a [[Deck]] with a heavy emphasis on control, manipulating the pace of the [[Duel]] to its liking with the aid of numerous [[Trap]]s. Though the monsters of the archetype tend to have relatively low [[ATK]] values, they have incredibly strong [[effect]]s on the field. "[[Altergeist Multifaker]]" is one of the key cards of this Deck, being able to [[Special Summon]] itself from your [[hand]] after activating any Trap Card - not just the in-archetype ones -  and then being able to [[Summon]] another "Altergeist" monster straight from the Deck, but will also lock you into "Altergeist" monsters the whole turn you use this effect. "[[Altergeist Marionetter]]" can [[Set]] an "Altergeist" Trap directly from the Deck upon being [[Normal Summon]]ed, allowing the player immediate access to some of their strongest tools for controlling the game-state. "[[Altergeist Silquitous]]" on the other hand, can return another "Altergeist" card you control to the hand, and in return bounce back an opponent's card, allowing not only for removal but a unique form of protection for the Deck, while also provinding some recovery upon hitting the GY itself. "[[Altergeist Kunquery]]" provides a different kind of protection, Special Summoning itself from the hand when an attack is declared while another "Altergeist" card is present and negating said attack, then being able to target and negate the effects of another card the opponent controls while both are on the field. "[[Altergeist Meluseek]]" on the other hand, can slip past opposing monsters to attack directly, and upon dealing [[battle damage]], is able to target and send an opponent's card to the [[GY]], but searches another "Altergeist" monster upon going there itself. "[[Altergeist Pookuery]]" can act as [[Link Material]] from the hand and recover itself immediately after, thus using it with "Meluseek" can provide great advantage mid-Duel as the former protects the latter from being negated by most cards in the game.

  "[[Altergeist Hexstia]]" is one of the strongets monsters in the Deck, both being able to reach very high ATK values and having a [[Spell]]/Trap [[negate|negation]] effect, at cost of [[Tribute|Tributing]] another "Altergeist" monster it points to, while "[[Altergeist Primebanshee]]" can help generate some [[field]] presence by Special Summoning an "Altergeist" whenever the player wants, albeit with a similar cost to "Hexstia". "[[Altergeist Kidolga]]" can steal an opponent's monster straight form the GY whenever another "Altergeist" inflicts battle damage, and "[[Altergeist Memorygant]]" can deal a devastating final blow as it can pump itself up to very strong ATK values on-top of protecting itself at the cost of banishing a monster from the GY.

  "[[Altergeist Protocol]]", [[Altergeist Manifestation]]", and "[[Personal Spoofing]]" are also very important to the archetype; "Protocol" makes the "Altergeist" archetype much harder to deal with in general by preventing the opponent from negating the activations and effects of every in-archetype card while being a negation tool for monster effects itself, "Manifestation" can revive the Deck's monsters multiple times a turn while also retrieving the players' "Altergeist" Trap Cards, and "Spoofing" is able to search any "Altergeist" monster by shuffling an "Altergeist" card into the Deck. Similar to "Protocol", "[[Altergeist Haunted Rock]]" can negate any Trap Cards the opponent would try to activate, but requires the player to send an "Altergeist" monster from their hand to the GY both when the card is initially activated and to perform said negation, but thankfully can be activated as soon as the first turn if Set from the Deck by "Marionetter", making it the most ideal choice after "Protocol". Mixing other, generic Traps can help the Deck immensely with removal and control. "[[Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior]]" can also help the Deck by granting non-targeting removal. "[[Lord of the Heavenly Prison]]" can also provide solid protection for the Trap Cards being ran, as well as grab and Set another from the Deck if it was revealed in the hand before being Special Summoned.

  == Weaknesses ==
  * This Deck struggles against cards such as "[[Royal Decree]]" and "[[Red Reboot]]" without preparation.
  * This Deck's largest weakness is that it is slow and struggles against a well set-up board. Most of the members lack Special Summoning effects; this, along with a single [[Monster Effect]]-negating effect can give the opposing player an effective second turn. "[[Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess]]" can prevent this Deck from progressing.
  * Without "Hexstia" on the field, "[[Harpie's Feather Duster]]" and "[[Lightning Storm]]" can prevent the deck from establishing its backrow "[[Swords of Concealing Light]]" can also be used to prevent "Silquitous" from using its quick effect or to set "Kunquery".

  == Trivia ==
  * This archetype's [[Trap Card]]-centric playstyle, as well as its lack of [[Spell Card]]s, likely references the [[wikipedia:Interrupt|interruption]] computer operation system, which is also referred to as "traps".
  * While possessing design elements of [[Cyberse]]-type monsters,  Altergeist monsters are instead [[Spellcaster]]-type. This may be a play on [[wikipedia:Wizard (software)|computer software wizards]], which are user interfaces that lead users through sequences of small steps, such as configuring programs upon first-time use. This could be referenced in the Deck's playstyle of facilitating the activation of [[Trap Card]] effects.
