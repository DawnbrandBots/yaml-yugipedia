  "'''Red-Eyes'''" (レッドアイズ ''Reddoaizu'') is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[Dragon]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used most notably by [[Joey Wheeler]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and [[Atticus Rhodes]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]''.

  The archetype is based mainly on supporting "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]", whose card was created to rival the strength of "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]". The [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (Toei film)|Toei ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' movie]] stated that while "[[Blue-Eyes]]" brings power, "Red-Eyes" brings potential.

  Prior to its rename from "Red-Eyes B. Chick", "[[Black Dragon's Chick]]" was specifically excluded from the archetype because it does not have 「レッドアイズ」 in its Japanese name.

  ==Appearances==
  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga, "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon (manga)|Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]" appears for the first time in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Duel 079|chapter 79]], under the ownership of [[Dinosaur Ryuzaki (manga)|Dinosaur Ryuzaki]].

  In the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (Toei film)|first movie]], [[Shougo Aoyama]] got a "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon (Toei)|Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]" card but was too timid to use it. [[Yugi Mutou (Toei)|Yugi Mutou]] used it against [[Seto Kaiba (Toei)|Seto Kaiba]], demonstrating how "Red-Eyes" brings potential by fusing it with "[[Meteor Dragon]]" to Summon "[[Meteor Black Dragon]]".

  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]], "[[Red-Eyes B. Dragon (anime)|Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]" became one of the signature cards of [[Joey Wheeler]] after he won it from [[Rex Raptor]] in [[Duelist Kingdom]]. Joey used it and a few of its support cards throughout the series.

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'', [[Nightshroud]] and [[Atticus Rhodes]] use "Red-Eyes" Decks, including a number of "Red-Eyes" cards and their support. 

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 3D Bonds Beyond Time]]'', [[Paradox]] sent a copy of "[[Red-Eyes B. Dragon (later anime)|Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]" from his Deck to the Graveyard to Special Summon "[[Malefic Red-Eyes B. Dragon (anime)|Malefic Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]" during his Duel against [[Yami Yugi]], [[Jaden Yuki]], and [[Yusei Fudo]]. In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links]]'', it is revealed that he stole this copy from [[Joey Wheeler (Duel Links)|Joey Wheeler]] prior to the Duel.

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'', "Red-Eyes B. Dragon" appeared as a statue as one of the legendary monsters in the [[Duel Sanctuary]]. [[Roku]] played a "[[Statue]]" [[Red-Eyes Statue Dragon|version]] of it in a [[Statue Duel]] against [[Yuma Tsukumo]].

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS]]'', "Red-Eyes B. Dragon" appeared under the ownership of [[Otes]], using it in separate Duels against [[Lucidien Kallister]], [[Gavin Sogetsu]], and [[Romin Kassidy]].

  ==Design==
  Most of the cards in this archetype and its related cards that were released after the original "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" are based on cards used by [[Joey Wheeler]] and [[Yugi Muto]], the former of whom is a prominent user of "Red-Eyes". Most of them changed [[card type]]s, usually changing from [[Non-Effect Monster]]s to [[Effect Monster]]s or even from [[Trap Cards]] to Effect Monsters.

  ==History==
  The first strategy for the "Red-Eyes" archetype lies in the Structure Deck ''[[Structure Deck: Dragon's Roar]]'', which focuses on mainly on "[[LV]]" monsters and powering up "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon]]" by sending [[Dragon]] monsters to the [[Graveyard]]. 

  Prior to the release of the "[[Dragon Ruler]]" archetype, "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon]]" and "[[Red-Eyes Wyvern]]" made the "[[Hopeless Dragon]]" Deck and its more aggressive counterpart, "[[Disaster Dragon]]", possible, using multiple copies of "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon]]" to swarm the field until it was [[Limited]].

  ''[[Collectors Pack: Duelist of Destiny Version]]''/''[[Dragons of Legend 2]]'' introduced [[Ritual Monster]] support in addition to "[[Red-Eyes Spirit]]", a revival Trap.

  With the release of ''[[Clash of Rebellions]]'', new "Red-Eyes" support based on [[Gemini monster]]s and [[effect damage]] was introduced, which was expanded upon by additional support in ''[[Invasion: Vengeance]]''.

  ''[[Duelist Pack: Legend Duelist]]''/''[[Legendary Duelists]]'' introduced additional support based on [[Equip Card]]s, namely the monsters "[[Red-Eyes Baby Dragon]]", "[[Red-Eyes Slash Dragon]]" and "[[Gearfried the Red-Eyes Iron Knight]]", as well as the [[Trap Card]], "[[Red-Eyes Fang with Chain]]".

  ==Playing style==
  "Red-Eyes" is primarily a [[Beatdown Deck]] focused on Summoning monsters with high ATK, through Special Summoning effects such as "[[Return of the Red-Eyes]]", "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon]]", and "[[Red-Eyes Spirit]]". The Deck can also deal large amounts of [[effect damage]] through cards like "[[Inferno Fire Blast]]", "[[Archfiend Black Skull Dragon]]", or "[[Meteor Black Comet Dragon]]". "[[Red-Eyes Insight]]" is generally key for the Deck, as it sets up the GY while searching a "Red-Eyes" Spell/Trap, as is "[[Black Metal Dragon]]" searching any "Red-Eyes" card. Over time, the archetype has undergone many changes in card design leading to a wide variety of playstyles.

  ===Fusion Version===
  A Fusion version utilizes "[[Red-Eyes Fusion]]" to use monsters from the Deck as [[Fusion Material]] to [[Fusion Summon]] powerful monsters, then reviving those monsters using "Return of the Red-Eyes" and "Red-Eyes Spirit". "[[Red-Eyes Dark Dragoon]]" is particularly powerful, and is worth using even if it forces the inclusion of "[[Dark Magician]]" in the Deck, while "[[Meteor Black Comet Dragon]]" and "[[Red-Eyes Slash Dragon]]" are more flexible alternatives, requiring any Level 6 [[Dragon]] monster and any [[Warrior]] monster, respectively, as their second material.

  ===Ritual Version===
  A Ritual version uses "[[Lord of the Red]]" and "[[Paladin of Dark Dragon]]" as disruption and support, respectively. "Paladin of Dark Dragon" can Special Summon "Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon" from the Deck, allowing faster swarming of Dragon monsters, and its requisite [[Ritual Spell Card]], "[[Dark Dragon Ritual]]", can banish itself from the GY to search a "Red-Eyes" Spell/Trap, such as the "Lord of the Red" Ritual Spell, "[[Red-Eyes Transmigration]]".

  ===Effect damage FTK===
  "Red-Eyes" can achieve a [[First Turn Kill]] by using "Red-Eyes Fusion" and two copies of "[[Inferno Fire Blast]]". After using "Red-Eyes Fusion" to Fusion Summon "Meteor Black Comet Dragon", it will be treated as "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]", so its own burn effect combined with two "Inferno Fire Blast" will deal enough damage to win the game. The consistency of this FTK can be further improved with cards like "[[Left Arm Offering]]" and/or "[[Serial Spell]]".

  ===Techs===
  * "[[Carboneddon]]" offers an additional way to Special Summon "Red-Eyes Black Dragon" from the Deck.
  * "[[Catalyst Field]]" can help with Summoning the "Red-Eyes" Gemini monsters.
  * "[[Hieratic]]" monsters support Dragon [[Normal Monster]]s, so they can be possibly used together. They also have a few Level 6 monsters to use with "Meteor Black Comet Dragon".
  * "[[Kinka-Byo]]" can Special Summon archetypal Level 1 monsters from the GY, especially to reuse the effect of "[[Black Metal Dragon]]". Since it is a [[Beast]] monster, "Kinka-Byo" and "Black Metal Dragon" can then both be Tributed for "[[Beast-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]]".
