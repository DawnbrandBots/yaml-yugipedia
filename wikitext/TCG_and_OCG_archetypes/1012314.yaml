  "'''White Aura'''" (ホワイト・オーラ ''Howaito Ōra'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Fish]] [[Synchro Monster]]s. It is part of the [[White]] [[series]].

  Despite only having support in the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'', its members are notably used by [[Ren]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' manga.

  == Design ==
  Despite their Fish Type, "White Aura" monsters mostly depict creatures that resemble marine mammals (though in-franchise there is precedent for this, as with the unrelated "[[White Dolphin]]" and "[[Fortress Whale]]" cards). Their coloration and cetacean nature may draw inspiration from Herman Melville's famous novel, [[wikipedia:Moby-Dick|''Moby-Dick'']], which prominently features a gigantic white whale as an antagonist.

  == Playing style ==
  {{Main|White#Playing style}}
  "White Aura" monsters (as a sub-group of White Fish monsters) focus on [[Synchro Summon]]ing, with additional effects that involve Summoning from the [[Graveyard]] and becoming [[Tuners]] for further Synchro-ing.
