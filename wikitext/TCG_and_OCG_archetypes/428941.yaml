  "'''Supreme King Dragon'''", known as "'''Supreme King Servant Dragon'''" ({{Ruby|覇|は}}{{Ruby|王|おう}}{{Ruby|眷|けん}}{{Ruby|竜|りゅう}} ''Haōkenryū'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Z-ARC]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Supreme King]]" archetype.
  "Supreme King Dragon" monsters appear to be corrupted versions of the [[Four Dimensional Dragons]] (with the exception of "[[Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm|Darkwurm]]", which, anyway, resembles a smaller version of "[[Supreme King Z-ARC]]"), and are characterized by having glowing green bands with orange blotches running over their bodies just like "Supreme King Z-ARC" (only in the anime).
