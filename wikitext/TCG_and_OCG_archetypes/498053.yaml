  "'''Cyberdark'''" (サイバーダーク ''Saibādāku'') is a small [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s that support [[Cyberdark|the archetype of monsters with the same ''English'' name]], as well as a sub-archetype of the "[[Cyber]]" archetype.

  The two "Cyberdark" archetypes are different by the virtue of the monsters having an [[wikipedia:interpunct|interpunct]] between "Cyber" and "Dark" in the Japanese name (サイバー・ダーク), while the Spells/Traps do not (サイバーダーク). In the ''[[TCG]]'', it would theoretically be possible for "Cyberdark" Spells/Traps to become monsters during the [[Battle Phase]] by the effect of "[[Magical Hats]]", but the only ''TCG'' and ''[[OCG]]'' support for the "Cyberdark" monster archetype that would affect monsters on the field only work on [[Effect Monster]]s ("Magical Hats" would make them become [[Normal Monster]]s) or cannot be activated during the Battle Phase, so this is not an issue.
