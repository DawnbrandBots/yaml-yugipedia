  "'''Horus'''" (ホルス ''Horusu'') is an [[archetype]] first introduced in ''[[Soul of the Duelist]]'', and that received its first support in ''[[Age of Overlord]]''. It primarily consists of two groups: the "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon]]" sub-archetype and monsters related to it, and a set of [[Level 8 Monster Cards|Level 8 monsters]] that support "[[King's Sarcophagus]]".

  == Design ==
  === Members ===
  "Horus" monsters can be divided into two sub-series: "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8]]" and its associated cards, and monsters based on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_sons_of_Horus four sons of Horus] related to "[[King's Sarcophagus]]".

  ==== Four sons of Horus ====
  The four sons of Horus were associated with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canopic_jar canopic jars] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy mummification]. As such, their effects are related to the Graveyard.

  == Playing style ==
  The original "Horus" playstyle was focused on the "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon]]" LV monsters. The most notable card was "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6]]", which could be used as a generic Tribute Summon which could eventually Summon "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8]]", which could negate the activation of (almost) any Spell Card whenever the player desires.

  With the release of the "Horus" support in ''[[Age of Overlord]]'', "Horus" became a Deck that revolves around swarming the field with [[Level 8 Monster Cards|Level 8 Monsters]] while the [[Continuous Spell Card]] "[[King's Sarcophagus]]" is present. The four "Horus" monsters introduced in ''Age of Overlord'' (collectively referred to as the "four sons of Horus") share the following effects. 

  # "''If you control "King's Sarcophagus", you can Special Summon this card (from your GY). You can only Special Summon "(card name)" once per turn this way.''"
  # "''If another card(s) you control leaves the field by an opponent's card effect, while this card is in your Monster Zone (except during the Damage Step): ... .''"

  |}

  "[[Imsety, Glory of Horus]]" is the core starter, searching "King's Sarcophagus" and getting a draw while sending itself (and one other card) to the GY. The other three monsters do nothing in hand, but on field provide various effects in card advantage ("Duamutef"), recursion ("Hapi") or additional protection ("Qebehsenuef"). "King's Sarcophagus" passively protects "Horus" monsters from being destroyed by non-targeting destruction effects, and can send a "Horus" monster from Deck to GY, at the [[cost]] of sending 1 card from hand to GY, up to 4 times per turn - potentially preparing for all four "sons of Horus" to be Special Summoned from the GY. 

  The archetype's supporting [[Field Spell Card]], "[[Walls of the Imperial Tomb]]", can be used to search a "Horus" monster, generally "Imsety", while placing a card from hand to the bottom of the Deck. "King's Sarcophagus" while face-up on the Field Zone, allowing "Sons of Horus" to Special Summon themselves from the GY if the original "King's Sarcophagus" Continuous Spell is not present. "[[Canopic Protector]]" is a [[Continuous Trap Card]] that lets the user Special Summon a "Horus" monster from the GY in response to the opponent activating a card or effect (though they cannot Summon more than one "Horus" monster of the same name per turn), and can recur itself from the GY if it is sent there from the hand or field one time. "[[Horus the Black Flame Deity]]" has powerful non-targeted removal effects that can either send 1 card on the field, or Special Summon itself while sending all other monsters on the field to the GY (which triggers similarly to the shared effect of the "four sons of Horus").

  Due to the lack of restriction on most cards, the "King Sarcophagus"-oriented cards are frequently run as a generic engine, where the "four sons of Horus" can be used to Summon Level 8/[[Rank 8 Monster Cards|Rank 8 Monsters]] to extend or protect the Deck's main combo. "Walls of the Imperial" can send a less desirable card from hand to Deck, resetting [[garnet]]s, while the "four sons of Horus" and "King's Sarcophagus" can send cards from hand to GY. Because the "four sons of Horus" benefit from being in the Graveyard, and since "King's Sarcophagus" and "Imsety" send cards to the Graveyard as cost, the "Horus" engine is often used in Graveyard-centric Decks.

  == Weaknesses ==
  * Since the "Sons of Horus" need to be in the [[Graveyard]] to Special Summon themselves, anti-GY floodgates such as "[[Dimension Shifter]]" and "[[Necrovalley]]" can effectively shut down the deck from making any plays.
  * The "Horus" engine is relatively fragile to disruption. Interrupting "[[Imsety, Glory of Horus]]"'s search is a two-for-one exchange, while destroying "[[King's Sarcophagus]]" prevents any of the "Sons of Horus" from being Summoned.
