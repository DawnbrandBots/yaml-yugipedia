  "'''Horus'''" (ホルス ''Horusu'') is an [[archetype]] first introduced in ''[[Soul of the Duelist]]'', and that received its first support in ''[[Age of Overlord]]''. It primarily consists of two groups: the "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon]]" sub-archetype and monsters related to it, and a set of [[Level 8 Monster Cards|Level 8 monsters]] that support "[[King's Sarcophagus]]".

  == Design ==
  === Members ===
  "Horus" monsters can be divided into two sub-series: "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8]]" and its associated cards, and monsters based on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_sons_of_Horus four sons of Horus] related to "[[King's Sarcophagus]]".

  ==== Four sons of Horus ====
  The four sons of Horus were associated with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canopic_jar canopic jars] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy mummification]. As such, their effects are related to the Graveyard.

  == Playing style ==
  "Horus" is a Deck that primarily revolves around swarming the field with various [[Level 8 Monster Cards|Level 8 Monsters]] and triggering various effect when card(s) were sent to the [[Graveyard]]. The four "Sons of Horus" each has an effect that allows them to be [[Special Summon]]ed from the [[Graveyard]] if the player controls "[[King's Sarcophagus]]", and has an additional utility effect that will be triggered if a card(s) that player control leaves the field due to the opponent's card effect.

  Because of the lack of restriction on most cards, "Horus" cards can form an engine for decks that utilizes Level 8/[[Rank 8 Monster Cards|Rank 8 Monsters]] to extend the combo.

  }}

  == Weaknesses ==
  * Since each "Sons of Horus" requires itself to be in the [[Graveyard]] to Special Summon themselves, anti-GY floodgates such as "[[Dimension Shifter]]" and "[[Necrovalley]]" can effectively shut down the deck from making any plays.
