  "'''Evil★Twin'''" (イビルツイン ''Ibiru Tsuin'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] and [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] [[monster]]s which debuted in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Genesis Impactors]]''. They share members with the "[[Ki-sikil]]" and "[[Lil-la]]" archetypes, and are also supported by the "[[Live☆Twin]]" archetype.
  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX card storylines#No. 04: Live☆Twin & Evil★Twin|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#"Live☆Twin" Livestream!}}

  ==Etymology==
  Their name is likely a reference to [[wikipedia:Evil twin (wireless networks)|evil twin wireless networks]], a fraudulent Wi-Fi access point that appears to be legitimate but is set up to eavesdrop on wireless communications, usually to steal the passwords of unsuspecting users, either by monitoring their connections or by phishing, which involves setting up a fraudulent web site and luring people there.

  They also have a [[wikipedia:Palindrome#Semordnilap|play on the words]] ''evil'' and ''live'', with the "Evil★" cards showing the real characters and the "Live☆" cards showing their digital personas.

  ==Design==
  The "Evil★Twin" and "Live☆Twin" archetypes are inspired by [[wikipedia:VTuber|VTuber]] online entertainers. The "Live☆Twin" monsters are the online appearances of "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la", where they are comedic entertainers, while the "Evil★Twin" monsters are the real appearances of "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la", who are [[wikipedia:Gentleman thief|phantom thieves]]. The ''[[wikipedia:Chibi (slang)|chibi]]'' art styles of the "Live☆Twins" appear to be inspired by anime and cartoon shows such as ''[[wikipedia:Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt|Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi|Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi]]''.

  The individual names of "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la" are a reference to "Ki-sikil-lil-la-ke", a Sumerian night-demon, who was possibly the origin of the name [[wikipedia:Lilith|Lilith]].
  "[[Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny]]" depicts a rival entertainment duo to "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la", who are named as Luna and Sunny in lore.
  ===Members===
  There are three pairs of "[[Ki-sikil]]" and "[[Lil-la]]" monsters across the "Live☆Twin" and "Evil★Twin" archetypes.

  ==Playing style==
  The playstyle of "Evil★Twin" revolves around using the effects of "[[Ki-sikil]]" and "[[Lil-la]]" monsters to Summon their opposite counterparts, in order to link climb, maintain field presence, and accumulate card advantage.

  There are three pairs of "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la" monsters across the "Live☆Twin" and "Evil★Twin" archetype, each with their own pattern of effects involving Special Summoning their opposite twin:

  {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
  ! Twins
  ! Summon Opposite Twin
  ! Role
  |-
  ! Live☆Twin<br/>[[Live☆Twin Ki-sikil|Ki-sikil]] & [[Live☆Twin Lil-la|Lil-la]]
  | On Summon, if player controls no other monsters, Summon opposite twin from Hand/Deck.
  | Starters
  |-
  ! Live☆Twin Holiday<br/>[[Live☆Twin Ki-sikil Frost|Ki-sikil]] & [[Live☆Twin Lil-la Treat|Lil-la]]
  | If player controls opposite twin, Summon itself from hand.
  | Extenders
  |-
  ! Evil★Twin<br/>[[Evil★Twin Ki-sikil|Ki-sikil]] & [[Evil★Twin Lil-la|Lil-la]]
  | ([[Quick Effect]]) If player doesn't control opposite twin, Summon opposite twin from GY.<br/>Applies Extra Deck Fiend Lock.
  | Board presence
  |}

  The Link 2 "[[Evil★Twin Ki-sikil]]" and "[[Evil★Twin Lil-la|Lil-La]]" are the Deck's main board presence and advantage generators; both have a [[Trigger Effect]] that occurs when they're Special Summoned while you control the opposite "Twin": "Ki-sikil" draws a card while "Lil-la" destroys a card. Because their twin revival effects are Quick Effects, they can trigger their Trigger Effects to generate advantage in both players' turns, and setting up this grind game is the Deck's main goal.

  The Deck's Link-4 monster, "[[Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny]]", further supports the cycling of "[[Evil★Twin Ki-sikil]]" and "[[Evil★Twin Lil-la|Lil-La]]" by having a Quick Effect to Tribute itself to Special Summon both from the GY, which would trigger both of their Trigger Effects. "Trouble Sunny" can be summoned off of a 1-card combo by [[List of unofficial terms#Climbing|Link climbing]] through the "Live☆Twin" starters and the "Evil★Twin" Link-2 monsters, making the Deck very consistent.

  The deck contains the additional Main Deck Level 8 monster "[[Evil★Twins Ki-sikil & Lil-la]]", which can serve as a situational boss monster; it can be tutored with the GY effect of "Trouble Sunny", and then summoned onto the field by Tributing 2 Link Monsters, after which it can threaten the board with a conditional 4400 ATK and a partial board wipe effect.

  The Deck's Spell/Trap support provide more consistency and utility: the "Live☆Twin" Spells, plus the Spell Card "[[Secret Password]]", provide additional consistency and protection, while the "Evil★Twin" Traps provide additional disruption. Their only in-theme searcher is "Secret Password".

  Externally, the Deck synergizes with several different external engines. Because of the Extra Deck Fiend xenolocking imposed by "Evil★Twin" monsters, most of these external synergies involve Main Deck or Fiend support, or must complete their non-Fiend Extra Deck plays before going into the "Evil★Twin" Extra Deck plays. These include:
  * "[[Unchained]]", synergizing with effect of "Lil-la" to destroy a card.
  * "[[Eldlich]]", another compact Main Deck based control strategy.
  * "[[Code Talker]]" and [[Cyberse]], synergizing with the fact that the "Live☆Twin" monsters are Cyberse; they can be used to make "[[Decode Talker Heatsoul]]" before the "Evil★Twin" monsters for more card draws.
  * "[[Spright]]", synergizing with the "Twins" Level/Link 2 status.

  Since the Deck has an easy a 1-card combo, and because the Deck offers many card draws, the deck has ample space for external staples, such as [[hand trap]]s and [[trap card]]s.

  ==Weakness==
  * While "Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny" provides good interruption during the opponent's turn, mass removal cards such as "[[Raigeki]]" or "[[Lightning Storm]]" can prove troublesome for the deck, as even if player tributed "Sunny" in response to the activation, the effects of "Ki-sikil" and "Lil-la" summoned by "Sunny's" effect will not activate upon chain resolution before both were destroyed, leaving the player vulnerable to opponent's counterplay.
