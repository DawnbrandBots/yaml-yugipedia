  {{Quote|The theme's tagline in promotional material.|Startup! Transform! Mow down!}}
  "'''Sky Striker'''", known as "'''Flash Sword'''" ({{Ruby|閃|せん}}{{Ruby|刀|とう}} ''Sentō'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Machine]] and [[Warrior]] monsters of various [[Attribute]]s that debuted in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Dark Saviors]]'' (in the ''[[OCG]]'') and ''[[Dark Saviors]]'' (in the ''[[TCG]]''). It contains the "[[Sky Striker Ace]]" sub-archetype.
  "Sky Striker" is the first featured archetype of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Stories]]'' manga.
  ==Lore==

  </blockquote>
  ==Etymology==
  The Japanese name of the "Sky Striker" archetype, ''Sentō'' ({{Ruby|閃|せん}}{{Ruby|刀|とう}}), is a multilayered wordplay. The kanji ''sen'' ({{Ruby|閃|せん}} "flash") can also mean "brandish", which ties into the kanji ''tō'' ({{Ruby|刀|とう}} "sword"). Together, they form a homophone with ''sentō'' ({{Ruby|戦|せん}}{{Ruby|闘|とう}} "battle"), referencing the war theme of the archetype.

  The Japanese name of the "Sky Striker Ace" sub-archetype adds the kanji ''ki'' ({{Ruby|姫|き}} lit. "princess") to the end of ''Sentō'', forming the name ''Sentōki'' ({{Ruby|閃|せん}}{{Ruby|刀|とう}}{{Ruby|姫|き}} lit. "Flash Sword Princess"). This creates an additional homophone with ''Sentōki'' ({{Ruby|戦|せん}}{{Ruby|闘|とう}}{{Ruby|機|き}} "[[wikipedia:Fighter aircraft|fighter aircraft]]"). This likely references how the term for aircraft, ''kitai'' ({{Ruby|機|き}}{{Ruby|体|たい}} lit. "airframe"), is also used in fiction to refer to powered armor and piloted robots.

  The Japanese name of the "Sky Striker Mecha" Spell Cards, ''Sentōki'' ({{Ruby|閃|せん}}{{Ruby|刀|とう}}{{Ruby|機|き}}, lit. "Flash Sword Machine"), also forms a homophone with the Japanese name of "Sky Striker Ace". The Japanese names of the other "Sky Striker" Spell Cards use kanji that include ''ki'' (き) in their readings for similar wordplays.
  ==Design==
  As suggested by its Japanese name, the "Sky Striker" archetype is based around fighter aircraft.
  "[[Sky Striker Ace - Raye]]" is named after the [[wikipedia:Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi A6M ''Reisen'']] ({{Ruby|零|れい}}{{Ruby|戦|せん}}, "Zero Fighter"). The ''Reisen'' was considered to be one of the most capable fighter aircraft of early World War II. The ''Master Guide 6'' describes "[[Sky Striker Ace - Kagari]]" as a mode specialized for ''tokkō'' ({{Ruby|特|とっ}}{{Ruby|攻|こう}}, lit. "special attack"), which alludes to the [[wikipedia:Japanese Special Attack Units|Japanese Special Attack Units]] in the Pacific War. This references how the ''Reisen'' was later adapted for kamikaze operations toward the end of the war when newer Allied designs surpassed it.

  The rapid deployment system of the "[[Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole]]" is based on the concept of a [[wikipedia:Multirole combat aircraft|multirole combat aircraft]]. The versatile ability to access any "Sky Striker Ace" mode and "Sky Striker Mecha" equipment in response to the situation allows "Raye" to fulfill a wide range of combat roles.

  "[[Sky Striker Ace - Roze]]", who serves the enemy [[Spectra Union]], is also named after a name for the Mitsubishi A6M. Instead of ''Reisen'', her namesake is "Zero", a name commonly used by Allied forces to refer to the A6M. It may also refer to ''Zerosen'', an alternative reading of ''Reisen''. "Roze" serving an enemy nation is possibly inspired by the [[wikipedia:Akutan Zero|Akutan Zero]], an intact A6M that was seized by the United States during the war.

  In contrast to the Japanese-style names of the other "Sky Striker Ace" modes, "[[Sky Striker Ace - Zeke]]" is named after "Zeke", the official [[wikipedia:World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied reporting name]] of the Mitsubishi A6M. "[[Surgical Striker - H.A.M.P.]]" (another weapon belonging to Spectra) is named after "Hamp", the Allied reporting name of the [[wikipedia:Mitsubishi A6M Zero#A6M3 Type 0 Model 32|Mitsubishi A6M3-32]]. This implies that the naming scheme of Spectra reflects the Allied powers of World War II, while the naming scheme of [[Karma]], the homeland of "Raye", reflects the Axis powers (specifically Japan). Ironically, the "Sky Striker Mecha" devices that support "Raye" are instead named after various American aircraft.

  ===Members===
  The [[Level]] 4 [[Warrior]]s "[[Sky Striker Ace - Raye|Raye]]" and "[[Sky Striker Ace - Roze|Roze]]" are the heart of the Deck, as all other "Sky Striker Ace" monsters are [[Machine]] [[Link Monster]]s depicted as their armored combat modes (or clones, in the case of "Azalea" and "Camellia").

  The majority of "Sky Striker" cards are designated with codes visible in their artworks. The codes for the combat modes are divided between an X-series for "Raye" and a Z-series for "Roze". The majority of "Sky Striker" monsters are "Sky Striker Ace" monsters by name or archetype condition.

  The non-"Ace" "Sky Striker" monsters feature as characters in the _OCG Stories_ manga but are not typically played in the strategy, especially the Sages.

  ==Playing style==
  "Sky Striker" is a Control archetype with a game plan focused on using the archetype's Spells to generate advantage and break boards, while using the "[[Sky Striker Ace]]" Link monsters to gain access to said spells. It wins the game through out-grinding the opponent's resources. The Deck's playstyle also revolves around "[[Sky Striker Ace - Raye]]", and using "Raye" to tag between various Link 1 "Sky Striker Ace" Link monsters.

  Each of the Normal and "Mecha" Spell Cards (Quick-Play or Equip) share the following traits:
  * They can only be activated if you control no monsters in the [[Main Monster Zone]].
  * They gain an extra effect if 3 or more Spell Cards are in the GY, usually granting a +1 in card advantage. As such, a "Sky Striker" player must find a way to put 3 Spell Cards in the GY as quickly as possible to maximize their advantage.
  * They are not hard [[once per turn]].

  The other Spells in the archetype do not share the above traits:
  * "[[Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole|Mecha Modules - Multirole]]" is a Continuous Spell.
  * "[[Sky Striker Airspace - Area Zero|Airspace - Area Zero]]" is a Field Spell.
  * "[[Sky Striker Mobilize - Linkage!|Mobilize - Linkage]]" is a Quick-Play Spell whose extra effect requires the player to have both LIGHT and DARK "Sky Striker Aces" on the field and/or in the GY.
  * "[[Sky Striker Alternative - Lemnis Gate|Alternative - Lemnis Gate]]" is a Quick-Play Spell with an additional effect that can be activated from the GY.

  | That monster gains 1000 ATK
  |}

  The two key Spells to the grind strategy are "[[Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!]]", which searches and draws, and "[[Sky Striker Mecha Modules - Multirole]]", which can re-[[Set]] used "Sky Striker" Spell Cards in the GY during the [[End Phase]], providing a massive boost in card advantage.

  The "Sky Striker Ace" Link monsters can only be Special Summoned once per turn, but different monsters can easily be summoned on top of each other (many require just 1 "Sky Striker Ace" monster of a different Attribute). The key "resource" Link monsters include the following:
  * "[[Sky Striker Ace - Camellia|Camellia]]", if there are 3 or less Spells in your GY, sends a "Sky Striker" spell to the GY. Can be Link Summoned using any 2 Effect Monsters.
  * "[[Sky Striker Ace - Hayate|Hayate]]" can attack directly, and after battle, sends an archetypal spell to the GY.
  * "[[Sky Striker Ace - Kagari|Kagari]]" adds an archetypal spell from GY to hand.
  * "[[Sky Striker Ace - Shizuku|Shizuku]]", during the End Phase, can add a "Sky Striker" Spell from Deck to hand if a copy of that spell isn't in your GY.
  * "[[Sky Striker Ace = Zero|Zero]]" grants direct access to "Sky Striker" Spells and "Sky Striker" Main Deck monsters.

  To push for an [[OTK]], the Deck's in-theme method is to first clear the field, and then use the effects of "[[Sky Striker Ace - Raye|Raye]]", "Linkage", and "Zero" to repeatedly Special Summon and Link Summon during the [[Battle Phase]]. Externally, the Deck can use one of the "[[Charmer]]" (usually "[[Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy]]" as "Raye" and the Token Summoned by "Hornet Drones" are [[DARK]]), Link into "[[Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians]]" to revive a Spellcaster, then link into "[[Accesscode Talker]]". 

  Because the "Sky Striker" spells have a relatively light restriction, they can be used as an engine in other Decks. "[[Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones|Hornet Drones]]" (which can be searched by "Engage") and "[[Sky Striker Ace - Kagari|Kagari]]" can be used to make a Link-2. The cards can also be used as generic board breakers, using the power of "Engage" to search a breaker while possibly getting another draw.

  ===Weakness===
  * The limitations on the "Sky Striker" Spell Card activation conditions forces the Deck to maintain a minimalist monster presence, increasing the risk of battle damage.
  * The GY effect of "[[Sky Striker Ace - Raye]]" is the Deck's only source of post-removal monster recursion; removing "Raye" from the GY completely shuts off the Deck's ability to maintain monster presence.
  * "Sky Striker" [[Deck]]s focus heavily on [[Spell Card]]s, allowing cards like "[[Secret Village of the Spellcasters]]" and "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]" to slow down the Deck. "[[Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell]]" and "[[Spell Vanishing]]" can be particularly effective if used against "[[Sky Striker Mobilize - Engage!]]" or "[[Sky Striker Mecha - Hornet Drones]]".
  * Due to their fairly low [[ATK]], the individual "[[Sky Striker Ace]]" monsters are easily defeated if their Spell [[support]] can be countered.
  * Due to their reliance on Spell Cards to defeat stronger monsters, certain monsters with card effect immunity or targeting protection, such as "[[Super Quantal Mech King Great Magnus]]" or "[[Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax]]" can prove troublesome for a "Sky Striker" monsters to beat over by battle.
  * Anti-[[search]]ing effects can be potent, though the effects of "[[Sky Striker Ace - Kagari]]" and "[[Sky Striker Ace - Hayate|Hayate]]" can get around this.
  * Summoning Tribute-monsters such as "[[Santa Claws]]" or "[[Kaiju]]" monsters to a "Sky Striker" player's field can also be considered for two reasons. First, this prevents the "Sky Striker" Spell Cards that can disrupt the opponent during their turn from being activated since they are required to control no monsters in the Main Monster Zones (since "Santa Claws" or "Kaiju" monsters can only be Summoned to said Zones) until that Tribute monster is gone. Second, if the "Sky Striker Ace" Link Monsters are Tributed for Summoning those Tribute-monsters, it bypasses the effect of "Sky Striker Ace - Raye" that Special Summons itself from the GY, since the Link Monsters are not considered to have left the field by an opponent's card effect this way.
