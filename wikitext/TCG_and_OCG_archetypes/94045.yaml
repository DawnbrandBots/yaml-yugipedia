  "'''Darkness'''" (ダークネス ''Dākunesu'') is an [[archetype]] of cards used by [[Nightshroud]] (whose own Japanese name is also "Darkness") in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. Initially, while possessing [[Atticus Rhodes]], he used a [[Dragon]] [[Deck]] centered around Summoning "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon (anime)|Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon]]" and its [[Metalmorph (archetype)|Metal counterpart]], "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon (anime)|Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon]]".

  While Nightshroud assumed his true form, he used a "Darkness" Deck centered around [[field]] control with the [[Field Spell Card]] "[[Darkness]]", which allowed him to use a combination of "[[Infinity (card)|Infinity]]" and "[[Zero]]" to activate his "Darkness" [[Continuous Trap Card]]s. In addition, his "Darkness" monsters allowed him to Summon powerful monsters, regain his [[Life Point]]s to 4000, and check his [[Set]] [[Trap Card]]s, ignoring the prohibitive effects of "Darkness".

  So far, the only "Darkness" [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by Nightshroud that have been released in the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'' (excluding [[Boss Duel]] cards) are "[[Darkness Destroyer]]", "[[Darkness Neosphere]]",  "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon]]" and "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon]]".
