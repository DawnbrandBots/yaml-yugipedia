  "'''Phantom Beast'''" ({{ruby|幻|げん}}{{ruby|獣|じゅう}} ''Genjū'') is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[Beast-Warrior]] and [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]].
  "[[Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts]]" and "[[Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast]]" are also "Phantom Beast" cards because they have 「{{ruby|幻|げん}}{{ruby|獣|じゅう}}」 in their Japanese names. In the ''TCG'', "Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts" and "Chimera the Flying Mythical Beast" each have an [[archetype condition]] that treats it as a "Phantom Beast" monster.
  The archetype also includes a sub-archetype, the "[[Mecha Phantom Beast]]s". The [[Chimera]] series also shares many of its members with this archetype.

  == Playing style ==
  They are based around aggressive beatdown tactics, gaining advantages when sent to/while in the [[Graveyard]], or inflicting extra damage when battling.

  === Weaknesses ===
  Banishers like "[[Disappear]]", "[[Soul Release]]" and "[[Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer]]" can take "Cross Wing", "Thunder Pegasus" and/or "Chimaera"'s [[Fusion Material Monster]]s out of the Graveyard and hence nullify a motley of benefits that "Phantom Beasts" can't otherwise get much of from other support cards.  This can be contested with "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]".
  "[[Tualatin]]" is a perfect mismatch against standard "Phantom Beast" Decks as this card can keep them off the field wholly, an [[Archetype]] that is heftily needy on [[field]] presence and offensive stratagems.
