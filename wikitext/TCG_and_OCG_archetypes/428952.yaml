  "'''Phantasm Spiral'''", known as "'''Phantasm Dragon'''" ({{Ruby|幻|げん}}{{Ruby|煌|おう}}{{Ruby|龍|りゅう}} ''Gen'ōryū'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] that debuted in ''[[Maximum Crisis]]''.
  ==Design==
  The kingpin of the archetype, "[[Phantasm Spiral Dragon]]", is a [[Card evolutions|retrained version]] of "[[Spiral Serpent]]". The flavor text of the former explains that the monster has survived through countless battles, which are shown in the artworks of the archetype's [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card|Trap Card]]s, displaying several instances of "Spiral" fighting the "[[Atlantean]]" and "[[Fire King]]" [[Monster Card|monsters]]. The names of the Trap Cards, all containing "whirlpool", reflect the attack of "Spiral Serpent" described in its flavor text.
  ==Playing style==
  The archetype is heavily spearheaded by "[[Phantasm Spiral Dragon]]". Its support cards revolve around quickly [[Special Summon]]ing it and supporting [[Normal Monster]]s, with the option of trying to achieve a [[victory condition]] with "[[Phantasm Spiral Assault]]".
  A basic build of the Deck would include several Normal Monsters and support for them, as well as anti-[[Effect Monster]] cards, such as "[[Heat Wave]]" and "[[Skill Drain]]". The archetype also includes [[Equip Spell Card]]s which are key cards to the Deck, so cards such as "[[Hidden Armory]]" can help boost the Deck's speed. The [[Trap Card]]s of this archetype can be activated from the hand while "[[Umi]]" is face-up on the field, so using these cards as lynchpins in an "Umi" Deck is very effective (even though "Spiral" itself does not get the ATK boost).
