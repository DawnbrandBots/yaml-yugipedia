  "'''Phantasm Spiral'''", known as "'''Phantasm Dragon'''" ({{Ruby|幻|げん}}{{Ruby|煌|おう}}{{Ruby|龍|りゅう}} ''Gen'ōryū'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] that debuted in ''[[Maximum Crisis]]''.

  == Design ==
  The kingpin of the archetype, "[[Phantasm Spiral Dragon]]", is a [[Card evolutions|retrained version]] of "[[Spiral Serpent]]". The flavor text of "Phantasm Spiral Dragon" explains that as "Spiral Serpent", it was being hunted by the "[[Atlantean]]s", and, after finding the ancient light of "[[Pacifis, the Phantasm City]]", it gained new power to fight back. These battles are shown in the artworks of the archetype's [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card|Trap Card]]s, displaying several instances of "Spiral" fighting the "[[Atlantean]]" and "[[Fire King]]" [[Monster Card|monsters]], which according to [[The Valuable Book EX 5 card storylines]], culminates in a final "[[Phantasm Spiral Assault]]" following "[[Firestorms Over Atlantis]]". The names of the Spell/Trap Cards, all containing either "whirlpool" or "spiral", reflect the attack of "Spiral Serpent" being named in its flavor text as "Spiral Wave".

  == Playing style ==
  "Phantasm Spiral" has developed two key playstyles over time: a traditional (and arguably intended) battle-focused style involving the Equip Spells, and a slow, control-focused style involving "[[Pacifis, the Phantasm City]]". 

  Being designed against the use of Effect Monsters, any basic build of the Deck would include several Normal Monsters and support for them, such as "[[Megalosmasher X]]" and "[[Mystery Shell Dragon]]". The nature of this playstyle lends itself to anti-[[Effect Monster]] cards, such as "[[Heat Wave]]" and "[[Skill Drain]]", as they become one-sided. "[[Tenyi]]" support tends to be fruitful, giving the Deck access to a handy Counter Trap in "[[Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi]]", as well as a good starting point in finding non-Effect [[Extra Deck]] monsters. "[[Primite]]" support, particularly "[[Primite Lordly Lode|Lordly Lode]]" and "[[Primite Drillbeam|Drillbeam]]", also bolster the deck, making "Phantasm Spiral Dragon" far easier to access and serving as extra copies of "Battle" respectively.

  The archetype includes several [[Equip Spell Cards]], which are designed to give "Phantasm Spiral Dragon" additional effects. If all three are equipped, the Deck has a [[victory condition]] in "[[Phantasm Spiral Assault]]". The Spells can be re-equipped by use of the Graveyard effect of "[[Phantasm Spiral Battle]]". These features make up the battle-focused playstyle, which uses cards like "[[Hidden Armory]]" to access the Equip Spells as soon as possible. 
   
  The [[Trap Card]]s of the archetype can be activated from the hand while "[[Umi]]" (including "Pacifis") is face-up on the field. These give the Deck many points of interaction: aside from "Assault", "Battle" is targeted destruction, and "[[Phantasm Spiral Power|Power]]" is targeted negation with a useful ATK decrease. Any "Phantasm Spiral" build should use these in tandem with additional interruptions.

  However, the Deck does not necessarily have to move in a such a direction; the Deck can instead focus on maintaining "Pacifis" for the Token generation and access to "Phantasm Spiral Battle" for a control strategy. This is usually achieved using cards like "[[Sea Stealth Attack]]" and "Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi", the former of which combines unusually well thanks to the Tokens acting as easily-regenerating cost. This forms a decently-effective lockdown, as "Sea Stealth Attack" also makes the Tokens difficult to destroy in battle. Since these Decks typically play Continuous Traps, "[[Apophis the Swamp Deity]]" becomes useful, being a negate that happens to trigger "Pacifis" by Summoning itself as a Normal Monster.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Because "[[Pacifis, the Phantasm City]]" only triggers when the opponent activates an effect, much of the Deck can be easily played around by not activating any in the first place. Simply attacking without doing anything else is enough to prevent the Deck from functioning, to the point it needs to account for this by forcing effects out with outside support.
  * Being Spell/Trap-focused, removal cards like "[[Harpie's Feather Duster]]" and "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]" can remove "Pacifis" and Equip Spells, or, more embarassingly, its win condition, preventing it from making progress. This is especially effective against control strategies.
  ** If specifically facing an Equip-focused build, "[[Eternal Rest]]" is effective, but rarely worth the Deck space.
  ** If facing a floodgate-focused build, "[[Trap Stun]]", "[[Royal Decree]]", and other standard options are more than enough.
  * The Deck's ATK max out at 2900 without "[[Phantasm Spiral Wave]]", which brings it to 3400, so anything higher requires additional removal options or use of "[[Phantasm Spiral Power]]". Oftentimes, this forces out a "[[Phantasm Spiral Battle]]".
  * "[[Phantasm Spiral Battle]]" is the Deck's main removal option, which has two crucial flaws:
  ** It isn't possible to recycle without external support such as "[[Jar of Avarice]]"; lists don't often play options, giving the Deck three pops to use. Forcing these out early is essential.
  ** Because it's targeted destruction, a monster that cannot be targeted and/or destroyed by card effects is enough to stop the Deck in its tracks. This usually forces out "[[Phantasm Spiral Power]]", but this only works on targetable monsters.
