  "'''Dragon Ruler'''" ({{Ruby|征|せい}}{{Ruby|竜|りゅう}} ''Seiryū'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Dragon]] monsters. Initially comprised of a series of [[Level]] 7 monsters whose [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] always have a sum of 4600 and a series of lower-Level monsters that act as miniatures of the Level 7 monsters, the archetype received its first support in ''[[Alliance Insight]]'', adding [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] "Dragon Ruler" monsters with the big versions being [[Rank]] 7 [[Xyz Monster]]s.

  "Dragon Ruler" cards are infamously known for their historically high power level in the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'' by the times of their released, with all of its Level 7 members having been added to the Forbidden/Limited Lists for both formats from 2013 through 2015, and remaining [[Forbidden]] before slowly becoming [[Limited]] and eventually [[Unlimited]] years later.

  == Playing style ==
  "Dragon Ruler" is a primarily "[[Rank 7 Monster Cards|7-axis]]" theme, easily bringing out Level 7 monsters. The original wave of cards released in ''[[Lord of the Tachyon Galaxy]]'' enabled a potent value engine for the time: each Level 7 "Ruler" was useful in hand, GY, field, or when banished, and their ability to Special Summon from GY provided excellent recovery. They were also swarmable high ATK monsters, useful for general [[beatdown]] tactics, that could be used for a variety of strong Rank 7 monsters. The support released in ''[[Alliance Insight]]'' more concretely supports a Rank 7 strategy while taking advantage of the value/recursion engine mentioned previously.

  The Level 7 "Dragon Rulers" each have four effects, with an [[only 1 effect once per turn]] condition.

  * "You can discard this card and 1 [''Attribute''] monster to the GY; [''discard effect'']."
  * "You can banish a total of 2 [''Attribute''] and/or Dragon monsters from your hand and/or GY; Special Summon this card from your hand or GY."
  * "During your opponent's End Phase, if you control this Special Summoned card: Return it to the hand."
  * "If this card is banished: You can add 1 [''Attribute''] Dragon monster from your Deck to your hand."

  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Dragon Ruler !! Attribute !! Discard effect
  |-
  | [[Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos|Blaster]] || {{Attribute|FIRE|size=25px}} || Target 1 card on the field; destroy it.
  |-
  | [[Redox, Dragon Ruler of Boulders|Redox]] ||  {{Attribute|EARTH|size=25px}} || Target 1 monster in your GY; Special Summon it.
  |-
  | [[Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms|Tempest]] ||  {{Attribute|WIND|size=25px}} || Add 1 Dragon monster from your Deck to your hand.
  |-
  | [[Tidal, Dragon Ruler of Waterfalls|Tidal]] || {{Attribute|WATER|size=25px}} || Send 1 monster from your Deck to the GY.
  |}

  Each of the Babies requires discarding itself and 1 Dragon or 1 monster of the same attribute to activate their effects. The 4 elemental "Baby Rulers" can Summon their corresponding Level 7 "Dragon Ruler" from Deck, but it cannot attack this turn. "[[Spectral, Dragon Ruler of Flickers|Spectral]]" can add 2 "Dragon Rulers" from Deck to hand. "[[Nebulus, Dragon Ruler of Mishaps|Nebulus]]" can Special Summon two "Dragon Rulers" from banishment. Both "Spectral" and "Nebulus" also have effects to banish themselves from the GY to Summon their Rank 7 counterparts from GY.

  Meanwhile, the Rank 7 monsters offer extension, protection and recursion for used "Dragon Rulers". "[[Disaster, Dragon Ruler of All Apocalypses]]" is the in-archetype finisher, potentially banishing all monsters on the opponent's field and Graveyard, while gaining 4600 ATK and becoming unaffected when all six Level/Rank 7 "Dragon Rulers" are attached as material.

  "[[Chasma, Dragon Ruler of Auroras]]" has the ability to easily send a monster from the deck to the Graveyard and then summon it on the opponent's turn. This effect is most effective when summoning floodgate monsters, the most synergistic of which being "[[Amorphage Sloth]]" - who has the benefit of also being searchable by "Redox" and due to being Level 6 can be Tribute Summoned if the "Dragon Ruler" player has not used their Normal Summon.

  The Deck benefits from several external engines:
  * Level 7 engines, in particular the high-power "[[Kashtira]]" monsters.
  * Dragon cards/archetypes. The "[[Armed Dragon]] Thunder" monsters have useful effects when discarded by a Dragon monster for cost. "[[Tenpai Dragon]]" can be used to create a Rank 7.
  * [[Tuner]]s, to access Synchro plays. Level 3 Tuners (e.g. "[[Rose Dragon]]" monsters, or "[[Dragunity Guisarme]]" for its ability to revive "Lightning") can access the powerful Level 10 Synchro Monster pool. "[[Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying]]" in particular can benefit from the "Dragon Ruler" banishing effects.

  Thanks to the search effects of the "Dragon Ruler" monsters, different Dragon type monsters can be implemented into the deck as search targets. These will generally grant the deck a Normal Summon, something that "Dragon Ruler" do not use on their own.
  * "Blaster": The "[[Tenpai Dragon]]" starters can be accessed in order to either accomplish their full independent combo, or use as extenders for the "Dragon Ruler" strategy.
  * "Redox": "[[Primite Dragon Ether Beryl]]" can be used to access the other "[[Primite]]" cards. The best Normal Monster to use with this strategy is "[[Ryu-Ran]]", thanks to being a Level 7 FIRE Dragon monster.
  * "Tempest": Either the "Armed Dragon" or Dragon "[[Dragunity]]" monsters can be searched as extenders.
  * "Tidal": "[[Materiactor Exareptor]]" can be searched to go into Rank 3 plays - however this requires playing a Level 3 Normal monster in the deck.
  Historically these searches were utilized to access "[[Mythic Water Dragon]]" and "[[Mythic Tree Dragon]]".

  Individual "Dragon Ruler" monsters can also be played as utility tools in Attribute or Dragon-focused Decks.

  | end     = "[[Chasma, Dragon Ruler of Auroras]]", "[[Eclipse, Dragon Ruler of Catastrophes]]", "[[Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres]]" (which can summon "[[Koa'ki Meiru Drago]]") and "[[Amorphage Sloth]]" (or any other preferable monster).
  | steps   = 
  # Effect of "Spectral" to add "[[Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos]]" and "[[Burner, Dragon Ruler of Sparks]]" to hand.
  # Effect of "Burner", discarding "Blaster", to summon another "Blaster" from deck.
  # Effect of the "Dragon Ruler" in the Graveyard to banish "Blaster" and another monster to summon itself.
  # Effect of "Blaster" to search for "[[Tenpai Dragon Genroku]]".
  # Effect of "Genroku" to summon itself, then tribute itself to summon "[[Tenpai Dragon Paidra]]".
  # Effect of "Paidra" to add "[[Sangen Kaimen]]".
  # "Kaimen" add "[[Tenpai Dragon Chundra]]" and summon.
  # Summon "[[Chasma, Dragon Ruler of Auroras]]" using "Blaster" and the other "Dragon Ruler".
  # Effect of "Chasma" to copy "[[Tidal, Dragon Ruler of Waterfalls]]" to send "[[Amorphage Sloth]]" or any other preferred monster.
  # Summon "[[Sangenpai Bident Dragion]]" using "Chundra" and "Paidra".
  # "Bident Dragion" summons a "Tenpai Dragon" from Graveyard.
  # Summon a "Dragon Ruler" by banishing two "Tenpai Dragon" monsters.
  # Summon "[[Eclipse, Dragon Ruler of Catastrophes]]" using "Bident Dragion" and a "Dragon Ruler".
  # Effect of "Eclipse" to summon a banished "Dragon Ruler".
  # Link Summon "[[Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres]]" using the "Tenpai Dragon" and "Dragon Ruler" monsters that were summoned from Graveyard and banishment.
  # At the start of the opponent's turn: Use effect of "Chasma" to copy "[[Redox, Dragon Ruler of Boulders]]" and summon "Sloth" from Graveyard.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The Deck is vulnerable to several lingering handtraps, including "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" (the archetype has many searchers), "[[Artifact Lancea]]" / "[[Chaos Hunter]]" (the Level 7s banish to summon themselves), and "[[Dimension Shifter]]" (due to relying on the GY). While not a game-ender when first released, the loss of tempo hurts in the modern game.
  * Floodgates:
  ** Anti-GY floodgates, like "[[Macro Cosmos]]" and "[[Necrovalley]]".
  ** Anti-Special Summon floodgates, like "[[Evilswarm Ophion]]", "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Crimson Blader]]", "[[Summon Limit]]", and "[[Jowgen the Spiritualist]]" (''OCG/Traditional Format''). Historically, "Crimson Blader" was particularly strong in the mirror.
  ** Anti-banish floodgates, like "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" and "[[Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer]]".
