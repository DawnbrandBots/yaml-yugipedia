  "'''Thunder Dragon'''" (サンダー・ドラゴン ''Sandā Doragon'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] [[Thunder]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. The archetype originates from the monster "[[Thunder Dragon]]", which was introduced in the ''[[Vol.7]]'' [[Booster Pack]] in 2000 and only had one related monster: "[[Twin-Headed Thunder Dragon]]". The "series" was massively expanded in 2018's ''[[Soul Fusion]]'', giving "Thunder Dragon" a set of [[Main Deck]] and [[Extra Deck]] monsters and supporting [[Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s.

  ==Design==
  The general design and effect of each "Thunder Dragon" monster is derived from the original "Thunder Dragon": all of them are depicted as electric dragons with a color scheme incorporating green, yellow, black and/or gray. "[[Thunder Dragon Titan]]" resembles a three-headed "Thunder Dragon", similar to the design of "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]". "[[Thunder Dragondark]]" is a directly [[retrained]] [[counterpart]] of the original "Thunder Dragon", with the same [[Type]], [[Level]], [[original ATK and DEF]], but the opposite Attribute; it also has a similar effect that can search a copy of itself.

  ==Playing style==
  "Thunder Dragon" revolves around Thunder monsters with [[discard]], [[floater|floating]], and [[banish]]-activated effects, in order to set up resource recursion and summon conditions for boss monsters.

  The archetype has 5 (relatively low-Level) Main Deck monsters with Levels under 6, who serve as combo pieces to bring out the archetype's boss monsters. Almost all of them have two effects: an [[Ignition Effect]] activated by [[discard]]ing them, and a [[Trigger Effect]] that can be activated when they are [[banish]]ed or sent from the field to the Graveyard. These effects provide search power and field setup, and also sets up the GY with monsters for the archetype's other effects.

  |-
  | colspan = 4 | <small>Except "[[Thunder Dragon]]", all the above effects are [[only 1 effect once per turn]].</small>
  |}
  Of these monsters, "Thunder Dragonmatrix" is the only one under Level 4, making it the only one that can be Normal Summoned without Tributes.

  "Thunder Dragon" boss monsters consist of both Main Deck [[Special Summon-only monster]]s ("[[Thunder Dragonduo|Dragonduo]]" and "[[Thunder Dragonlord|Dragonlord]]") and Extra Deck [[Fusion Monster]]s ("[[Thunder Dragon Colossus|Colossus]]" and "[[Thunder Dragon Titan|Titan]]"). The former are summoned from the hand by banishing friendly cards in the hand/GY, while the latter are summoned with [[Fusion Summon]]ing or pseudo-[[Contact Fusion]].

  | [[Thunder Dragon Titan|Titan]] || {{Attribute|LIGHT|size=24}} || 3 "Thunder Dragon" monsters || Banish 1 Thunder monster from your hand and 1 Thunder Fusion Monster you control, except "Thunder Dragon Titan".
  |}
  On the field, the Main Deck bosses provide protection ("[[Thunder Dragonlord]]") or card resource cycling ("[[Thunder Dragonduo]]"), while the Fusion bosses provide removal/interruption ("[[Thunder Dragon Titan]]") or floodgating ("[[Thunder Dragon Colossus]]"). Each has one effect that banishes cards from the player's GY, possibly even in the opponent's turn, providing more triggers for "Thunder Dragon" banish effects.

  "[[Thunder Dragon Fusion]]", the archetype's Fusion Spell, works with the archetype's discard and banish effects by Fusion Summoning through shuffling materials from the field, GY, or banished cards into the Deck. It can also banish itself from the GY (except on the turn it was sent there) to search out 1 Thunder monster, providing additional follow-up.

  Because almost all "Thunder Dragon" non-boss monsters require setup/external combos to be summoned, their Trigger Effects are more easily triggered by banishing them. This can be achieved with:
  * Banish from Deck: "[[Gold Sarcophagus]]", "[[Aloof Lupine]]"
  * Banish from hand: "[[Allure of Darkness]]",  Summon procedure of "[[Thunder Dragonlord]]", alternate Summon procedure of "[[Thunder Dragon Titan]]"
  ** The alternate summon procedure of "Titan" can be established by using "[[Instant Fusion]]" or "[[Ready Fusion]]" to summon "[[Kaminari Attack]]"
  * Banish from GY: Summon procedure of "[[Thunder Dragonduo]]", [[Chaos (series)|Chaos]] series monsters, "[[Bystial]]" monsters

  Generally, the Deck aims to turbo out one or more of its boss monsters, primarily (in formats where it's available) the high-power and easy-to-summon "[[Thunder Dragon Colossus]]", and back them up with other generic field presence and searchable follow-up. The Deck's main searchers are the banish/floating effects of "[[Thunder Dragondark]]" and "[[Thunder Dragonroar]]", while its main source of swarming are the effects of "Dragonroar" and "[[Thunder Dragonhawk]]".

  ===Weaknesses===
  * As the deck is reliant on banishing, it is weak to anti-banishing floodgates. (e.g. "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]", "[[Artifact Lancea]]", "[[Soul Drain]]")
  * As the deck is reliant on Summoning, it is weak to anti-summoning floodgates. (e.g. "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]")
