  "'''Red Dragon Archfiend'''", known as "'''Red Daemon'''" (レッド・デーモン ''Reddo Dēmon'') in Japan and "'''Red Dragon'''" in the manga, is an [[archetype]] used by [[Jack Atlas]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (manga)|manga]], [[Fake Jack Atlas]], and an alternate dimension [[Jack Atlas (ARC-V)|Jack Atlas]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime.

  The archetype is a sub-archetype of the "[[Archfiend]]" archetype, and primarily consists of Jack Atlas' [[Signer Dragon]], "[[Red Dragon Archfiend]]", and [[Duel Dragon]], "[[Hot Red Dragon Archfiend]]", and their upgraded forms in the anime and manga, respectively.

  This archetype is the rival to the "[[Stardust (archetype)|Stardust]]" archetype, used by Jack Atlas' rival, [[Yusei Fudo]].

  ==Design==
  [[File:Tyrant_Dragon_and_Scarlight_Dragon.png|thumb|left|180px|"[[Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend]]" alongside its evolution, "[[Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend]]"]]
  In general, every member of this archetype appear as armored demonic dragons with curling horns and spikes all along the body, although the root of their design comes from the painting ''[[wikipedia:The Great Red Dragon Paintings|The Great Red Dragon]]'' by [[wikipedia:William Blake|William Blake]]. ().

  ==Playing style==
  In contrast to the Defensive, [[Negate|negation]]-focused "[[Stardust Dragon]]", "Red Dragon Archfiend" and its related cards revolves around Offensive battle and destruction effects, usually manifesting as a board wipe effect. Higher-Level "RDA"-related monsters also notably feature the use of [[Double Tuning|Double]] or [[Triple Tuning]].

  As a Deck, the "Red Dragon Archfiend" strategy generally involves using Jack Atlas-themed support cards, primarily the "[[Resonator]]" monsters, but also various Jack-themed low-Level Fiends (including the "[[Red (series)|Red]]" monsters), to summon "RDA" and its related Synchro bosses; these themed support encompass both direct support (supporting "[[Red Dragon Archfiend]]" or "Red Dragon Archfiend"/"Resonator" archetypal monsters) and indirect support (supporting high-Level DARK Dragon Synchro Monsters or low-Level Fiends).

  The deck generally aims to swarm "Resonator" Tuner monsters and low-Level Fiends, in order to build a board consisting of RDA-related boss monsters, general DARK Dragon Synchro boss monsters, and searchable "RDA"-specific backrow. Importantly, the deck's Extra Deck choices are limited because several of its key cards [[xenolock|lock]] the player's Extra Deck into DARK Dragon Synchro Monsters only. 

  The deck's main combo makers are the "Resonator" monster "[[Crimson Resonator]]", and the Level 6 Synchro Monster "[[Red Rising Dragon]]", both of whom applies the xenolock.
  * "Crimson Resonator" can Summon two "Resonators" from the Deck if the player controls only controls it and a DARK Dragon Syncho; it can tutor out key "Resonator" monsters and provide the necessary levels for future combos.
  * "Red Rising Dragon" can non-hard once per turn revive "Resonator" monsters in the GY if it is Synchro Summoned; provided the player has the extenders, it can be repeatedly summoned for [[List of unofficial terms#Climbing|Synchro climbing]].

  Other key combo makers include:
  * Searchers: 
  ** "[[Resonator Call]]": "Resonator" searcher
  ** "[[Resonator Command]]", "[[Soul Resonator]]": Low-level Fiend searcher
  ** "[[Bone Archfiend]]": Send-from-Deck Fiend searcher
  ** "[[Crimson Gaia]]", "[[Vision Resonator]]": "RDA"-support searcher
  * Extenders:
  ** "[[Wandering King Wildwind]]", "[[Bone Archfiend]]": Non-Tuner low-Level Fiend extenders
  ** "[[Vision Resonator]]", "[[Synkron Resonator]]": "Resonator" Tuner extenders
  ** "[[Scarred Dragon Archfiend]]": Extra Deck extender, grants +8 extra Levels for Synchro climbing

  The deck almost always aims to resolve the summon-from deck effect of "Crimson Resonator" to make its larger plays. One 1.5-card combo that can perform this involves having only "[[Soul Resonator]]" and another card in hand:
  # Summon "Soul Resonator", search "[[Bone Archfiend]]"
  # [[Special Summon]] "Bone Archfiend" (sending another card to the [[GY]])
  # "Bone Archfiend" mills "Crimson Resonator", decrease its own Level by 1
  # "Bone Archfiend" and "Soul Resonator" summons "[[Red Rising Dragon]]", who revives "Crimson Resonator", setting up its effect

  Once "Crimson Resonator" successfully resolves, the Deck can be pivoted into a variety of RDA-related or general DARK Dragon Synchro boss monsters (e.g. "[[Hot Red Dragon Archfiend Abyss]]", "[[Bystial Dis Pater]]", "[[Red Supernova Dragon]]"), as well as searchable RDA-related backrow (e.g. "[[Red Zone]]").

  Externally, a variety of cards provide additional support to various aspects of the deck's core combos:
  * "[[Earthbound Prisoner Stone Sweeper]]" is an additional "Resonator" searcher.
  * "[[Obsessive Uvualoop]]" is a Level 4 Fiend Tuner extender who can [[banish]] Synchro Monsters from the GY; the banished monsters can be re-summoned with "Bystial Dis Pater" or "Red Zone".
  * "[[Bystial]]" monsters provide Level 6 extenders, additional interruptions, and beatsticks. "[[The Bystial Lubellion]]" can also search "[[Etude of the Branded]]", which enables Synchro Summoning during the opponent's turn; this can create a potent floodgate by summoning "[[Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity]]" on the opponent's turn.
  * From the [[Inca]] series, "[[Supay, Duskwalker]]" and "[[Ascator, Dawnwalker]]" are both 1.5 card extenders who can set up Level 6 or Level 8 Synchros; the former can summon "Red Rising Dragon", the latter can summon a Level 8 "Red Dragon Archfiend" monster.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Because of the restrictions applied with "Crimson Resonator" and "Red Rising Dragon", the Deck has a very limited toolbox option, and its combos are very inflexible.

  * "Crimson Resonator" and "Red Rising Dragon" are the Deck's main chokepoints; negating them typically means that the Deck will no longer be able to combo.

  * The Deck can be directly countered by:
  ** Anti-Synchro cards (e.g. "[[Meklord]]")
  ** Anti-Dragon cards (e.g. "[[Buster Blader (archetype)|Buster Blader]]")

  * The user's constant board of having at least 2 DARK monsters (including Dragons) throughout the deck's combos and at the end makes the Deck very susceptible to having their monsters cleared away as [[Fusion Material]]s by an opponent's "[[Super Polymerization]]" for their [[Fusion Monsters]]" such as "[[Starving Venom Fusion Dragon]]", "[[Predaplant Triphyoverutum]]", "[[Garura, Wings of Resonant Life]]", "[[Borreload Furious Dragon]]" etc.
  ** "[[Branded]]-[[Despia]]" can additionally use "[[Branded Banishment]]" to banish the user's monsters as Fusion Materials for Summoning some of the aforementioned Fusion Monsters, and "[[Fallen of Albaz]]" to remove all of the user's Dragon monsters they control for "[[Alba-Lenatus the Abyss Dragon]]".
