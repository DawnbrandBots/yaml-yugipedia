  "'''Star Seraph'''", known as "'''Holy Lightning'''" ({{Ruby|光天使|ホーリー・ライトニング}} ''Hōrī Raitoningu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fairy]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Dumon]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime. Their non-[[Xyz Monster]]s' [[effect]]s are centered around quickly Summoning each other from the hand, for [[Xyz Summon]]ing their own [[Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry|ace]] and other [[Rank]] 4 [[Xyz Monster]]s. The members introduced in ''[[Duelist Alliance]]'' focus on drawing cards, as well as swarming for Xyz Monsters that need 3 or more materials.
  ==Etymology==
  The kanji in their Japanese names literally translate to "Light Angel", fitting to both their [[Type]] and [[Attribute]].
  Each member's English name is also an alliteration of the letter S.
  ==Playing style==

  Similar, to the "[[hunder]]" archetype, "Star Seraph" monsters focus on swarming the [[field]]. All "Star Seraph" monsters are [[Level]] 4 with slightly different effects as "hunders". With "[[Star Seraph Scout]]", when Normal Summoned, you can Special Summon another "Star Seraph" monster from your hand. The effect of "[[Star Seraph Sage]]" has you [[discard]] a [[Spell Card|Spell]] from your [[hand]] to Special Summon another "Star Seraph" monster from your hand. While the last monster, "[[Star Seraph Sword]]", instead of being able to Special Summon, it [[send]]s a "Star Seraph" monster from your hand to the [[Graveyard]] to increase its [[ATK]] until the [[End Phase]]. Adding in "[[Nova Summoner]]" is a great idea since when it's [[destroy]]ed, you can Special Summon a LIGHT Fairy monster with 1500 ATK or less. It proves to be a much better option than "[[Shining Angel]]", whose effect leaves your [[Life Points]] open due to Special Summoning your monster in [[Attack Position]].
  The new members introduced in ''Duelist Alliance'' have a greater focus on boosting Xyz Monsters that require 3 monsters that use them as Xyz Material, while also focusing on replenishing the hand. For example "[[Star Seraph Scepter]]" can [[search]] a "Star Seraph" monster when it is either Normal or Special Summoned, while if it is used as a Xyz Material for a Xyz Monster of 3 Materials, Scepters allows that monster to destroy a card as soon as that monster is summoned, and if successful the user can draw a card. Worth of note is that "Scepter's" effects can be used as many times in a turn as possible, so one can use cards like "[[Call of the Haunted]]" or "[[Pinpoint Guard]]" to great effect. Furthermore the effects of "Scepter" are cumulative, that is to say one can use 3 copies of "Scepter" on a single Xyz Summon, and destroy just as many cards the opponent controls. This effect is Specially useful with the likes of "[[Stellarknight Delteros]]" whose effect prevents the opponent from activating any card when successfully summoned, thus preventing the opponent from losing cards.
  "[[Star Seraph Sovereignty]]" can be instantly summoned by its own effect when another "Star Seraph" monster is summoned, and providing an immediate draw and if it was a "Star Seraph" monster, can instantly Special Summon it. While "Sovereign" cannot be used as a Xyz Material unless the Xyz Monster requires 3 monsters, this can be mitigated by using cards such as "[[Photon Thrasher]]", "[[Goblindbergh]]", "[[Heroic Challenger - Assault Halberd]]" and other similar monsters, coupled with its high DEF value make him a reliable asset. Finally "[[Star Seraph Scale]]" can place on the top of the Deck from the Graveyard ''any'' LIGHT monster if its effect resolves successfully, which can be taken to great advantage by redrawing it the next turn, making it possible to reuse powerful cards such as "Seraph", "Honest" or any that can be needed. Furthermore if used as a material for a Xyz Monster that requires 3 monsters, it can provide a draw to the user if any player Special Summons from the hand, which is a recurrent phenomenon.
  Also since they are Fairy monsters, cards like "[[Valhalla, Hall of the Fallen]]" and "[[Archlord Kristya]]" can be used reliable to greatly enhance the summon of strong boss monsters.
