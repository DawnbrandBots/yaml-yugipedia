  "'''Ghoti'''", spelled "'''Ghotis'''" (ゴーティス ''Gōtisu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Fish]] monsters which first debuted in ''[[Power of the Elements]]''.

  == Lore ==
  According to the description of the "[[Ghoti of the Deep Beyond]]" Protector in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel]]'', "Ghoti" dwell in an alternate dimension that spans eternity. It is simultaneously the furthest end and the beginning.

  == Etymology ==
  [[wikipedia:Ghoti|Ghoti]] is a proposed alternative spelling of the English word "fish" used in an 1855 letter between two authors, used to highlight the disparity between written and spoken English. It is derived from the "gh" in "tough" (pronounced as an "f" sound), the "o" in "women" (pronounced as an "i" sound), and the "ti" in "nation" (pronounced as a "sh" sound).

  Most "Ghoti" monsters have names that are anagrams of words related to fish in various languages.

  The archetype's Chinese name, "游魊" (Pinyin: yóu yù), literally means "swimming ''yù'' monster". 魊 also refers to a legendary demon hidden in water to harm people. Additionally, 魊 is a partial homophone of the Chinese word for fish, 鱼 (Pinyin: yú). Thus, 游魊 collectively evokes the thematic meaning of "swimming, monstrous fish".

  == Design ==
  The "Ghoti" archetype is comprised of even Leveled [[WATER]] [[Fish]] monsters, with most of the Level 2 monsters being [[Tuner monster]]s. The archetype's non-Tuner monsters all have 0 DEF, and starting with the Level 4 monster having 1500 ATK, each non-Tuner monster from Levels 4 to 8 has 600 more ATK than the monsters that are 2 Levels below them.
  Aesthetically, the archetype's monsters seem to be large extraterrestrial lifeforms resembling various types of sea creatures. They appear to swim through outer space akin to the deep ocean.

  == Playing style ==
  "Ghoti" focuses on [[banish]]ing its [[Main Deck]] monsters, which [[Special Summon]] themselves from banishment immediately or during the next [[Standby Phase]], then using their effects to [[Synchro Summon]] during the opponent's [[Main Phase]]. Many of the theme [[Synchro Monster]]s have disruptive effects when properly Summoned, leading to a sneak attack playstyle.

  * "[[Paces, Light of the Ghoti]]" and "[[Shif, Fairy of the Ghoti]]" are the usual targets to get access to as soon as possible. "Paces" can banish itself from [[field]] to Special Summon a [[Fish]] from the [[hand]], while "Shif" can banish itself from the [[Graveyard]] if you control a Fish. After being banished, however, they have to wait until the next Standby Phase to Summon themselves.
  * "[[Zep, Ruby of the Ghoti]]" can instead Special Summons itself right after after being banished and Synchro Summons immediately. This makes it the prime target to banish with "[[Arionpos, Serpent of the Ghoti]]" during the opponent's turn.

  This archetype synergizes very well with the "[[White]]" series, as they are both based around Summoning [[WATER]] Synchro Monsters and made of monsters with matching [[Level]]s.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Anti-banish cards like "[[Artifact Lancea]]" and are very difficult to deal with.
  ** Cards that profit from the opponent's banishing like "[[Mulcharmy Meowls]]" also put them in an awkward situation.
  * Anti-Synchro cards like "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" cut off most of the archetype.
  ** This can however be mitigated by the Link plays it has access to, if it is not locked.
  * The archetype heavily relies on setting up turn 1, then Synchro Summoning on the opponent's turn, thus it has a hard time when forced to go second.
