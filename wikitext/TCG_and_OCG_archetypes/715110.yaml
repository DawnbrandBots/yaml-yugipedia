  "'''Ghoti'''", spelled "'''Ghotis'''" (ゴーティス ''Gōtisu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Fish]] monsters which first debuted in ''[[Power of the Elements]]''.

  == Etymology ==
  [[wikipedia:Ghoti|Ghoti]] is a proposed alternative spelling of the English word "fish" used in an 1855 letter between two authors, used to highlight the disparity between written and spoken English. It is derived from the "gh" in "tough" (pronounced as an "f" sound), the "o" in "women" (pronounced as an "i" sound), and the "ti" in "nation" (pronounced as a "sh" sound).

  Most "Ghoti" monsters have names that are anagrams of words related to fish in various languages.

  The archetype's Chinese name, "游魊" (Pinyin: yóu yù), literally means "swimming ''yù'' monster". 魊 also refers to a legendary demon hidden in water to harm people. Additionally, 魊 is a partial homophone of the Chinese word for fish, 鱼 (Pinyin: yú). Thus, 游魊 collectively evokes the thematic meaning of "swimming, monstrous fish".

  == Design ==
  The "Ghoti" archetype is comprised of even Leveled [[WATER]] [[Fish]] monsters, with most of the Level 2 monsters being [[Tuner monster]]s. The archetype's non-Tuner monsters all have 0 DEF, and starting with the Level 4 monster having 1500 ATK, each non-Tuner monster from Levels 4 to 8 has 600 more ATK than the monsters that are 2 Levels below them.
  Aesthetically, the archetype's monsters seem to be large extraterrestrial lifeforms resembling various types of sea creatures. They appear to swim through outer space akin to the deep ocean.

  == Playing style ==
  "Ghoti" focuses on banishing its Main Deck monsters, which Summon themselves from banishment immediately/during the next Standby Phase, then using their effects to [[Synchro Summon]] during the opponent's Main Phase. Many of the Synchro Monsters have disruptive effects when Summoned, leading to a varied playstyle.

  * "[[Paces, Light of the Ghoti|Paces]]" and "[[Shif, Fairy of the Ghoti|Shif]]" are the typical search targets. "Paces" can banish itself from field to Summon a Fish from hand, while "Shif" can banish itself from the GY if a Fish is on field. After being banished, they summon themselves on the next Standby Phase.
  * "[[Zep, Ruby of the Ghoti|Zep]]" instead Special Summons itself immediately after being banished, and Synchros immediately on Summon. This makes it the prime target to banish with "[[Arionpos, Serpent of the Ghoti]]".

  It synergizes well with the "[[White]]" series, as they are both based around Fish Synchros and have similar levels.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The archetype relies heavily on setting up turn 1, then Synchro Summoning on the opponent's turn. It thus has a hard time when forced to go second.
  * Floodgates:
  ** Anti-banish cards like "[[Artifact Lancea]]" and "[[Mulcharmy Meowls]]" are difficult to deal with.
  ** Anti-Synchro cards like "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" also cut off most of the archetype.
