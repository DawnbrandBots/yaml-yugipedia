  ==Members==
  Each "GMX" [[Fusion Monster]] is an anthropomorphic dinosaur named after a real-world species of dinosaur.

  ==Playing style==
  The theme is composed of three varieties of monsters; non-[[Dinosaur]] "GMX" monsters, non-"GMX" Dinosaur monsters, and Dinosaur "GMX" [[Fusion Monster]]s. The [[Main Deck]] monsters all have effects that [[activate]] when [[Special Summon]]ed by a monster effect, either to add a "GMX" card to the [[hand]] or to place cards on top of the Deck, setting up the theme's Fusion Spell, "[[GMX Applied Experiment 55|GMX Applied Experiment #55]]", which [[excavate]]s cards from the top of the Deck to [[Fusion Summon]] until both a "GMX" monster and a Dinosaur monster have been excavated, but reduces the player's [[LP]] by 400 for each card excavated. The "GMX" Fusion Monsters help alleviate the LP cost with their [[Continuous Effect]]s to gain 200 LP each time the opponent [[Normal Summon|Normal]] or [[Special Summon]]s a monster.
