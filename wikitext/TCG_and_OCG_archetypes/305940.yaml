  "'''Shaddoll'''" (シャドール ''Shadōru'') is an [[archetype]] comprised primarily of [[DARK]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Duelist Alliance]]''. The archetype is primarily focused on [[Fusion Summon]]ing, with powerful "[[El Shaddoll]]" boss monsters that punish [[Special Summon]]ing, versatile [[Spell]]s and [[Trap]]s for Fusion Summoning, and [[Main Deck]] monsters that can provide advantage when sent to the [[GY]] as [[Fusion Material]]s.

  {{Main|Master Guide 5 card storylines#Awakening of the Shaddolls}}
  In the abyss of [[Master Guide 3 card storylines|this world]], there is a certain something called the "[[Shaddoll Core]]" (The Primordial "Core" of Shadow-Possession) which gives birth to shadows that absorb light, the "Shaddoll". "[[El Shaddoll Construct]]" uses these shadow strings to control the manifested shadows, and with this to extend its influence and power...<ref>[http://www.ygorganization.com/lore-shadoll-and-ryuusei/ YGOrganization] - [Lore] Shadoll and Ryuusei</ref>
  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  The "Shaddoll" cards appear to be darker puppet versions of cards from other archetypes in the ''[[Duel Terminal]]'' world, with their threads coming from the back of "[[El Shaddoll Construct]]".
  ===Etymology===
  "Shaddoll" is a portmanteau of the words ''"shadow"'' and ''"doll"''. "El Shaddoll" is a play on ''"[[wikipedia:El Shaddai|El Shaddai]]"'', one of the Judaic names of God.
  Some cards' Japanese names associate the "Shaddoll" reading with the kanji 「影依」, which can be loosely translated as "Shadow Possessed".
  ===Members===
  ====DARK Main Deck Monsters====
  With the exception of "[[Shaddoll Zefracore]]" (who is a [[Rock]] monster), all [[DARK]] "Shaddoll" monsters are [[Spellcaster]] monsters.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Shaddoll" archetype is a [[Fusion Summon|Fusion]]-focused archetype, with a secondary focus on [[Flip Effect]]s. The archetype focuses on gaining advantage by using [[Main Deck]] "Shaddoll" monsters as [[Fusion Material]]s, and [[Summon]]ing the powerful "[[El Shaddoll]]" [[Fusion Monster]]s to suppress the opponent.
  The Main Deck "Shaddoll" monsters all have two effects (with an [[only 1 effect once per turn]] condition) that generate card or [[field]] advantage: a [[Flip Effect]], and a second effect [[trigger]]ed when they are sent to the [[Graveyard]] by a card [[effect]].

  The [[GY]] effects of the [[Main Deck]] "Shaddoll" monsters are relatively speaking the more important effects; their on-[[field]] [[Flip effect]]s, though more powerful, are much harder to [[trigger]] on the player's setup and are thus less reliable. For [[Fusion Summon]]ing, they can compensate for the heavy costs required for Fusion Summoning from the [[hand]]/field, as these effects can be triggered when "Shaddoll" monsters are sent to the GY as [[Fusion Material]]s when resolving a Fusion Summoning effect. They can additionally compensate for discards in card effects who require a discard at resolution, such as "[[Paleozoic Dinomischus]]", "[[Shaddoll Beast]]", or "[[El Shaddoll Grysta]]" and "[[El Shaddoll Shekhinaga]]".

  Their true importance comes in the fact that they are also triggered if they're sent from the Deck to the GY, such as with the effect of the archetype's core Fusion Summon [[Spell]], "[[Shaddoll Fusion]]", which can use monsters in the Deck as Fusion Materials: sending "Shaddoll" monsters directly from the Deck to the GY provides consistent card searches, and sending multiple "Shaddoll" monsters with single cards outright generates advantage instead of merely offsetting costs.

  [[Mill]]ing "Shaddoll" monsters can be performed with a variety of in-archetype and external cards: the major in-theme cards that do so are the aformentioned "[[Shaddoll Fusion]]", "[[El Shaddoll Construct]]", and "[[Sinister Shadow Games]]". Externally, cards such as "[[Mathematician]]" or "[[That Grass Looks Greener]]" can also perform this task efficiently. The best targets to send generally are "[[Reeshaddoll Wendi|Wendi]]", "[[Shaddoll Beast|Beast]]", "[[Shaddoll Falco|Falco]]", "[[Shaddoll Squamata|Squamata]]", and "[[Shaddoll Hedgehog|Hedgehog]]", who have advantage-generating GY effects. "[[Helshaddoll Hollow]]" can mill even more cards from the Deck when sent to the GY to potentially proc more "Shaddoll" effects. "[[Naelshaddoll Ariel|Ariel]]", who has a GY disruption effect in the GY, can also be a situationally beneficial milling target.

  The archetype contains 7 "El Shaddoll" [[Fusion Monster]]s. The 6 original "El Shaddoll" monsters each have a different Attribute (and also a different Level), and each require 1 "Shaddoll" monster + 1 monster of their Attribute as Fusion Materials. The last "El Shaddoll" monster, "[[El Shaddoll Apkallone]]", requires 2 "Shaddoll" monsters with different Attributes as materials. Their on-field effects generally focus on punishing the opponent's Special Summons, and each of them also have a floating effect.

  The two most commonly used "El Shaddoll" boss monsters are "[[El Shaddoll Winda]]", who is easy to Summon (since most "Shaddoll" Main Deck monsters are [[DARK]]) and has a powerful [[floodgate]] effect, and "[[El Shaddoll Construct]]", whose non-once per turn on-Summon effect generates massive amounts of advantage. Because of the importance of "Construct", "Shaddoll" Decks were historically ran with [[LIGHT]] monster engines, such as "[[Performage Trick Clown]]".

  To perform Fusion Summons of "El Shaddoll" monsters, the main Fusion Spell/Traps are: 

  *"[[Shaddoll Fusion]]", which can use materials from the Deck to generate advantage.
  *"[[El Shaddoll Fusion]]", a [[Quick-Play Spell Card]] which can Fusion Summon at [[Spell Speed 2]].
  *"[[Nephe Shaddoll Fusion]], an [[Equip Spell Card]] which can change the Attribute of the equipped "Shaddoll" monster, then Fusion Summon using the equipped monster.
  *"[[Shaddoll Schism]]", a powerful Continuous Trap that can Fusion Summon every turn using "Shaddoll" monsters in the GY, continuously making "El Shaddoll" monsters and further extending the Deck's grind game. After the "El Shaddoll" monster is Fusion Summoned, it can also send an opposing monster of the same Attribute as the Summoned monster, doubling as an effective removal tool. 

  Since the GY effects of the "El Shaddoll" Fusion Monsters and "[[Shaddoll Core]]" can recycle "Shaddoll" Spells or Traps, this ensures that the player can recover their tools needed to Fusion Summon again should their board gets wiped.

  The "Shaddoll" [[Link Monster]], "[[Shaddoll Construct]]", is primarily intended to be Summoned to the [[Main Monster Zone]] via its revival effect. Its first effect can free up the [[Extra Monster Zone]] via using itself as [[Fusion Material]], while its revival effect can trigger the effects of other "Shaddoll" monsters (though its [[Link Summon]] will not), and frees up to three zones for [[Link Summon]]s.

  <!--=== Invoked Shaddoll ===-->

  === Weaknesses ===
  *Since the [[Deck]] basically relies on [[send]]ing the "Shaddoll" monsters to the [[Graveyard]] in order to [[trigger]] their [[effect]]s, or [[flip]]ping them [[face-up]], cards like "[[Soul Drain]]", "[[Royal Command]]", "[[Abyss Dweller]]", "[[Armades, Keeper of Boundaries]]", "[[Majesty's Fiend]]", "[[Archfiend Black Skull Dragon]]", and "[[Gem-Knight Citrine]]" can be simple and effective. As the archetype is primarily comprised of [[DARK]]-[[Attribute]] monsters, "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" and "[[Stellarknight Constellar Diamond]]" can stop them from [[activating]] their [[Flip]] and [[Graveyard]] [[effect]]s. Redirecting cards sent to the GY to be banished instead (e.g. "[[Dimensional Fissure]], "[[Dimension Shifter]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]" and "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]") can also ensure that their GY effects never proc.

  *Additionally, one can also use cards that [[banish]] or return the [[Fusion Monster]]s to the [[Extra Deck]] to avoid the retriever effect. Due to cards like "[[El Shaddoll Winda]]", cards that can do this without the need to [[Special Summon]], such as "[[Compulsory Evacuation Device]]", "[[Phoenix Wing Wind Blast]]," and "[[Karma Cut]]," are recommended. 

  *The variety of [[Type]]s and [[Attribute]]s also makes the Fusion Monsters vulnerable to floodgate cards like "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]" and "[[Gozen Match]]". 

  *"[[Skill Drain]]" is also a viable solution as it counters the anti-[[Special Summon]]ing effects of the "Shaddoll" Fusion Monsters. This makes certain Decks that can use "Skill Drain" able to effectively bypass the "Shaddoll" [[Deck]]'s threats. Examples of such Decks include "[[Qli]]", "[[Malefic]]", "[[Dark World]]", "[[Scrap]]", "[[Archfiend]]", "[[Yang Zing]]" and "[[Zombie]]".
