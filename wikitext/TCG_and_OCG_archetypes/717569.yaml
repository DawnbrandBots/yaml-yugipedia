  "'''ZS -'''", short for "'''ZEXAL Service'''" in English and "'''ZEXAL Servers'''" ({{Ruby|ＺＳ|ゼアル・サーバス}} ''Zearu Sābasu'') in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] of [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yuma Tsukumo]] and [[Astral]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'', created through the power of [[ZEXAL (power)|ZEXAL]]. They were first introduced in ''[[Primal Origin]]'', but did not receive support until ''[[Lightning Overdrive]]''.
  All "ZS -" act as [[support]] cards for "[[Number 39: Utopia]]", its [[Utopia (archetype)|evolved forms]], and the "[[ZW -]]" archetype.
  In the English dub of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime, this archetype is either pronounced as an initialism<ref>{{episode|ZEXAL|123|ref}}</ref> (unlike "ZW -" cards) or entirely omitted when speaking the card's name.<ref>{{episode|ZEXAL|140|ref}}</ref> In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links]]'', it is spoken as "ZEXAL Service", although it is still spelled as "ZS -" in speech bubbles.
