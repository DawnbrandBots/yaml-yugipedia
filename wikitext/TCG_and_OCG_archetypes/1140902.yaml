  "'''Kewl Tune'''", known as "'''Killer Tune'''" (キラーチューン ''Kirā Chūn'') in the ''OCG'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Tuner monster]]s introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Phantom Revengers]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The ''TCG'' name of this archetype is a reference to "kewl", a nonstandard spelling of the word "cool", typically used in online culture.

  In modern English slang, aggressive descriptors like "killer" are often used to describe something positively; one might literally call a song they like a "killer tune". This is especially true in music production and DJ culture, where a track could be positively called "weapons" or "bombs" for the club. This also leans into the double meaning of the word, as many of the monsters are equipped with lethal weapons, and concept art refers to them having an "assassination mode" (possibly the Synchro Monsters). Many musicians also use "killer" or a variant of it in their alias.

  The archetype's name may also be a reference to ''[[wikipedia:Killer-tune|Killer-tune]]'', a song by Japanese rock band Tokyo Jihen.

  "Tune", while a musical term, also represents how this archetype solely consists of Tuner monsters, which is a first for the game.

  ===Appearance===
  The archetype is themed around the music scenes and cultures surrounding [[wikipedia:Record producer|music production]], [[wikipedia:Disc jockey|DJing]], [[wikipedia:Clubbing (subculture)|clubs]], [[wikipedia:Rave|raves]], and even [[wikipedia:Roller rink|roller rinks.]]

  "Kewl Tune" monsters have several features in common:
  * The monsters all feature outfits like those worn by club and rave-goers, alongside large, exaggerated versions of common audio equipment.
  * Some of the monsters have [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] [[Counterpart|upgrades]], which feature large weapons themed around the same equipment and flaming eyes. These Synchros share the same [[Type]] as their base form, but change the [[Attribute]] to [[DARK]].
  * A few of the monsters also wear skates, which are sometimes specialized for their unique roller rink. 

  "[[JJ "Kewl Tune"]]" reveals that Kewl Tune is the name of an underground club that the monsters frequent, which is further shown in "[[Kewl Tune Loudness War]]".

  The reference art for "[[Kewl Tune Reco]]" implies that all the monsters DJ at the club, which also features a roller rink that resembles a record. Reco has boots styled after the [[wikipedia:Magnetic cartridge|tonearm and cartridge]] of a record player, and is able to use the needles on their heels to "skate" along the grooves of the record.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://ygorganization.com/reference-art-enneacraft-atori%cf%9d-mar-killer-tune-reco/ | title = [Reference Art] Enneacraft – Atoriϝ.MAR & Kewl Tune Reco | author = Ness | website = The Organization | date = August 22, 2025 | accessdate = September 30, 2025}}</ref> The reference art for "[[Kewl Tune Rotary]]" notes that the members of the archetype work as actual assassins, with Rotary being recruited after she already killed their targets. <ref>{{cite web | url = https://ygorganization.com/reference-art-kewl-tune-rotary/ | title = [Reference Art] Kewl Tune Rotary | author = Ness | website = The Organization | date = January 18, 2026 | accessdate = January 18, 2026}}</ref>

  == Playstyle ==
  The archetype is focused around [[Tuner]] monsters; every monster in the archetype is a Tuner, every Synchro requires exclusively Tuners (no non-Tuners), and certain effects lock you into only Special Summoning Tuners.

  The Main Deck monsters share the following effects:
  * If this card on the field would be used as Synchro material, you may use 1 Tuner in hand as material.
  * An advantage-gaining effect on Summon OR an effect to Summon itself.
  * If sent to the GY as Synchro Material: [disruptive effect].

  The archetype also hosts a few Quick Synchro effects, including "[[Kewl Tune Clip]]", a handtrap usable on the opponent's Turn 1, "[[Kewl Tune Synchro]]", a twice-per-turn Quick Play spell, and "[[Kewl Tune Remix]]".
