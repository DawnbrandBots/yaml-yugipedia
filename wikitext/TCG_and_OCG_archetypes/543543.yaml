  "'''Battleguard'''", known as "'''Barbarian'''" (バーバリアン ''Bābarian'') in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] used by [[Joey Wheeler]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime, as well as [[The Sledgehammer]] and [[Grizzlepike Jones]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. Originally, one of Joey's "Battleguards" belonged to [[Tristan Taylor]], but he gave it to Joey before Joey's Duel with [[Rex Raptor]].

  Due to its Japanese name ("Bar''barian''"), the "Battleguard" archetype is a sub-archetype of "[[Barian (archetype)|Barian]]".

  All of their anime support that was released in the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'' was retooled to support [[Warrior]]-[[Type]] monsters, making "Battleguard" an anime-only archetype, until the release of the first ''OCG''/''TCG'' support card, "[[Battleguard Cadet]]", in ''[[Dimension Force]]''.

  == Playing style ==
  The most powerful "Battleguard" monsters are high-[[Level]], and focus on [[beatdown]] strategies, while the lower Level ones and their support focus on making the [[Tribute Summon]] of the high-Level "Battleguard" monsters easier, by [[Special Summon]]ing monsters, negating attacks or gaining control of the opponent's monsters.
