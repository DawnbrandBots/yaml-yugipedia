  "'''Tenpai Dragon'''" ({{Ruby|天|てん}}{{Ruby|盃|ぱい}}{{Ruby|龍|りゅう}} ''Tenpairyū'') is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Dragon]] monsters introduced in ''[[Legacy of Destruction]]''. It is closely related to the "[[Sangen]]" archetype.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  The theme's name is a play on ''tenpai'' (jp: {{Ruby|聴|テン}}{{Ruby|牌|パイ}}, zh: 听牌 ''tīngpái''), a term in [[wikipedia:Mahjong|mahjong]] that means "one tile short of a winning hand", but written with characters meaning "emperor's gift cup" in Japanese, and "God's glass" in Mandarin Chinese. A hand is recognized as ''tenpai'' when only one more tile is needed to complete it. It is an important concept of mahjong, as recognition of a ''tenpai'' hand allows the player to make the best decisions on which tiles to best discard.

  The members of the archetype are based on the ''[[wikipedia:Mahjong tiles#Dragons|Sānyuánpái]]'' (三元牌, lit. "Three fundamental tiles"), a group of three tiles used in mahjong. They are said to represent Heaven, Earth, and Man. Alternatively, it is also said that they represent the three core Confucian values. Western styles of mahjong refer to these three tiles as "Dragon tiles".

  Their names are also a play on ''[[wikipedia:Japanese mahjong#Dora|dora]]'' (ドラ), bonus tiles that add ''[[wikipedia:Japanese mahjong scoring rules#Counting han|han]]'' value to a winning hand. ''Dora'' uses the same kana as the first two kana used for "dragon" (<u>ドラ</u>ゴン '''''dora'''gon'').

  The name of the related "[[Sangen]]" archetype is taken from ''Sangenpai'', the Japanese reading of the aforementioned ''Sānyuánpái'', but written with characters meaning "brilliant apparition​". The name of each "Sangen" monster is a reference on a specific ''[[wikipedia:Japanese mahjong yaku|yaku]]'', a hand pattern or condition that determines the value of a hand in that game.

  ==Playing style==
  "Tenpai Dragon" is a [[Blind second|blind going second]] Deck that involves around swarming their Main Deck monsters onto the field, then repeatedly [[Synchro Summon]]ing "[[Sangen]]" [[Synchro Monster]]s and/or "[[Trident Dragion]]" in the Battle Phase, attacking repeatedly with these monsters until the opponent is defeated. "Trident Dragion" and both "Sangen" Synchros have effects that can destroy your own cards, allowing you to trigger the [[Field Spell]] "[[Sangen Summoning]]"'s ATK doubling effect, or send "[[Sangenpai Transcendent Dragion]]" to the GY so it can be re-summoned.

  Due to the small number of Main Deck cards required for this strategy, "Tenpai Dragon" Decks can run a large amount of staple cards, such as [[hand trap]]s to disrupt the opponent's plays, or powerful board breaker cards.

  After the deck's consistency was hit, it became an option to implement "[[Watt]]" cards to bolster consistency, with the added benefit of upping damage output.

  === Sample combos ===
  {{Combo steps

  # Attack directly with "Tenpai Dragon Paidra" (1700 damage).
  # Activate "Tenpai Dragon Paidra" effect, Synchro Summon "[[Trident Dragion]]" using "Tenpai Dragon Paidra" and "Sangenpai Bident Dragion" as Synchro Material.
  # Activate "Trident Dragion" effect to destroy "Sangenpai Transcendent Dragion" and "Sangen Summoning" from your side of field, allow "Trident Dragion" to gain 2 additional attacks.
  # Activate "Sangen Summoning" effect in GY to double "Trident Dragion" ATK to 6000.
  # Activate "Sangenpai Transcendent Dragion" effect in the GY, Special Summon itself from the GY to your side of field.
  # Attack directly with "Sangenpai Transcendent Dragion" and "Trident Dragion" three times. (3000 + (6000 * 3) = 21000 damage).
  }}

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = Going second, having "[[Wattcobra]]" in hand.
  | end     = Dealing up to 42300 damage (1000 + 800 + 1600 + 1500 + 1700 + 1500 + 1600 + 2600 + 1700 + 3000 + 2600 + 1700 + 3000 + (6000 * 3)) to your opponent clear field during [[Battle Phase]], result in [[One Turn Kill]].
  | steps   = 
  # Attack directly with "Wattcobra", add "[[Wattuna]]" to hand, summon "Wattuna".
  # Attack directly with "Wattuna", tribute "Wattuna" and "Wattcobra" for "[[Wattkyuki]]".
  # Attack directly with "Wattkyuki", shuffle back "Wattkyuki" and "Wattuna" for "[[Watthydra]]".
  # Attack directly with "Watthydra", banish "[[Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos]]" from deck, search "[[Tenpai Dragon Genroku]]".
  # Special Summon "Tenpai Dragon Genroku", tribute to summon "Tenpai Dragon Paidra"
  # Continue with the standard "Tenpai" combo as listed prior.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Being a blind second-oriented deck, "Tenpai Dragon" players often struggle to perform when being forced to go first without the help of external cards, lest they being on the receiving end of OTK in return. Due to the lack of [[Battle Phase]] on the first turn, "Tenpai Dragon's" endboard typically only consists of "[[Hieratic Seal of the Heavenly Spheres]]" and some non-engine interruptions.
  * Without "[[Sangen Summoning]]", "Tenpai Dragon's" game plan is easy to interrupt. "[[Tenpai Dragon Paidra|Paidra]]" is an easy target for hand traps like "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]", which ends the turn should there be no access to "[[Tenpai Dragon Chundra|Chundra]]".
  ** Cards like "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]" and "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]" can remove "Sangen Summoning" from play, making them easier to interrupt while staving off damage in the Battle Phase. However, the former can be played around through proper sequencing.
  ** Cards that force the opponent to send monsters to the GY, such as "[[Destructive Daruma Karma Cannon]]", bypass the protection of "Sangen Summoning".
  * Floodgates, such as "[[Skill Drain]]", "[[There Can Be Only One]]", "[[Secret Village of the Spellcasters]]", and "[[Dimensional Barrier]]", can impede or stop this Deck from performing an OTK.
  ** Graveyard floodgates like "[[Macro Cosmos]]" and "[[Dimension Shifter]]" are not 100% effective at stopping their strategy, though they do prevent "Fadra" and "Sangen" Synchros from Summoning more monsters.
  * As "Tenpai Dragon" Decks are reliant on the Battle Phase, battle tricks can interfere with their playstyle. 
  ** "[[Chaos Ancient Gear Giant]]" and "[[Firewall Dragon Darkfluid - Neo Tempest Terahertz]]" prevents monster effects from being activated / negates all effects activated in the Battle Phase, respectively, preventing "Chundra's" effect from activating and starting their Synchro climbing.
  ** Cards that limit attacks, prevent/end the Battle Phase, or prevent damage, such as "[[Threatening Roar]]", "[[Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir]]", "[[Vengeful Bog Spirit]]", "[[Artifact Ignition]]", or "[[Battle Fader]]", can prevent the OTK and possibly prevent the activation of attack-based effects. However, generic floodgates like "Skill Drain" are more effective overall.
  ** Cards that can negate during the [[Damage Step]], such as "[[Forbidden Droplet]]" and "[[Machina Ruinforce]]", are valuable for stopping the effect of "Chundra", though they are meaningless if "[[Sangenpai Transcendent Dragion]]" can be safely made during the Main Phase 1.
