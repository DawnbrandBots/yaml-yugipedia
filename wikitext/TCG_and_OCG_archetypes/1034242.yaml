  "'''Tenpai Dragon'''" ({{Ruby|天|てん}}{{Ruby|盃|ぱい}}{{Ruby|龍|りゅう}} ''Tenpairyū'') is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Dragon]] monsters introduced in ''[[Legacy of Destruction]]''. It is closely related to the "[[Sangen]]" archetype.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  The theme's name is a play on ''tenpai'' (jp: {{Ruby|聴|テン}}{{Ruby|牌|パイ}}, zh: 听牌 ''tīngpái''), a term in [[wikipedia:Mahjong|mahjong]] that means "one tile short of a winning hand", but written with characters meaning "emperor's gift cup" in Japanese, and "God's glass" in Mandarin Chinese. A hand is recognized as ''tenpai'' when only one more tile is needed to complete it. It is an important concept of mahjong, as recognition of a ''tenpai'' hand allows the player to make the best decisions on which tiles to best discard.

  The members of the archetype are based on the ''[[wikipedia:Mahjong tiles#Dragons|Sānyuánpái]]'' (三元牌, lit. "Three fundamental tiles"), a group of three tiles used in mahjong. They are said to represent Heaven, Earth, and Man. Alternatively, it is also said that they represent the three core Confucian values. Western styles of mahjong refer to these three tiles as "Dragon tiles".

  Their names are also a play on ''[[wikipedia:Japanese mahjong#Dora|dora]]'' (ドラ), bonus tiles that add ''[[wikipedia:Japanese mahjong scoring rules#Counting han|han]]'' value to a winning hand. ''Dora'' uses the same kana as the first two kana used for "dragon" (<u>ドラ</u>ゴン '''''dora'''gon'').

  The name of the related "[[Sangen]]" archetype is taken from ''Sangenpai'', the Japanese reading of the aforementioned ''Sānyuánpái'', but written with characters meaning "brilliant apparition​". The name of each "Sangen" monster is a reference on a specific ''[[wikipedia:Japanese mahjong yaku|yaku]]'', a hand pattern or condition that determines the value of a hand in that game.

  ==Playing style==
  "Tenpai Dragon" is a blind going second Deck that involves around repeatedly [[Synchro Summon]] either "[[Sangen]]" [[Synchro Monster]]s or "[[Trident Dragion]]" during the [[Battle Phase]], and then destroy these Synchro monsters or the field spell "[[Sangen Summoning]]" to trigger various effects, including special summoning these monsters again to repeat the attack until the opponent is defeated.

  Due to the Deck mainly set up their gameplan during the Battle Phase rather than the [[Main Phase]], the deck is capable of employing various floodgate cards to restrict the opponent into battling the "Tenpai Dragon" monsters and being damaged in return (especially when the player is going first). The small amount of Main Deck monsters also means that they can run any of several powerful staples and destruction tools to simplify the board state when going second.

  === Sample combos ===
  {{Combo steps
  | opening = Going second, having "[[Sangen Summoning]]" + 1 card in hand
  | end     = Dealing up to 37.400 damage (1.700 + 1.500 + 1.600 + 2.600 + 1.700 + 3.000 + 2.600 + 1.700 + 3.000 + (6.000 * 3)) to your opponent clear field during [[Battle Phase]], result in [[One Turn Kill]].
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[Sangen Summoning]]", add "[[Tenpai Dragon Paidra]]" and discard 1 card in hand.
  # Normal Summon "Tenpai Dragon Paidra", activate its effect, add "[[Sangen Kaimen]]" to hand.
  # Enter [[Battle Phase]].
  # Attack directly with "Tenpai Dragon Paidra" (1.700 damage).
  # Activate "Sangen Kaimen", add "[[Tenpai Dragon Chundra]]" and Special Summon it to your side of field.

  # Activate "Tenpai Dragon Chundra" effect, Synchro Summon "[[Sangenpai Bident Dragion]]" using "Tenpai Dragon Chundra" and "Tenpai Dragon Paidra" as Synchro Material.
  # Activate "Sangenpai Bident Dragion" effect, Special Summon "Tenpai Dragon Paidra" back from the GY.
  # Attack directly with "Sangenpai Bident Dragion" and "Tenpai Dragon Paidra" (2.600 + 1.700 = 4.300 damage).
  # Activate "Tenpai Dragon Paidra" effect, Synchro Summon "[[Sangenpai Transcendent Dragion]]" using "Tenpai Dragon Paidra" and "Sangenpai Bident Dragion" as Synchro Material.
  # Attack directly with "Sangenpai Transcendent Dragion" (3.000 damage).
  # Activate "Sangenpai Bident Dragion" effect in the GY, Special Summon itself from the GY to your side of field.
  # Attack directly with "Sangenpai Bident Dragion" (2.600 damage).
  # Activate "Tenpai Dragon Fadra" effect, Special Summon "Tenpai Dragon Paidra" back from the GY for the second time.
  # Attack directly with "Tenpai Dragon Paidra" (1.700 damage).
  # Activate "Tenpai Dragon Paidra" effect, Synchro Summon "[[Trident Dragion]]" using "Tenpai Dragon Paidra" and "Sangenpai Bident Dragion" as Synchro Material.
  # Activate "Trident Dragion" effect to destroy "Sangenpai Transcendent Dragion" and "Sangen Summoning" from your side of field, allow "Trident Dragion" to gain 2 additional attacks.
  # Activate "Sangen Summoning" effect in GY to double "Trident Dragion" ATK to 6.000.
  # Activate "Sangenpai Transcendent Dragion" effect in the GY, Special Summon itself from the GY to your side of field.
  # Attack directly with "Sangenpai Transcendent Dragion" and "Trident Dragion" three times. (3.000 + (6.000 * 3) = 21.000 damage).

  }}

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Without "[[Sangen Summoning]]", Tenpai Dragon is fairly linear; "[[Tenpai Dragon Paidra|Paidra]]" is an easy target for "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]", which ends the turn should there be no [[Tenpai Dragon Chundra|Chundra]] access. 
  ** Additionally, using "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]] on Sangen Summoning can stave off additional damage in the Battle Phase or allow for Main Phase interruption; however, the latter can be played around through proper sequencing. 
  * As "Tenpai Dragon" are reliant on the Battle Phase, battle tricks can interfere with their playstyle. 
  ** "[[Chaos Ancient Gear Giant]]" and "[[Machina Ruinforce]]" prevent card effects from being activated in the Battle Phase, preventing "Chundra" and "[[Tenpai Dragon Fadra|Fadra]]'s" effects from activating and starting their Synchro climbing. 
  ** Cards that limit attacks like" [[The Dark Door]]"," "[[Vengeful Bog Spirit]]" and "[[Synchro Zone]]" can prevent Tenpai from getting to the three attacks necessary to revive "[[Sangenpai Bident Dragion]]", often cutting off an OTK entirely. "[[Threatening Roar]]" prevents Battle Phase access entirely. However, cards like "[[Skill Drain]]" are usually more practical. 
  * Because the deck mainly consists of Dragon monsters, "[[There Can Be Only One]]" largely prevents snowballing should there be no extenders. 
  * "[[Gnomaterial]]" can situationally prevent Synchro climbing if used squarely on a lone "Chundra", though access to additional copies can result in an OTK regardless. Ergo, "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" calling Synchro will likely be more practical.
