  "'''Libromancer'''" (リブロマンサー ''Riburomansā'') is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]] [[archetype]] that was introduced in ''[[Battle of Chaos]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 11: Libromancer}}

  == Etymology ==
  "Libromancer" is a portmanteau of "libro" (derived from ''liber'', Latin for "book") and "-mancer" (a practitioner of a specific type of divination). In fiction, -mancer is a popular suffix used to denote a practitioner of a specific school of magic.

  == Design ==
  The members of the "Libromancer" archetype belong to various [[Type]]s and [[Attribute]]s, representing different types or genres of books.
  The "Libromancer" [[Effect Monster]]s appear to be modern humans with the power to manifest a character from their favorite books. The "Libromancer" [[Ritual Monster]]s appear to be the combined forms of these humans and their respective book character.

  == Playing style ==
  "Libromancer" is an archetype focused on successive [[Ritual Summon]]s and gaining effects when using monsters on the [[field]], such as protection from being destroyed or [[banish]]ed, or the ability to [[Direct attack|attack]] directly. The theme itself carries a solid control and slight [[beatdown]] playstyle as the player can disrupt the opponent through the effects of "[[Libromancer Doombroker]]" and the [[Trap Card]] "[[Libromancer Intervention]]".
  All non-Ritual "Libromancer" monsters share the following effect:
  # ''You can reveal 1 Ritual Monster in your hand: Special Summon this card from your hand.''

  As a Ritual based archetype generally requires an extensive amount of resources and searching, "Fire" and "Geek Boy" form the archetype's backbone for its non-Ritual members. Searching one another and other important pieces such as "[[Libromancer Doombroker]]" in conjunction with "[[Libromancer First Appearance]]". "Agent" allows for resource recovery, commonly retrieving previous "Fire" or "Geek Boy" to extend plays or for later turns. "Magigirl's" applications are more limited and niche. Her main claim is with summoning "[[Libromancer Mystigirl]]" to possibly interrupt an opponent during their turn, but the archetype has arguably better avenues to accomplish similarly with "[[Libromancer Intervention]]" and through generic options like "[[Dyna Mondo]]". However, due to their ability to place themselves on the board without any archetypal-restriction, all these cards are good towards facilitating [[Synchro Summon|Synchro]], [[Xyz Summon|Xyz]], and [[Link Summon]]ing if not used as material for their Rituals.
