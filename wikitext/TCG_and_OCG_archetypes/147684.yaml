  "'''Shien'''" ({{Ruby|紫|シ}}{{Ruby|炎|エン}} ''Shien'') is an [[archetype]] of cards related to the "[[Six Samurai]]", through "[[Gateway of the Six]]" and "[[Shien's Dojo]]". The Japanese [[effect]] text for those two cards specifies all cards in the "Shien" archetype must have 「紫炎」 in their Japanese names, with 「''シ''エン」 as furigana. For this reason, "[[Kagemusha of the Blue Flame]]" (「{{name|Kagemusha of the Blue Flame|ja}}」 "{{translated name|Kagemusha of the Blue Flame|ja}}") is a "Shien" card, while "[[Shien's Spy]]" (「{{name|Shien's Spy|ja}}」) is not.

  Some of the monsters are monkeys that aid the "Six Samurai", and the archetype as a whole largely serves as [[support]] cards for "Six Samurai".

  ==Etymology==
  "Shien" literally means "Purple Flame", so in the artworks of most "Shien" cards, there are purple/blue flames present.

  ==Trivia==
  * "[[Kagemusha of the Blue Flame]]" is the first card shown being played in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime.
  * "[[Barrier Ninjitsu Art of Transcription]]", "[[Blind Spot Strike]]", "[[Spy Attack]]", and "[[Debunk]]" suggests that "[[Ninja]]s" have some sort of rivalry with "Shien".
  ** However, with the exception of "Debunk" (which depicts an unknown ninja-like figure), all of these cards debuted in the anime before being introduced to the ''OCG''/''TCG'', making their canonicity questionable.
