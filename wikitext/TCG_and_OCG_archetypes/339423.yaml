  '''"Performage"''', known as '''"Entermage"''' ({{Ruby|Ｅｍ|エンタメイジ}} ''Entameiji'')  in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Dennis McField]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. They debuted in the set ''[[Clash of Rebellions]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  The "Performage" monsters's appearances are based on [[wikipedia:Circus|circus]] artists, such as [[wikipedia:Clown|clowns]], [[wikipedia:Harlequin|harlequins]], or [[wikipedia:Jester|jesters]] (with the exception of "[[Performage Wing Sandwichman]]", which resembles a member of the military). In addition, most of the monsters are based different circus performers, such as jugglers, flamer eaters, and trapeze artists.

  === Etymology ===
  "Entermage" is a portmanteau of the words "entertainment" and "mage". "Performage" is a portmanteau of the words "performance" and "mage", although in the English dub of the anime it is pronounced like "damage" instead.

  The archetype's naming scheme draws parallels with that of the "[[Performapal]]" archetype ("Entermate") and the "[[Cookpal]]" archetype ("Cookmate"). This archetype's Japanese naming scheme (abbreviated as "Em") receives a near-identical abbreviation with the Japanese name of the "Performapal" archetype ("EM") as well as featuring cross-archetype [[support]] with "Performapal" through "[[Bubble Barrier]]" and "[[Performage Bonus Dealer]]".

  == Playing style ==
  When the first three Effect Monsters were revealed, and the rarely seen or mentioned "[[Performage Stilts Launcher]]" (with "[[Performage Flame Eater]]" being the only native card that could trigger its second effect), they instantly became assets to "[[Chaos]]"-like and [[Rank 4]] based Decks. Two prominent examples were "[[Shaddoll]]" and "[[Nekroz]]" before both becoming restricted soon after the release of this archetype and "[[Elder Entity Norden]]". "[[Performage Damage Juggler]]" and "[[Performage Plushfire]]" can [[add]] "Performage" monsters from the [[Deck]] to the [[hand]] or [[Special Summon]] them from there, respectively.

  As a general rule of thumb, "[[Performage Trick Clown]]" should be the first to be Special Summoned or [[search]]ed as it can repeat itself when used as any kind of material for an [[Extra Deck]] Summoning, and if possible should use its effect only when "[[Performage Hat Tricker]]" is already on the field to negate the 1000 [[Life Point]] cost of "Trick Clown". It is difficult to make "Hat Tricker" reach 3300 ATK without multiple activations of "Plushfire", however.

  "[[Performage Mirror Conductor]]" is the Main Deck power play of the "Performage" monsters, with its [[Pendulum Effect]] able to bring a Special Summoned monster's [[original ATK and DEF]] to become equal to the lowest value of its [[ATK]] or [[DEF]], while its Monster Effect able to switch the ATK and DEF of a monster on the field. "[[Performage Trapeze Magician]]" allows the player's monsters to attack twice to try to achieve an [[OTK]], removing their own [[Xyz Monster]]s that have no materials, or destroying an opponent's monster in [[Main Phase 2]].

  "[[Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer]]" and its [[Synchro Monster]] counterpart, "[[Ignister Prominence, the Blasting Dracoslayer]]", have destruction effects to activate the Special Summoning effect of "Plushfire" and both the "[[Dracoslayer]]" and "Performage" archetypes can rapidly Special Summon monsters from the Main Deck. "[[King of the Feral Imps]]" can search the Level 4 Tuner "[[Masked Chameleon]]", "[[Jigabyte]]", and sometimes "[[X-Saber Palomuro]]" for "[[Naturia Beast]]" with "Hat Tricker". The combination of "King of the Feral Imps", "Performage" and "Dracoslayer" is commonly called "PePe & Pals" (short for "Performage" Pendulum).

  "[[Heroic Challenger - Assault Halberd]]" can search for "[[Heroic Challenger - Thousand Blades]]", which can be combined with "Trick Clown" to Summon multiple Rank 4 Xyz Monsters. This is known as the "[[Clownblade]]" engine.

  Historically, the "Performage" archetype was extremely effective when paired with the "[[Performapal]]" archetype. This combination of the two archetypes, also known as "PePe", would prove extremely powerful, and several of its key cards would be Limited or Forbidden in [[February 2016 Lists|February 2016]].
