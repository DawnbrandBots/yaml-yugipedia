  "'''Forbidden'''" ({{Ruby|禁|きん}}じられた ''Kinjirareta'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s sharing similar artworks and effects. They debuted in ''[[Raging Battle]]'' and received their first support in ''[[Soul Fusion]]''. 

  All the "Forbidden" cards focus on manipulating [[Monster Card|monsters]]' [[ATK]] (or, in the case of "[[Forbidden Scripture]]", ignoring changes in ATK and DEF during battles) and [[card effect]]s, either by granting monsters immunity or by negating their effects.

  The artworks of these cards all feature a woman in a white dress holding the item. The theme is also related to the "[[Darklord]]" archetype (owing to the "Darklord" cards introduced in ''[[Burst Protocol]]'' which also supports this archetype).

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Master Guide 4 card storylines#File No. 02: The Maiden Exiled from Paradise|The Valuable Book EX card storylines#No. 08: Condemned Witch}}
  Japanese media identifies the old man featured in the [[Solemn]] cards and "[[Forbidden Scripture]]" as God, who owns those items and is shown punishing the woman for taking them in "[[Solemn Scolding]]". She later becomes gradually more corrupted, her appearance progressing from "[[Condemned Maiden]]" to "[[Condemned Witch]]", and eventually "[[Condemned Darklord]]".

  == Origin ==
  Despite the Greek theme and appearance of each of the cards' artwork, the inspiration behind the archetype appears to have come from the 4 most notable holy relics of [[wikipedia:Christianity|Christianity]].

  == Playing style ==
