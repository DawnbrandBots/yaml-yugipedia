  "'''Ally of Justice'''" ({{Ruby|Ａ・Ｏ・Ｊ|アーリー・オブ・ジャスティス}} ''Ārī Obu Jasutisu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by the [[Ghost]] army, [[Diablo]], in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]''.

  == Duel Terminal story ==
  {{Main|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines#The Alliance of Justice|Master Duel card storylines#Alliance for Justice}}
  On this distant star, each tribe or clan fights to ultimately reign supreme. For the longest time, the war just waged on, with no one group holding the advantage. However, this battle that no one thought would ever end was suddenly brought to an abrupt halt, as the "[[Worm]]s", invaders from outer space, suddenly crashed on the planet.
  To combat the invaders, the tribes and clans were forced to form a truce and unite together. The four tribes that were the most powerful forces on the continent form their own organization, "Ally of Justice". Bringing together each of their technologies and crafts, they began to develop anti-Worm weapons.

  == Playing style ==
  "Ally of Justice" is an archetype that specifically targets [[LIGHT]] monsters; most cards ''require'' the opponent to be using LIGHT monsters to have a useful effect. This is unique for an archetype, but due to this very specific focus, its low power level (even for the time), and a lack of support, the archetype as a whole saw no competitive success.

  Because the only cards that support "Ally of Justice" directly are those that give battle-related boosts, it is difficult to build a "pure" "Ally of Justice" Deck. Instead, the archetype can be ran as generic, tech-able options in the [[Side Deck]] to counter LIGHT Decks, since the cards are equally effective when splashed into other Decks.

  A few Ally of Justice monsters saw competitive play in other Decks:
  * "[[Ally of Justice Catastor]]" is the most played monster of the archetype, as it is a generic Level 5 [[Synchro]] that destroys a non-DARK monster at the start of the Damage Step (without targeting), giving a way to out high ATK monsters.
  * "[[Ally of Justice Cycle Reader]]" is a [[handtrap]] that banishes up to 2 [[LIGHT]] monsters from the GY, making it a feasible [[Side Deck]] option if a [[LIGHT]] Deck (such as "[[Lightsworn]]", "[[Blue-Eyes]]", or "[[Drytron]]") is prevalent.
  * "[[Ally of Justice Quarantine]]" prevents Special Summoning LIGHT monsters, making it a potent floodgate.

  In the [[Speed Duel]] format, "[[Ally of Justice Clausolas]]" is used as the central monster in "[[Spell Proof Armor]]" decks. "[[Ally of Justice Core Destroyer|Core Destroyer]]" is one of the best removal cards available against LIGHT monsters, such as "[[A-to-Z|XYZ]]" Decks or "[[Kaiser Glider]]".

  As for dedicated "Ally of Justice" decks, "[[DNA Transplant]]" can be used to make all opposing monsters to LIGHT to allow "Ally of Justice" Monsters access to their effects. The deck also synergizes well with "[[Orcust]]" cards, with "[[Orcust Crescendo|Crescendo]]" being able to search any Ally of Justice. "[[Kaiju]]" can also replace an opponent's monster with a LIGHT Monster, although both of these are larger than any unboosted "Ally of Justice". The same can be said of the potentially more disruptive "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]". Another recent option to be combined with "Ally of Justice" are the "[[Gizmek]]" cards, with some members being able to be recruited to hand by "[[Sacred Scrolls of the Gizmek Legend]]" while the main Gizmek Monsters don't detract from "Ally of Justice's" power.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As an archetype meant for the [[Duel Terminal]] machines (which had a much lower power level than the ''OCG''/''TCG'', even for the time), it struggles with some core issues relating to Deck strength. It has also received no new cards since "[[Ally of Justice Decisive Armor]]" in 2010.
  ** The only cards that support the "Ally of Justice" archetype are those that provide battle buffs. This means there is no way to search or Special Summon members of the archetype.
  * "Ally of Justice" monsters have a hard time against high stat lines, since they have low ATK and don't have many destruction effects. 
  ** Even [[LIGHT]]-reliant Decks can beat the archetype's monsters in battle. A LIGHT Monster with 1900 ATK is difficult to deal with, requiring "[[Ally of Justice Core Destroyer]]", a Tribute Summon/Synchro, or an external card like "[[Limiter Removal]]" to destroy.
  * "[[Acid Rain]]", "[[Magnetic Mosquito]]" and "[[System Down]]" also hurt the deck because they clear the field of all [[Machine]] monsters on the field (especially "[[System Down]]" because it [[Banish|banishes]] them).
