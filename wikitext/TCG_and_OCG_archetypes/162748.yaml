  "'''Wind-Up'''" (ゼンマイ ''Zenmai'') is an [[archetype]] of wind-up toy-like [[Monster Card|monsters]] that premiered in ''[[Generation Force]]'' and received further support in ''[[Photon Shockwave]]'' and ''[[Order of Chaos]]''. There are monsters of all [[Attribute]]s, though [[EARTH]] is the most prominent.

  == Playing style ==
  "Wind-Up" is an Xyz-focused Deck which uses a variety of single-use monster effects to control the field while "[[Wind-Up Factory]]" generates [[hand advantage]]. Most cards do not have hard [[once per turn]] effects; instead, the Main Deck monsters have "once while on the field" effects, with many support cards flipping down the monsters or otherwise resetting their effects.

  Before the limitation and eventual ban on "[[Wind-Up Carrier Zenmaity]]", "Wind-Up" was most feared for its ability to hand loop the opponent. "Carrier Zenmaity" (on field) and "[[Wind-Up Hunter]]" (in GY) were needed for this combo. Use "Zemaity" to summon "Wind-Up Rat" and use it to summon "Wind-Up Hunter". Use Hunter to Tribute "Zemaity" and force a discard. Then make a new "Zemaity" using "Hunter" and "Rat". This can be repeated two more times by default; cards like "[[Pot of Avarice]]" or "[[Daigusto Emeral]]" could be used to repeat the loop even more.

  After the limit on "Zenmaity", it became a Deck based around general Xyz Summoning and using "Factory" for advantage.

  ! Description
  |-
  | [[Wind-Up Rabbit]]
  | Can banish a monster you control until the End Phase, which can reset "Wind-Up" monster effects, activate "Factory", or protect itself.
  |-
  | [[Wind-Up Rat]]
  | Can Special Summon a "Wind-Up" monster from the GY.
  |-
  | [[Wind-Up Magician]]
  | When a "Wind-Up" monster effect is activated, can Special Summon a "Wind-Up" from Deck.
  |-
  | [[Wind-Up Honeybee]]
  | When destroyed by battle, Special Summons a Level 4 or lower "Wind-Up" from Deck.
  |-
  | [[Wind-Up Shark]]
  | A critical extender; it can Special Summon itself if a "Wind-Up" is summoned, and can change its level to 3 or 5, easily enabling Xyz from Rank 3-5.
  |-
  | [[Wind-Up Zenmaines]]
  | A generic Rank 3 with limited destruction protection, and punishes the opponent for trying to destroy it. In slower formats around the time, this was one of the best things to summon Turn 1.
  |-
  | [[Wind-Up Zenmaister]]
  | A generic Rank 4 that can flip a monster you control face-down, then flips it up during the End Phase.
  |-
  | [[Wind-Up Arsenal Zenmaioh]]
  | A generic Rank 5 that can destroy 2 Set cards.
  |-
  | [[Wind-Up Carrier Zenmaity]]
  | Can Special Summon a "Wind-Up" from Deck. In addition to activating the hand loop, it can [[Toolbox]] the other "Wind-Ups", such as "Wind-Up Soldier" to kill low-Level beatsticks, "[[Wind-Up Juggler|Juggler]]" to break walls, "Kitten" to deal with [[Extra Deck]] monsters and defuse [[Flip Effect]]s, "Rat" to produce Rank 3 Xyzs, "[[Wind-Up Rabbit|Rabbit]]" for reuse and deflection, or "[[Wind-Up Knight|Knight]]" for defense. Banned in the ''TCG'' as of the [[March 2013 Lists]].
  |-
  | [[Wind-Up Factory]]
  | If a "Wind-Up" monster uses its effect, searches for a "Wind-Up" monster on a soft once per turn, giving constant advantage and recursion if the game wasn't won turn 1.
  |}

  While not part of the archetype, "[[Tour Guide From the Underworld]]" was one of the best Normal Summons for the time, able to easily get out "Zenmaines" or "Carrier Zenmaity".

  ===Weaknesses===
  * The Deck is very old (latest support released in 2018; all but two cards were released in 2012 or earlier), so it cannot handle modern combo Decks, especially since "[[Wind-Up Carrier Zenmaity]]" is still banned to this day.
  * For combo-heavy "Wind-Up" decks, cards that counteract field swarming, such as "[[Torrential Tribute]]", "[[Maxx "C"]]", "[[Effect Veiler]]", "[[Needle Ceiling]]" and even "[[Summon Limit]]" and "[[Summon Breaker]]" can be powerful disruptions if activated at the right time.
  * Floodgates like "[[Skill Drain]]",  "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]", and "[[Gozen Match]]" (since "Wind-Up" uses different Types/Attributes) are very effective.

  == Trivia ==
  * An actual wind-up toy is wound up (Summoning it), does what the toy was made to do (activating the effect), then is completed (effect can only activate once). Returning to hand or flipping it face-down and back up signifies "winding-up" the monster.
