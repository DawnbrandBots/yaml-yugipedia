  "'''/Assault Mode'''", known as "'''/Buster'''" ({{Ruby|／|スラッシュ}}バスター ''Surasshu Basutā'', read outloud as "Slash Buster") in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Effect Monster]]s that are powered-up versions of already-existing [[Synchro Monster]]s, which are [[Special Summon]]ed by using "[[Assault Mode Activate]]", "[[Assault Mode Zero]]" or "[[Assault Reboot]]" on the corresponding Synchro Monsters. Those versions have the same name as its counterpart, but with "/Assault Mode" at the end. Both [[Yusei Fudo]] and [[Jack Atlas]] used the "/Assault Mode" counterparts of their monsters in the non-canon episode ''[[Evolving Duel! Stardust VS Red Demons]]''.

  == Etymology ==
  According to [[Dan Scheidegger]], the archetype was localized to "/Assault Mode" in order to convey a greater sense of power.<ref>http://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?p=11236784#post11236784</ref>

  == Design ==
  Aesthetically, the "/Assault Mode" monsters are re-armored [[counterpart]]s of the original monster. Certain small details other than "armor" change in the monsters design when they are transformed into their "/Assault Mode" forms but the overall design of the original is kept intact.

  Each monster has 500 more [[Original ATK and DEF|ATK and DEF]] than its original version, its [[Level]] is 2 higher (except "[[T.G. Halberd Cannon/Assault Mode]]", as its original is already at the maximum Level of 12), and Special Summons its original version when destroyed. Their effects are also generally more powerful versions of the originals'.

  The support Tuners of the archetype appear to be servants of "/Assault Mode" monsters that are based on ''OCG''-original Synchro Monsters, as they share the same aesthetic as them and are depicted guarding their armors.

  == Playing style ==
  The gimmick of the archetype is to Summon a Synchro monster, then use a Spell/Trap to summon the "/Assault Mode" Main Deck monster. This comes with a few inherent issues. It was inconsistent, since the "/Assault Mode" monsters are bricks in hand, and the Spells/Traps require the monsters in specific locations ("[[Assault Mode Activate]]" is a Trap that summons from Deck, "[[Assault Mode Zero]]" is a Spell that summons from hand). The process of summoning the Synchro, searching "[[Assault Mode Activate]]", and then waiting a turn was also high investment.

  The original wave of cards saw a brief stint in play when "[[Dragon Ruler]]s" were dominant; the Deck could easily summon "[[Stardust Dragon]]", while "[[Assault Beast]]" and "[[Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode]]" can be used as discard/banish fodder for the "Rulers".

  More recent support has alleviated the above issues:
  * "[[Psi-Reflector]]" is key to the modern strategy. It can search any card that mentions "Assault Mode Activate". Also, by revealing that Trap in hand, it can Special Summon a [[Non-Tuner monster|Non-tuner]] that mentions it from the GY, then change its level to 1-4.
  ** "[[Assault Beast]]" is the main search target, as it both searches "Assault Mode Activate" and sends itself to the GY to be Summoned back with "Psi-Reflector". 
  ** "[[Assault Sentinel]]", "[[One for One]]", and "[[Emergency Teleport]]" can Special Summon "Psi-Reflector" from the Deck to start using it quickly. The former can also change a monster's [[Type]] and [[Attribute]] to meet the material restrictions for monsters like "[[Arcanite Magician]]", and can be searched with "[[Fire Formation - Tenki]]".

  The above cards can be used as a generic engine that can Synchro Summon any monster from Level 5 to 9 (without intending to summon an "/Assault Mode" monster), such as "[[Naturia Beast]]", "[[Michael, the Arch-Lightsworn]]", or "[[Hi-Speedroid Kitedrake]]".

  === Monsters ===
  "/Assault Mode" monsters are related to their base counterparts, so many require different strategies to use their full potential.
  * "[[Arcanite Magician/Assault Mode]]": Works best in a [[Spell Counter]] Deck. In addition to the "Assault Sentinel" to "Psi-Reflector" combo, "[[Arcanite Magician]]" can be more easily Synchro Summoned using "[[Magical Exemplar]]". "[[Magical Citadel of Endymion]]" can also substitute a Spell Counter needed to activate its effect so it can maintain its high ATK. After it's destroyed and sent to the GY, where it would be unable to do anything, it can be fused to a [[Spellcaster]] Synchro Monster using "[[Miracle Synchro Fusion]]" to [[Fusion Summon]] "[[Supreme Arcanite Magician]]".
  * "[[Colossal Fighter/Assault Mode]]": Works best in a [[Warrior]] Deck. Warrior monsters that can quickly send other Warriors to the GY, such as "[[Armageddon Knight]]", "[[Dark Grepher]]" or "[[Vision HERO Vyon]]", can be particularly useful. "[[T.G. Striker]]" is an additional [[Tuner monster]] that can Special Summon itself, and can Synchro Summon "[[Colossal Fighter]]" by using it with "[[Destiny HERO - Malicious]]". Since it lowers the opponent's ATK, it's useless against [[Defense Position]] monsters, so "[[Final Attack Orders]]" can help.
  * "[[Doomkaiser Dragon/Assault Mode]]": It and "[[Doomkaiser Dragon]]" can Special Summon [[Zombie]] monsters from the opponent's GY, they fit best in a Deck built around "[[Zombie World]]". Since "[[Doomkaiser Dragon]]" requires "[[Plaguespreader Zombie]]" as its Tuner, "[[Psi-Reflector]]" cannot be used to Synchro Summon it. Furthermore, since its effect destroys the Summoned monsters during the [[End Phase]], the monsters should be used as material for additional [[Extra Deck]] monsters before then.
  * "[[Hyper Psychic Blaster/Assault Mode]]": Works best in a [[Psychic]] Deck. In addition to the "Assault Sentinel" to "Psi-Reflector" combo, "[[Hyper Psychic Blaster]]" can be Synchro Summoned by using "[[Overdrive Teleporter]]" to Special Summon a Level 3 Psychic Tuner from the Deck.
  * "[[T.G. Halberd Cannon/Assault Mode]]": The hardest "/Assault Mode" monster to Summon due to its original counterpart requiring 3 Synchro Monsters as material. Likely requires a dedicated swarm Deck to Summon reliably, or can be Summoned using "[[Assault Reboot]]".
  * "[[Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode]]" and "[[Red Dragon Archfiend/Assault Mode]]": The most flexible "/Assault Mode" monsters due to their generic effects and original forms requiring generic materials. Any strategy focused on Level 8 Synchro Monsters, such as "[[Resonator]]" or "[[Synchron]]", can work well with these cards.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As a Synchro archetype, it can be cut off by anti-Synchro / anti-Special Summon cards like "[[Dimensional Barrier]]".
  * "[[Psi-Reflector]]" is a key chokepoint that can be stopped by many common handtraps. "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" can also be used to negate "Assault Mode Activate".
  * If a Synchro Monster is banished or shuffled into the Deck, it can't be Special Summoned by its "/Assault Mode" form. Non-destruction removal will also prevent the "/Assault Mode" monster from Special Summoning its original form.
