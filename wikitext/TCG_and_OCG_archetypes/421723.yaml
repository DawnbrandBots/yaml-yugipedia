  "'''Kaiju'''" ({{Ruby|壊|かい}}{{Ruby|獣|じゅう}} ''Kaijū'' in Japanese) is an [[archetype]] of high-[[Level]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with different [[Attribute]]s and [[Type]]s introduced in ''[[Clash of Rebellions]]''. It is one of two [[TCG Exclusive|''TCG''-exclusive]] archetypes that premiered in that set, the other being the "[[Kozmo]]" archetype.
  The archetype is focused on Special Summoning "Kaiju" monsters to the opponent's field by tributing the opponent's monsters. This ability makes the archetype extremely potent at removing opposing monsters regardless of the amount of protection they have, and the archetype's members are commonly employed as staple removal cards in other decks.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  Each "Kaiju" monster is based on a monster from different [[wikipedia:Kaiju|kaiju]] franchises, such as ''[[wikipedia:Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Ultraman (franchise)|Ultraman]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Gamera|Gamera]]''. Their Field Spell represents a common setting for the movies, while the other Spell/Trap Cards seem to be common scenes in these movies.

  === Etymology ===
  Kaiju is a Japanese term meaning "strange beast" or "monster", frequently used to describe giant monsters from movies. However, the Japanese archetype name is a pun, as it is written as 「壊獣」 instead of 「怪獣」 , with a Kanji for "destruction" replacing the one for "strange".

  == Playing style ==
  The "Kaiju" archetype is divided into the "Kaiju" monsters proper, and the "Super Anti-Kaiju War Machine" monsters "[[Super Anti-Kaiju War Machine Mecha-Dogoran|Mecha-Dogoran]]" and "[[Super Anti-Kaiju War Machine Mecha-Thunder-King|Mecha-Thunder-King]]". All "Kaiju" monsters have an [[Control only one|archetype side-unique condition]], meaning that only one face-up "Kaiju" monster at most can be present on one player's field.
  The main "Kaiju" monsters all share two [[Summon monster effect]]s:
  {{Quote|
  # ''"You can Special Summon this card (from your hand) to your opponent's field in Attack Position, by Tributing 1 monster they control."''
  # ''"If your opponent controls a "Kaiju" monster, you can Special Summon this card (from your hand) in Attack Position."''
  }}
  The first effect functions similarly to the Summoning procedures of "[[Lava Golem]]" and "[[Volcanic Queen]]" (as well as the effect of "[[Santa Claws]]"), and is a powerful method of generic removal that can Tribute away almost any monster in the game, including monsters with full effect immunity like "[[Raidraptor - Ultimate Falcon]]". Unlike those three however, "Kaiju" monsters have far less restrictions and negatives ("Volcanic Queen" and "Lava Golem" both prevent Normal Summons/Sets, and "Santa Claws" gives the opponent a draw), making them far more effective as generic removal [[staple]]s. Due to the side-unique condition though, they can only get rid of one of those problematic monsters at a time.

  The second effect, meanwhile, lets a "Kaiju"-focused deck easily summon a high-Level high-ATK beatstick after summoning a "Kaiju" to the opponent's field. This sets up a "Kaiju" on the player's field, allowing a "Kaiju"-focused deck to utilize their actual monster effects and attack with them.

  Each main "Kaiju" also has a third monster effect (their "main" monster effect), all of which involve the use of [[Kaiju Counter]]s, which are only produced by "[[Kyoutou Waterfront]]", "[[The Kaiju Files]]", and "[[Kaiju Capture Mission]]". Notably, these effects remove Kaiju Counters as cost from "anywhere on the field", meaning that the opponent can use the player's Kaiju Counters to activate their "Kaiju" monster's effects.

  | [[Thunder King, the Lightningstrike Kaiju|Thunder King]] || {{Attribute|LIGHT|size=24}} || 9 || 3300 || 3 [[File:KaijuCounter-DULI.png|15px|link=Kaiju Counter]] || ([[Once per turn|OPT]]) Your opponent cannot activate cards/effects this turn, and this card can attack 3 monsters this turn.
  |}
  The "Super Anti-Kaiju War Machine" monsters, "[[Super Anti-Kaiju War Machine Mecha-Dogoran|Mecha-Dogoran]]" and "[[Super Anti-Kaiju War Machine Mecha-Thunder-King|Mecha-Thunder-King]]", lack the standard "Kaiju" effects, and have more interesting "Kaiju"-adjacent effects.
  * "Mecha-Dogoran" can Special Summon itself to the player's field if the opponent controls a "Kaiju", and can remove 2 Kaiju Counters to equip a "Kaiju" from hand or GY to it, with it gaining the combined ATK of the "Kaiju" monster it is equipped with, giving it high ATK over several turns.
  * "Mecha-Thunder-King" meanwhile is a specialized "Kaiju" counter, with a hand-activated Quick Effect that banishes an opponent's "Kaiju" that was Summoned to the player's field, and then revives a monster from GY, essentially making it a Quick Effect revival for a monster that's been Tributed by a "Kaiju".

  In terms of supportive Spell/Traps, "[[Interrupted Kaiju Slumber]]" is a "[[Dark Hole]]"-styled board wipe that then summons 2 "Kaiju" monsters from Deck, 1 on each side, and can banish itself from GY to search a "Kaiju", giving it significant value both for "Kaiju"-focused decks and general non-"Kaiju" decks as a staple board wipe. "[[Kyoutou Waterfront]]" is a Field Spell that can rapidly produce Kaiju Counters to activate "Kaiju" monster effects, and is also a searcher for "Kaiju" monsters, making it incredibly important in "Kaiju"-focused decks. "[[The Kaiju Files]]" and "[[Kaiju Capture Mission]]" are also Kaiju Counter producers, but are slower and have more situational additional effects.

  The "Kaiju" theme is almost completely incapable of swarming due to their side-unique condition, requires giving the opponent 1 potentially dangerous "Kaiju" to make any plays, and is wholly reliant on its Spells and Traps to generate card advantage, improve consistency, and generate Kaiju Counters to enable their monster effects. "Kaiju" decks are often played alongside other engines to minimize their weaknesses and maximize their strengths.

  }}

  A pure "Kaiju" deck has high board-breaking power as relatively few monsters in the game cannot be Tributed, and it can easily Special Summon high-ATK "Kaiju" monsters armed with strong monster effects that can control the opponent's field and prevent them from being able to mobilize. Pure "Kaiju" builds generally benefit from other cards that can negate or destroy opponent's cards in order to benefit from the full strength of "Kaiju" monsters, such as "[[Dinowrestler Pankratops]]" for removing problematic monsters or "[[Harpie's Feather Duster]]" for removing Spell/Traps.

  Cards that return opposing monsters to the hand, such as "[[Fairy Tail - Luna]]", synergize especially well with the archetype, as they can bounce the player's own "Kaiju" monsters on the opponent's field back to the hand in order to be reused to Tribute another one of the opponent's monsters.

  Most pure "Kaiju" builds either focus on having high draw power with cards such as "[[Sekka's Light]]" or "[[Trade-In]]" to generate card advantage, or on generating Kaiju Counters through cards such as "[[Kyoutou Waterfront]]" which can search out and enable the effects of "Kaiju" monsters.

  === Graydle Kaiju ===
  The "Kaiju" monsters hybridize well with the "[[Graydle]]" archetype, as the "Graydle" monsters focus on taking control of the opponent's monsters, allowing the "Kaiju" monsters to be used as quick spot removal and then reclaimed. The effect of "[[Graydle Dragon]]" can also revive "[[Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju]]" from the Graveyard when it is destroyed. Due to the heavy use of the "Graydles", which will often be used to take control of more than just "Kaiju", "Owner's Seal" and "Remove Brainwashing" are more detrimental than helpful. The "Graydle" monsters also give access to Level 8 Synchro Monsters and Rank 3 and 8 Xyz Monsters (the latter through use of overlaying both Level 8 Synchros and "Kaiju".)

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "Kaiju" monsters cannot Tribute monsters in the [[Extra Monster Zone]] if that player's [[Main Monster Zone]]s are all occupied.
  * This Deck focuses entirely on Special Summoning "Kaiju" monsters in order to win, so cards that disable or counter Special Summoning, like "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" or "[[The Last Warrior from Another Planet]]", can greatly hinder this Deck.
  ** "[[Fog King]]" and "[[Mask of Restrict]]" can also be used to hinder the Summons of "Kaiju" monsters, as their Special Summons require Tributes of the opponent's monsters. However, these cards cannot prevent "[[Interrupted Kaiju Slumber]]" from being used.
  ** As the "Kaiju" monsters consists of monsters from various Types and Attributes, "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]" and "[[Gozen Match]]" can also be devastating, as it will prevent the player from summon a "Kaiju" on the opponent's side if that monster is not the same Type or Attribute.
  * "Kyoutou Waterfront" is a key element of the Deck, as it can search out "Kaiju" monsters from the Deck once it has 3 or more Kaiju Counters (which can be easily accumulated in most situations). It can be difficult to eliminate, as it can also remove 1 Kaiju Counter from itself to prevent its destruction. However, Decks that are capable of Rank 4 Xyz Summons can use "[[Castel, the Skyblaster Musketeer]]" to dispatch it with ease. An alternate option is "[[Spiritualism]]", which can avoid negation by the effect of "[[Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju]]".
  ** "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]" can be used to banish "Kyoutou Waterfront", completely bypassing its protection effect.
  ** "[[Gate Blocker]]" can also be somewhat effective, as its effect will negate "Kyoutou Waterfront" and remove its counters as a result. While it may use up one's Normal Summon and be vulnerable in Attack Position, it also has some merit against the "Kaiju-[[Graydle]]" hybrid Deck by drawing the effects of "Graydle" monsters to itself.
  ** "[[Cursed Seal of the Forbidden Spell]]" and "[[Prohibition]]" can disable "Kyoutou Waterfront" near-permanently. "[[Spell Vanishing]]" is another option, although some "Kaiju" players will use cards that recover Spells from their Graveyard to counter attempts to destroy their Field Spell.
  ** Another option is to use a card effect to banish cards that would normally be sent to the Graveyard (for instance, "[[Banisher of the Light]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]", or the Pendulum effect of "[[Amorphage Goliath]]"). This will prevent "Kyoutou Waterfront" from accumulating Kaiju Counters, as well as limit the "Kaiju" player's ability to use the second effect of "Interrupted Kaiju Slumber" to search their Deck for more "Kaiju" monsters.
  * "Kaiju" monsters can activate their effects by using Kaiju Counters from ''anywhere'' on the field, so your opponent can easily use their effects against you (although "[[Kaiju Capture Mission]]" can hinder them by forcing the "Kaiju" into face-down Defense Position before its effect can resolve).
  ** In general, careful thought must be made when deciding which "Kaiju" monster you're going to give to the opponent - always make sure that you have a way to retake it or remove it before your opponent can use it against you.
  ** For this reason, if you intend on using cards that generate Kaiju Counters, it is not recommended to give the opponent "Kaiju" monsters with [[Quick Effect]]s and/or highly disruptive effects, such as "Gameciel", "Jizukiru", or "Kumongous". "Radian", "Dogoran" or "Gadarla" are recommended instead as the former two lack a Quick Effect to disrupt you during your turn, while the latter's Quick Effect of halving ATK/DEF is not highly disruptive compared to the remaining "Kaiju" monsters.
  * As the Deck is heavily reliant on Tributing opponent's monsters, this Deck heavily benefits from going second. Decks that do not generally focus on Summoning monsters (such as "[[Exodia]]) or do not keep cards in the Monster Zone during the opponent's turn (such as "[[Yosenju]]") are much harder for this Deck to play around.
  * Monsters that cannot be Tributed, such as "[[Eater of Millions]]" or "[[Quintet Magician]]", cannot be used to Summon "Kaiju" monsters, and thus must be removed from the opponent's field through other means.
