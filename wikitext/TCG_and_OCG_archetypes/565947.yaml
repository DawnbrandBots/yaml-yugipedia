  "'''Orcust'''", known as "'''Orphegel'''" (オルフェゴール ''Orufegōru'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Machine]] monsters that debuted in ''[[Soul Fusion]]''.
  The archetype is related to the "[[World Legacy]]" archetype, and is a part of the "World Legacy" storyline.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Master Guide 6 card storylines|The Valuable Book EX 5 card storylines#No. 11: The Knight of the Evening Star and the Automaton}}
  <blockquote>
  ; ''The Two Knights' Differences Collide''
  ''The "[[Crusadia]]" fellowship arrived at the place where the final battle would likely be fought. However, what awaited them was the "Orcust Army". The true identity of "[[Longirsu, the Orcust Orchestrator|Longirsu]]" is that of "[[Beckoned by the World Chalice|Ningirsu]]" who severed the bonds of friendship with [[World Chalice|his former friends]] and disappeared with [[Orcustrated Return|his own goals]] in mind. "Orcust" is an army of [[machine]]s he created to achieve his ultimate goal. The "Orcust" continue to ceaselessly appear from "[[Orcustrated Babel|Babel]]" and [[Orcustrated Einsatz|prevent the "Crusadia" fellowship from getting any further]]. [[Orcustrated Attack|These two former friends now wage a fierce battle against one another]].''<ref>https://ygorganization.com/mylittlesistercantpossiblybethisdead/</ref>
  </blockquote>

  == Etymology ==
  "Orphegel" comes from [[wikipedia:Orpheus|Orpheus]], [[wikipedia:Belphegor|Belphegor]] and 「オルゴール」 (''orugōru'', lit. "music box", borrowed from Dutch ''orgel''). The name links to the "World Legacy" story, where "[[Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior|Ningirsu]]" is paralleling Orpheus in his quest to revive a loved one. The demonic mechanical theme comes from Belphegor, who was said to lure people to sloth through the gift of knowledge to allow them to create great inventions, while 「オルゴール」 relates to the monsters' musical box design elements.<ref>https://ygorganization.com/dont-download-music-from-napsister/</ref>

  "Orcust" could come from [[wikipedia:Orcus|Orcus]], a Roman deity of the underworld, and "orchestra"; the word "Orcustrated" used in "Orcust" Spell/Traps is a play on "orchestrated".

  == Design ==
  "Orcust" monsters include musical instrument-shaped machines and humans/humanoids with characterization in the "World Legacy" storyline.

  The musical instrument-formed monsters are named after musical elements and have aspects of their eponymous musical instruments as part of their bodies.

  The character-based "Orcust" monsters are named after mythological figures. Many of the character-based "Orcust" monsters depict alternate forms of the character Ningirsu ("[[Beckoned by the World Chalice]]", "[[Ningirsu the World Chalice Warrior]]"); in lore, Ningirsu is the creator and the leader of the "Orcust" robot army. The other character-based "Orcust" monsters, as well as the related "[[World Legacy Token]]", depict forms of "[[Galatea, the Orcust Automaton]]".

  == Playing style ==
  The [[Main Deck]] monsters all have effects to [[banish]] themselves from the [[Graveyard]] to [[Special Summon]] other "Orcust" monsters from various locations, but prevent the player from Special Summoning monsters except DARK monsters for the rest of the turn. The [[Link Monster]]s all have diagonally opposing [[Link Marker]]s, any additional Link Markers are on the Top or Bottom. The Link Monsters each have an immunity effect when linked, and a second effect that must be activated by returning banished Machine monsters to the Deck.

  The main goal of the Deck is to banish the Main Deck "Orcust" monsters in order to activate their effects and provide Link Materials for the "Orcust" Link monsters in the process, as well as fuel for their effects. With this, the player can recycle those banished monsters to activate the effects of the Link monsters. Despite having [[Spell Speed 1]] effects, those Link monsters' effects become [[Spell Speed 2]] if "[[Orcustrated Babel]]" is active, adding a layer of disruption to the strategy. The blanket protection that prevents "[[Longirsu, the Orcust Orchestrator]]" and "[[Orcustrion]]" from being destroyed by card effects while linked makes it possible to safely combine them with cards like "[[Limiter Removal]]". Also, if backed by "Babel" and "[[Topologic Bomber Dragon]]", the Graveyard effects of the Main Deck "Orcust" monsters can be used during the opponent's turn and destroy the monsters in their Main Monster Zones.

  Alternatively, since the "Orcust "monsters are all [[DARK]], it can be used with "[[Phantom Knights]]" cards, with "[[The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche]]" having good synergy with "[[Dingirsu, the Orcust of the Evening Star]]" through summoning it to one of the zones that "Bardiche" points to (even on the opponents turn using "Babel" and "Cymbal Skeleton"). Historically, this could also be used to turbo out "[[True King of All Calamities]]" using "[[The Phantom Knights' Rank-Up-Magic Launch]]", locking your opponent from using [[Monster effect]]s.

  "Orcust" can also benefit from running a package of "[[Horus]]" cards, as they allow for discarding of "Orcust" cards to benefit off their Graveyard effects, and due to being Level 8 also allow an alternate way of summoning "Dingirsu". If using the "Horus", "[[Gimmick Puppet Fantasix Machinix]]" can also be used to search "[[Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force]]" and then sent to the Graveyard as Link Material during the "Orcust" combo, allowing it to be re-summoned to be used once again as Link Material after using the "Rank-Up" on "Dingirsu" to summon "[[CXyz Gimmick Puppet Fanatix Machinix]]" - thus giving the end-board an additional two disruptions on top of its ordinary ones. "[[Service Puppet Play]]" in the Graveyard can also be used to revive "Dingirsu" on the opponent's turn, freeing up "Cymbal Skeleton" to summoning something else.

  === Sample combos ===
  ;R.B. Hybrid Deck
  {{Combo steps
  | opening = [[Girsu, the Orcust Mekk-Knight]] + 1 card in hand
  | end     = [[R.B. The Brute Blues]] pointing to [[R.B. Ga10 Driller]] and [[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]] + [[R.B. Funk Dock]] + [[Galatea, the Orcust Automaton]] + [[Orcust Crescendo]] + [[World Legacy's Sorrow]]
  | steps   = 
  # Normal Summon Girsu and send [[World Legacy - "World Wand"]] to the GY
  # Girsu summon a [[World Legacy Token]] to each side of the field
  # Girsu = [[Galatea-I, the Orcust Automaton]]
  # Galatea-I send a card in hand to search [[World Legacy - "World Armor"]]
  # World Legacy Token = [[Clockwork Knight]]
  # Knight tribute Galatea-I to summon Wand from GY
  # Knight + Wand = [[R.B. VALCan Booster]]
  # Wand summon Armor from hand, and Booster search [[R.B. Funk Dock]]
  # Armor search [[World Legacy's Sorrow]]
  # Booster + Armor = [[R.B. The Brute Blues]]
  # Brute search [[R.B. VALCan Rocket]] (or [[R.B. Ga10 Driller]])
  # Funk Dock search [[R.B. Ga10 Cutter]]
  # Summon Cutter and Rocket to Brute's middle and right zones
  # Rocket pay 1000 to destroy itself and the opponent's token
  # Funk Dock gain you 500 LP and summon [[R.B. Ga10 Driller]] to the same zone
  # Banish Girsu from GY to summon Galatea-I
  # Banish Wand from GY to summon banished Girsu
  # Galatea-I + Girsu = [[Galatea, the Orcust Automaton]]
  # Galatea shuffle Wand to set [[Orcust Crescendo]]

  ===Weaknesses===
  * As all "Orcust" monsters are [[DARK]], the Deck can be countered by "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" or "[[Bystial]]" monsters.
  * "[[Orcustrated Babel]]" is a crucial card that enabled most of the interruption of "Orcust" monsters during the opponent's turn. Therefore, removing "Babel" (especially by [[banish]]ing it) can shut down most of the interruption the Deck can use.
  * Due to their [[Link Monster]]-centric gameplan, cards such as "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" or "[[Simul Archfiends]]" can slow down the "Orcust" gameplan.
  * Various anti-banish floodgates, such as "[[Artifact Lancea]]" or "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" can prevent the "Orcust" player from banishing their own cards for their effects. Conversely, anti-GY or forced banish floodgates such as "[[Macro Cosmos]]" or "[[Necrovalley]]" can be used to the same effect.
