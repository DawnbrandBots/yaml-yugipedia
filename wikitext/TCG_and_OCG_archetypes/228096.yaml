  "'''Zubaba'''" (ズババ ''Zubaba'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. These cards are used by both [[Yuma Tsukumo]] and [[Astral]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime, [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (manga)|manga]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL|spin-off manga]].

  == Playing style ==
  Zubaba is typically played alongside the other "[[Onomat]]" cards as part of a [[Rank 4 Monster Cards|Rank 4]] strategy, with "[[Zubababancho Gagagacoat]]", "[[Zubababa Knight]]" and "[[Utopic Onomatopoeia]]" helping swarm the field with Level 4s.

  The archetype can be split into two waves of monsters:
  * "[[Zubaba Buster]]" and "[[Zubaba Knight]]" are Level 3 monsters with [[battle]] effects, while "[[Zubaba General]]" is a generic Rank 4 that can attach a Warrior from hand/GY to gain its attack.
  * "[[Zubababancho Gagagacoat]]", "[[Zubababa Knight]]" and "[[Utopic Onomatopoeia]]" are more modern support cards that fit into a Rank 4 strategy.
