  "'''Firewall'''" (ファイアウォール ''Faiawōru'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Cyberse]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yusaku Fujiki]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]''. The first support for this archetype was released in ''[[Cyberstorm Access]]''.
  "[[Firewall]]" is not a "Firewall" card, because it does not have 「ファイアウォール」 in its Japanese name; however, because support for this archetype only supports monsters, this isn't an issue. All members of this archetype are [[DARK]] monsters, except for the [[LIGHT]] "[[Firewall Dragon]]".
  ==Appearance==
  Each member is a draconian cybernetic being. "Firewall" monsters generally have black bodies covered in various colours of lines such as blue, green, red or purple with predominantly silver armor. A number of the "Firewall" monsters either change the color of their body lines or alter their wings when they attack.
  ==Etymology==
  These monsters are named after a [[wikipedia:Firewall (computing)|firewall]] in computing.
  == Playing style ==
