  "'''Goblin Biker'''", known in the [[OCG]] as "'''Goblin Rider'''"  (ゴブリンライダー ''Goburin Raidā''), is a "[[Goblin]]" sub-[[archetype]] of [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 3 monsters with 0 [[DEF]] introduced in ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]''.

  This archetype is part of the "[[Sinful Spoils]]" storyline.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#No. 15: The Hidden Sinful Spoils}}

  == Etymology ==
  In the OCG, the reading "Goblin Rider" is applied to the kanji 「百鬼羅刹」, a portmanteau of 「百鬼夜行」 (''hyakkiyagyō'', [[wikipedia:Hyakki Yagyō|Night Parade of a Hundred Demons]]) and 「悪鬼羅刹」 (''akkirasetsu'', demons and [[wikipedia:Rakshasa|rakshasa]]).

  == Appearance ==
  Compared to the older "[[Goblin]]" monsters, "Goblin Biker" monsters feature the more modern [[wikipedia:Gremlin|gremlin]]-like design. Each "Goblin Biker" is smaller in size compared to the traditional "Goblin" monsters while having more animalistic features, such as very large rat-like ears and some having body parts of other animals. Each of them rides a tamed beast and wears a biker-gang-themed outfit.

  == Playing style ==
  "Goblin Biker" is a theme focused on their ability to swarm the [[Field|field]] with numerous "[[Goblin]]" monsters through not just their own effects if [[Normal Summon|Normal]] or [[Special Summon|Special Summoned]], but through a shared effect to [[Detach|detach]] 1 [[Xyz Material]] from an [[Xyz Monster]] on either player's field to Special Summon that monster to the player's field. As a result, the theme is able to create a variety of boards based on which Xyz Monsters are summoned to the field, usually benefitting most from those able to have many Xyz Materials to detach through their own effects.

  One of the main benefits of the theme is its [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card|Trap]] lineup that help to further benefit its Playing style. The [[Continuous Spell Card]], "[[Goblin Biker Grand Bash]]", is of particular note as it not only gives all "Goblin" monsters on the field more ATK and an additional Normal Summon, it contains the effect to target 2 "Goblin" monsters and either make the [[Level]] of one of the targets become the same as the other monster's Level or make both of their Levels become the combined total. This allows the theme to make a wider range of Xyz Monsters, most predominantly Rank 6 and 9 Xyz monsters, as well as expands their ability to [[Synchro Summon]] with the optional tech "[[Scrap Goblin]]" to make powerful Level 12 [[Synchro Monster]]s such as "[[Ultimaya Tzolkin]]" and even "[[Geomathmech Final Sigma]]".
