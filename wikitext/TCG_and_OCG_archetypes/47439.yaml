  "'''Mist Valley'''" ({{Ruby|霞の谷|ミスト・バレー}} ''Misuto Barē'') is an [[archetype]] of [[WIND]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] whose effects involve returning cards to their owner's [[hand]]. Many of them have their own effect(s) triggered when they are returned to the hand themselves, or involve returning one's own cards to the hand as a [[cost]] for triggering their effects. They were released to the ''[[TCG]]'' through ''[[Hidden Arsenal]]''.

  == Duel Terminal Storyline ==
  {{Main|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines|Master Duel card storylines#Alliance for Justice}}
  "Mist Valley" is one of the four most influential tribes of the Duel Terminal alongside "[[Ice Barrier]]", "[[X-Saber]]", and "[[Flamvell]]". During the "[[Worm]]" invasion, the four tribes created the [[Ally of Justice]] to repel off the Worms attacks. Later, the other three tribes started to change their vision, from destroying the [[Worms]] to capturing them and using them as a power source to empower the Ally of Justice armies. Disagreeing with this, the Mist Valley tribe left the other tribes and started to fight with their own power. Unfortunately, the Worms got the upper hand from the standing-alone Mist Valley tribe, which lacked the army and power to face the Worms. They later aligned themselves with the legendary [[Dragunity]] tribe who inhabited the [[Dragon Ravine|ravine]] next to them. Both tribes started working together to repel the Worms. The Mist Valley tribe later vanished due to the rampaging [[Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]] who was desperately released by the [[Ice Barrier]] tribe as a last resort to end the chaos in the Duel Terminal World, however, [[Gusto|their descendants]] emerges and inhabit the Mist Valley region, while defending the land from various intruders.

  == Playing style ==
  In particular, the only "Mist Valley" Synchro Monster, "[[Mist Valley Thunder Lord]]", is a very powerful and versatile monster in terms of its ATK and effect. By returning one card on your field to your hand, this monster's ATK increases by 500 to 3100, the highest ATK among common Synchro Monsters. Cards best to return include activated Continuous Spell or Trap cards like "[[Call of the Haunted]]", as well as used Effect Monsters. Also when combined with the "[[Blackwing]]" archetype, "[[Dark Simorgh]]" becomes very playable. This archetype also has swarm capacity thanks to cards like "[[Divine Wind of Mist Valley]]", "[[Reborn Tengu]]" and "[[Genex Ally Birdman]]". "[[Harpie Dancer]]" can also be a big support to this archetype.

  === Valley Synchro ===
  This type of the deck relies on swarming speed via the combination of "[[Divine Wind of Mist Valley]]" and "[[Mist Valley Thunderbird]]". This is done through the effect of "Thunderbird" who is automatically summoned after bounced to hand, followed by the summon of "[[Mist Condor]]" or "[[Genex Ally Birdman]]" from the hand. This will trigger the field effect while keeping "Thunderbird" due to its effect. Via the Field Spell's effect it's easy to search a "[[Reborn Tengu]]" from the Deck to perform a Synchro or Xyz Summon, Summoning another "Tengu" while keeping your hand size stable. In order to quickly set up your combos, some cards like [[Flying Kamakiri 1|Flying Kamakiri #1]] or [[Swallow's Nest]] can be used to deploy Thunderbird to your field quickly. With the release of [[Gusto]] archetype in [[Hidden Arsenal 5: Steelswarm Invasion]], this type of deck can be more consistent as the Gustos can provide some sturdy defensive line in case the combo doesn't run smoothly.

  === Avian Lock Down ===
  This deck focuses on using the [[Lockdown]] effect of "[[Mist Valley Apex Avian]]" with the effect of "[[Mist Valley Thunderbird]]", which Special Summons itself when returned to the hand. Apex Avian is the harder-to-summon monster, but the deck can employ cards such as "[[Tribute Doll]]", "[[Cost Down]]", or monsters that Special Summon themselves, such as "[[Genex Ally Birdman]]" or "[[Cyber Dragon]]". You can also Special Summon Apex Avian with cards like "[[Monster Reborn]]".

  With the release of ''[[Order of Chaos]]'', this type of deck can become more competitive, since it's now possible to merge some "[[Ninja]]" cards to strengthen this Deck, mainly "[[Ninja Grandmaster Hanzo]]" which can easily search for "[[Ninjitsu Art of Transformation]]". Set the Trap immediately and activate it during your opponent's [[Draw Phase]], summoning "Apex Avian" from your Deck.

  Remember that "[[Divine Wind of Mist Valley]]" and "[[Shrine of Mist Valley]]" are also counted as "Mist Valley" cards that "Apex Avian" can bounce in order to activate its effect. These Field Spells can be searched easily with "[[Terraforming]]" and if your opponent tries to destroy them, you can bounce them instead. It's better to use those cards than "Thunderbird", which is vulnerable to attacks.

  === Black Valley ===
  Black Valley Decks combine "Mist Valley" and "[[Blackwing]]" monsters. The Deck uses "[[Future Visions]]", "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]", and "[[Dark Simorgh]]" to force your opponent into a turn by turn lockdown where they can't set. Also, any monsters they Normal Summon will be banished the turn they are Normal Summoned, thanks to Future Visions. Due to the fact that many Mist Valley cards return cards back to the hand, you can use this to your advantage and return "[[Future Visions]]" to your hand to keep your opponent's monsters from returning to their side of the field. Mist Valley and Blackwings have many good Tuners, such as "[[Mist Valley Soldier]]"  and "[[Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind]]", which makes this Deck very Synchro-friendly. Most Mist Valley and all [[Blackwing]] monsters are [[Winged Beast]]-[[Type]] monsters so "[[Icarus Attack]]" is a good support card. Another card that could help this Deck is "[[Begone, Knave!]]", because many Mist Valley monsters (such as "[[Mist Valley Falcon]]", "[[Mist Valley Thunder Lord]]", and "[[Mist Valley Executor]]) can avoid this effect by returning it to your hand and you can reset it during your Main Phase 2. "[[Mist Valley Thunderbird]]" returns to your field when it is sent back to your hand can avoid it completely. "[[Mist Valley Apex Avian]]" can send another Mist Valley on your side of the field to your hand to negate its effect and keep it from returning to your hand. Many [[Blackwing]] monsters can Special Summon themselves from your hand to the field so they are not very affected either. The trump card of this Deck is "[[Dark Simorgh]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  This archetype does not have any swarming power outside of "[[Divine Wind of Mist Valley]]" (especially now that it is limited), therefore anti Field Spell support such as "[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]" and "[[Dust Tornado]]" can do well against them. "[[Effect Veiler]]" is surprisingly dangerous, allowing your opponent to ruin your play at any moment, such as when using "[[Arcanite Magician]]" and "[[Ancient Fairy Dragon]]". "[[Torrential Tribute]]" can also give the almost same result.

  For Apex Avian hybrid, it is important to Summon "[[Mist Valley Apex Avian]]" as soon as possible. While "[[Ninja Grandmaster Hanzo]]" can make this easier, "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" can be a nuisance if you don't have him early enough, as Hanzo cannot search "[[Ninjitsu Art of Transformation]]" while it is present on the Field. Any monster that have more than 2700 ATK and can be Summoned instantly (such as "[[Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning]]") can also problematic if you don't have any battle-protection for your Apex Avian.
