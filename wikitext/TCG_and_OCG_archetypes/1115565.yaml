  "'''Teleport'''" (テレポート ''Terepōto'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Normal Spell Card|Normal]] and [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s that supports [[Psychic]] monsters used by [[Sayer]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]''. The archetype debuted with "[[Emergency Teleport]]" in ''[[The Duelist Genesis]]'', but only received its first support much later in ''[[Duelist's Advance]]''.

  Because of the archetype's Japanese name, "[[Assault Teleport]]" is a member of this archetype while some previously released [[Psychic]] support cards like "[[Teleport]]", "[[Overdrive Teleporter]]", and "[[Battle Teleportation]]" are not.
