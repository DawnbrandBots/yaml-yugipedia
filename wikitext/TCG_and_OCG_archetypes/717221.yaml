  "'''Tri-Brigade'''" (トライブリゲード ''Toraiburigēdo'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Beast]], [[Beast-Warrior]], and [[Winged Beast]] monsters that debuted in ''[[Phantom Rage]]''.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX card storylines#No. 01: The Closed Land|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 01: The Decisive Battle of the Northern Land}}
  The "Tri-Brigade" monsters are part of the ''The Fallen & The Virtuous'' lore.

  ==Etymology==
  The name "Tri-Brigade" is likely a portmanteau of "tri" (referencing their 3 different [[Type]]s), "tribe", and "brigade". The most common kanji used in the Japanese names of the "Tri-Brigade" monsters is 「鉄獣戦線」 (''tetsujū sensen'', lit. "Iron Beast Frontline"), alluding to their use of masks and firearms to wage a guerilla war against the melee weapon-using "[[Dogmatika]]".

  ==Design==
  [[File:TriBrigadeShuraigtheOminousOmen-ConceptArt.png|thumb|left|200px|"Shuraig" and the Tri-Brigade Crest]]
  "Tri-Brigade" monsters are in the form of humanoid beasts and birds wearing masks or goggles, all of whom equipped with ranged weapons except for "[[Tri-Brigade Kitt]]".

  ==Playing style==
  The "Tri-Brigade" archetype revolves around Special Summoning [[Link Monster]]s by banishing "Link Materials" from their Graveyard, and performing combos with [[Beast]], [[Beast-Warrior]], and [[Winged Beast]] Type (nicknamed "tri-type") monsters.

  All Main Deck "Tri-Brigade" monsters (except "[[Tri-Brigade Mercourier|Mercourier]]") share the same following [[once per turn]] effect:
  :''You can [[banish]] any number of Beast, Beast-Warrior, and/or Winged Beast monsters in your GY; Special Summon 1 Beast, Beast-Warrior, or Winged Beast Link Monster from your Extra Deck, with [[Link Rating]] equal to the number banished, also you can only use Beast, Beast-Warrior, and Winged Beast monsters as [[Link Material]] for the rest of this turn.''

  This shared effect allows the "Tri-Brigade" archetype to easily Special Summon high-Link Rating Link Monsters with little loss to their on-field card advantage, as long as they have enough monsters in the Graveyard.

  The individual [[once per turn]] effects of the Main Deck "Tri-Brigade" monsters, in addition to their shared effects, are the following:
  {| class="wikitable sortable"
  |-
  ! scope="col" | Tri-Brigade
  ! scope="col" | Effect
  |-
  | [[Tri-Brigade Fraktall|Fraktall]]
  | The player can send this card from their hand or field to the GY to send 1 Level 3 or lower "tri-type" monster from the Deck to the GY.
  |-
  | [[Tri-Brigade Kitt|Kitt]]
  | The player can send 1 "Tri-Brigade" card from the Deck to the GY, except "Tri-Brigade Kitt", if this card is sent to the GY.
  |-
  | [[Tri-Brigade Nervall|Nervall]]
  | The player can add 1 "Tri-Brigade" monster from their Deck to their hand, except "Tri-Brigade Nervall", if this card is sent to the GY.
  |-
  | [[Tri-Brigade Kerass|Kerass]]
  | The player can discard 1 other "tri-type" monster to Special Summon this card from their hand.
  |}
  Using these four effects in sequence allows a repeatable and consistent combo to set up the Graveyard and perform a Special Summon of a Link Monster using the shared "Tri-Brigade" effect. With "Fraktall" in hand, "Fraktall" will discard itself and send "Kitt" to the GY. "Kitt" will activate to send "Nervall" to the GY. "Nervall" will activate to add "Kerass" to the hand. "Kerass" can be Normal Summoned or Special Summoned (with its own effect), and use its shared "Tri-Brigade" effect to Special Summon a Link Monster with a Link Rating anywhere between Link 1 to 3, as there are at least 3 "tri-type" monsters in the GY.

  Due of the importance of "Fraktall" as a starter for the entire combo, running "[[Fire Formation - Tenki]]" to [[searcher|search]] it is required.

  The "Tri-Brigade" Link Monsters provide the archetype with consistency, recovery, and disruption effects. Each of these monsters have two [[once per turn]] activated effects: one relating to Special Summoning a Level 4 or lower "tri-type" monster (save for "Shuraig" and "Arms Bucephalus II" whom instead have an effect to banish a card(s) on the field, and "Arms Mouser" which triggers on summon and sends from Deck/Extra Deck to GY), and one that is optionally triggered when the monster is [[sent]] to the [[GY]].

  {| class="wikitable sortable"
  |-
  ! scope="col" | Tri-Brigade
  ! scope="col" | Effect 1
  ! scope="col" | Effect 2 (If this card is sent to the GY: You can...)
  |-
  | [[Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom|Ferrijit]]
  | Special Summon a Level 4 or lower "tri-type" monster from the hand. The player can only use "tri-type" monsters as Link Material for the rest of the turn after activating this effect.
  | Draw 1 card, then put 1 card from the hand to the bottom of Deck.
  |-
  | [[Tri-Brigade Bearbrumm the Rampant Rampager|Bearbrumm]]
  | Discard 2 cards to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower banished "tri-type" monster.
  | Add 1 "Tri-Brigade" Spell/Trap from the Deck to the hand, then put 1 card from the hand to the bottom of Deck. The player can only Special Summon "Tri-Brigade" monsters for the rest of the turn after activating this effect.
  |-
  | [[Tri-Brigade Rugal the Silver Sheller|Rugal]]
  | Special Summon a Level 4 or lower "tri-type" monster from the hand or GY during the opponent's Main Phase with its effects negated, and it's returned to the hand in the End Phase.
  | Decrease the [[ATK]] of opposing monster's by 300 for each Monster Type the player controls, until the end of this turn.
  |-
  | [[Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen|Shuraig]]
  | The player can banish 1 card on the field if this card or another "tri-type" monster is Special Summoned to the player's field.
  | Add 1 "tri-type" monster from the Deck to the hand whose Level is less than or equal to the number of banished "tri-type" monsters.
  |-
  | [[Tri-Brigade Arms Bucephalus II|Bucephalus II]]
  | When a monster declares an attack, the player can banish "Bucephalus II" itself and all cards the opponent controls.
  | Send 1 "tri-type" monster from the player's Extra Deck to the GY.
  |-
  | [[Tri-Brigade Arms Mouser|Arms Mouser]]
  | f this card is Link Summoned: You can send 2 "Tri-Brigade" cards with different names from your Deck and/or Extra Deck to the GY, except "Tri-Brigade Arms Mouser", also you cannot Special Summon from the Extra Deck for the rest of this turn, except Beast, Beast-Warrior, or Winged Beast monsters.
  | You can target 1 face-up monster on the field; change it to face-down Defense Position.
  |}

  The "Tri-Brigade" [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card|Trap]] lineup focuses on supporting the general Link Summoning-focused playstyle for the archetype.
  * "[[Tri-Brigade Airborne Assault|Airborne Assault]]" Special Summons a "tri-type" monster from the Deck, providing more monsters for use as Link Materials.
  * "[[Tri-Brigade Rendezvous|Rendezvous]]" provides additional [[ATK]] and a [[Redirects destruction|destruction prevention]] effect in the GY.
  * "[[Tri-Brigade Stand-Off|Stand-Off]]" searches "Tri-Brigade" monsters.
  * "[[Tri-Brigade Hammer|Hammer]]" searches "Tri-Brigade" spells/traps and Link summons
  * "[[Tri-Brigade Roar|Roar]]" provides disruption
  * "[[Tri-Brigade Oath|Oath]]" Special Summons a "tri-type" monster from the hand or GY, and has a conditional Spell/Trap negation in the GY.
  * "[[Tri-Brigade Revolt|Revolt]]" is arguably the most important "Tri-Brigade" Spell/Trap card due to the amount of card advantage it generates. "Revolt" can [[Special Summon]] any number of "tri-type" monsters that are banished or in the GY, and then immediately performs a [[Link Summon]] of a "Tri-Brigade" Link Monster using only those monsters. Successfully resolving "Revolt" allows one to Link Summon a "Tri-Brigade" Link Monster on the opponent's turn (typically "Shuraig" for its disruption effect), recur banished "tri-type" monsters back into the GY (allowing for more activations of "Tri-Brigade" effects), and trigger the effects of "tri-type" monsters that activate if they are sent to the GY for more card advantage (e.g. the in-archetype "Nervall", "Shuraig", or "[[Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Raven]]").

  Due to the importance of "Revolt" to the overall resource strategy of the "Tri-Brigade" archetype, "[[Tri-Brigade Bearbrumm the Rampant Rampager]]" is almost always Summoned during a Turn 1 setup to search for "Revolt".

  The ability for "Tri-Brigade" to combo with any [[Beast]], [[Beast-Warrior]], and [[Winged Beast]] monsters gives it a wide range of options for comboing with other archetypes. Some examples include:

  * "[[Zoodiac]] Tri-Brigade": "Zoodiac" monsters can use their ability to [[Xyz Summon]] multiple monsters on top of a single "Zoodiac" monster to quickly set up the [[GY]] with multiple [[Beast-Warrior]] monsters for the "Tri-Brigade" effects. They also allow an easy access to a multiple-material "[[Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder]]" for board-clearing.
  * "[[Lyrilusc]] Tri-Brigade": Like "Zoodiac", "[[Lyrilusc]]" can also rapidly generate set up the GY with many "[[Winged Beast]]" monsters for "Tri-Brigade" effects. They also provide access to their own archetypal boss monsters, and "[[Tri-Brigade Nervall]]" synergizes especially well with them since "Nervall" is also a [[Level]] 1 [[Winged Beast]] monster.
