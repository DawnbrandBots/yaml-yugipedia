  "'''Numerounius'''", spelled as "'''Numeronius'''" (ヌメロニアス ''Numeroniasu'') in the English anime<!-- per the episodes' closed captions --> and in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] [[Xyz Monster]]s used by [[Don Thousand]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime.

  It is closely related to the "[[Numeron]]" archetype, containing its two ace monsters, though is not a sub-archetype due to the way their name are written in Japanese.

  == Trivia ==
  * The two monsters in this archetype are the only monsters to have a printed [[original ATK]]/[[DEF]] number (in the anime) with more than four digits. <!-- Infinity is not a number, so it doesn't have digits. -->
  * The two monsters in this archetype are similar to "[[Vennominon the King of Poisonous Snakes]]" and "[[Vennominaga the Deity of Poisonous Snakes]]", which are also the two [[ace monster]]s of a certain archetype ("[[Venom]]") yet do not belong to that archetype due to a slight alteration in their card's name. In both cases, the stronger of the two monsters possesses an [[Victory condition|automatic win condition]], and can only be [[Summon]]ed after the weaker one is [[destroy]]ed.
  ** In the case for "Numerounia", it also loses membership of the "[[Number C]]" archetype.
  * In English, "Numerounius" is pronounced with a [[wikipedia:long o|long o]] (/ˈnuːməroʊniəs/); in contrast, "Numeron" is pronounced with a [[wikipedia:short o|short o]] (/ˈnuːmərɒn/).
