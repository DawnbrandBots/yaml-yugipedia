  "'''Puppet'''" (パペット ''Papetto'') is an [[archetype]] that includes two distinct themes: 
  *[[wikipedia:Chess|Chess]]-themed [[EARTH]] [[Warrior]] monsters used by [[Reiko Kitamori]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! R]]'' manga.
  *[[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s that support "[[Gimmick Puppet]]s" (which were used by [[Quattro]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime). 
  Effects that support "Puppet" cards support only one of the two themes at a time.

  The only support for Reiko Kitamori's chess-themed "Puppet" archetype is "[[Promotion]]", which only affects "Puppet" monsters that are originally [[EARTH]] [[Warrior]].

  "[[Gimmick Puppet]]" monsters, and the "Puppet" Spell/Trap Cards that support them, are part of the "Puppet" archetype. However, the only support for "Gimmick Puppet"-themed cards as part of the "Puppet" archetype is "[[CXyz Gimmick Puppet Fanatix Machinix]]", which only supports "Puppet" Trap Cards. In the anime, the anime-exclusive card "[[Puppet Repair]]" could Special Summon "Puppet" monsters from the Graveyard, and was exclusively used on "Gimmick Puppet" monsters.

  == Members ==
  === Chess-themed Puppets ===
  The intended members of the "Puppet" archetype in the card game (i.e. Reiko Kitamori's EARTH Warrior "Puppet" monsters) are each based on a [[wikipedia:Chess|chess]] piece. The archetype's sole support card, "[[Promotion]]", is based on the [[wikipedia:Promotion (chess)|promotion]] mechanic in chess.

  Additionally, the card text of the manga version of "[[Promotion (manga)|Promotion]]" mentions the existence of a "[[Puppet Bishop]]" (based on the [[wikipedia:Bishop (chess)|Bishop]]) and a "[[Puppet Knight]]" (based on the [[wikipedia:Knight (chess)|Knight]]), but they never appeared in the manga and have not been released in the ''OCG''.

  == Trivia ==
  Similarly to "[[Ashened]]", whose first four monsters were made so that the sum of their [[ATK]] is equal to exactly 8000 to allow an [[OTK]], the sum of the ATK of the four chess-themed "Puppet" monsters currently released is equal to exactly 7000. Furthermore, if you summoned "Puppet King" using the effect of "Puppet Queen", all your EARTH Warrior monsters currently on the field (i.e. at least "King") will gain the 1000 ATK points needed to zero your opponent's LP by attacking with all members of the theme once each.
