  "'''Millennium'''" is an [[archetype]] of cards themed around the [[Millennium Items]] and characters that have some connection to them, such as [[Shadi]], [[Shimon Muran]], and [[Solomon Muto]].

  It is a ''[[TCG]]'' archetype that is treated as two separate archetypes in the ''[[OCG]]'': "[[Mireniamu]]" (ミレニアム) and "[[Sennen]]" ({{Ruby|千年|せんねん}}). Since all cards that support the "Mireniamu" archetype also support the "Sennen" archetype, the cards function the same in both regions. This situation is the result of the use of synonyms in Japanese, with "Sennen" simply also localized to "Millennium" in most cases in other languages, for years prior to the introduction of the first support.

  == Design ==
  Despite being derived from the original core mythology of the franchise, support for the archetype only came into being many years after the introduction of the first members, which were not originally intended to synergize. Consequently, the cards vary quite a bit visually and mechanically, however they are united by their incorporation of a quasi-Egyptian aesthetic, especially the [[Eye of Wdjat]], which is the symbol of both the Millennium Items and the [[Illusion]] Type. The "Millennium" monsters' effects to place themselves in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] as [[Continuous Spell Card]]s and [[Special Summon]] themselves from there by paying 2000 LP or revealing "[[Millennium Ankh]]" in the hand is a reference to the [[Millennium Items]] being used to seal monsters within stone tablets or releasing them in the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime and manga.

  Most members are [[retrain]]ed counterparts of monsters that existed since very early on in the franchise's history, in the original manga and early video games.

  == Playing style ==
  ===Millennium Exodia===
  The "Millennium" support introduced in ''The Infinite Forbidden'' revolves around using "[[Millennium Ankh]]" to summon "[[The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate]]".

  Most of the Main Deck monsters share the following effects:
  * If this card is in your hand: You can place it in your Spell & Trap Zone as a face-up Continuous Spell. 
  * Either:
  ** While this card is a Continuous Spell: You can either pay 2000 LP, or reveal 1 "Millennium Ankh" in your hand; Special Summon this card [with another effect on top].
  ** If your opponent activates a card or effect, while this card is a Continuous Spell (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this card [with another effect on top].

  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Card
  ! Description
  |-
  | [[Sengenjin Wakes from a Millennium]]
  | As a Continuous Spell, can be Special Summoned by paying 2000 LP or revealing 1 "Millennium Ankh" from hand, and searches a "Millennium" monster.
  |-
  | [[Golem that Guards the Millennium Treasures]]
  | As a Continuous Spell, can be Special Summoned by paying 2000 LP or revealing 1 "Millennium Ankh" from hand, and searches "[[Wedju Temple]]". On field, prevents the activation of "Millennium Ankh" from being negated.
  |-
  | [[Shield of the Millennium Dynasty]]
  | As a Continuous Spell, can be Special Summoned by paying 2000 LP or revealing 1 "Millennium Ankh" from hand, and searches "[[Millennium Ankh]]".
  |-
  | [[Fiend Reflection of the Millennium]]<br>[[Maiden of the Millennium Moon]]
  | As a Continuous Spell, can be Special Summoned when your opponent activates a card of effect. "Fiend Reflection" lets you gain LP, while "Maiden" prevents your Level 5 or higher Illusion/Spellcaster monsters from being targeted. These are rarely used due to their lackluster effects.
  |-
  | [[Heart of the Blue-Eyes]]
  | Can be discarded to search "[[Millennium Ankh]]". If Millennium Ankh was activated, this card is in your GY, and the opponent summons a monster with either 3000+ ATK or Level 8+, you can send that monster to the GY and Special Summon this card.
  |-
  | [[Wedju Temple]]
  | Field Spell that can place one monster from hand as a Continuous Spell, then place a monster from Deck as a Continuous Spell. Also allows you to place "Millennium" monsters as Continuous Spells if they would be destroyed.
  |-
  | [[Millennium Ankh]]
  | Reveals five "Forbidden One" pieces in your hand/field/Deck to Summon "The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate". However, it prevents Summoning for the rest of the turn, and shuffles face-up Monster cards that are not "Millennium" or level 10 or higher "Exodia" monsters into the Deck.
  |-
  | [[The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate]]
  | Can negate a Spell/Trap activation, and in the End Phase, sets an "[[Exodd]]" or an "[[Obliterate!!!]]" Spell/Trap from the Deck. Also gains ATK equal to your LP during battle, and cannot be destroyed by the opponent's card effects. However, it makes you lose 1000 LP for each of your Standby Phases.
  |}

  On the first turn, "[[Exxod Fires of Rage]]" is typically the best card to set with "The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate". "[[Obliterate!!! Blaze]]", meanwhile, can give "Incarnate" the effect to destroy all Spells/Traps on the field, then gain 10000 ATK and piercing.

  Because the Deck does not use the Normal Summon or the Graveyard (except for "Heart of the Blue-Eyes"), cards like "[[The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode]]" and "[[Dimension Shifter]]" can be run to hinder the opponent.

  Since the Main Deck monsters have no archetypal locks/requirements, it is possible to use "[[Sengenjin Wakes from a Millennium]]", "[[Golem that Guards the Millennium Treasures]]", "[[Wedju Temple]]", and/or "[[Shield of the Millennium Dynasty]]" as a standalone engine, summoning up to 3 bodies for 6000 LP.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * All five "Forbidden One" pieces must be ran to activate "Millennium Ankh", and are bricks in hand (unless all five are drawn together).
  * The archetype's endboard is relatively weak, relying almost exclusively on "The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate" and the Spell/Trap it sets for interaction.
  * "Dimension Shifter" is a key card to the Deck's competitive viability; if "Shifter" is weak into the current meta, the Deck will be worse off.

  === Other cards ===
  Some "Millennium" monsters support other archetypes based off the anime; "[[Millennium-Eyes Illusionist]]" and "[[Millennium-Eyes Restrict]]" are support for the "[[Eyes Restrict]]" archetype, while "[[Millennium Revelation]]" is primarily [[The Winged Dragon of Ra]] support. The rest of the archetype is mostly old Normal Monsters (e.g., "[[Millennium Shield]]" and "[[Sengenjin]]").
