  "'''Millennium'''" is an [[archetype]] of cards themed around the [[Millennium Items]] and characters that have some connection to them, namely [[Shadi]], [[Shimon Muran]], [[Maximillion Pegasus]], [[Solomon Muto]] and [[Yami Yugi]].

  It is a ''[[TCG]]'' archetype that is treated as two separate archetypes in the ''[[OCG]]'': "[[Mireniamu]]" (ミレニアム) and "[[Sennen]]" ({{Ruby|千年|せんねん}}). Since all cards that support the "Mireniamu" archetype also support the "Sennen" archetype, the cards function the same in both regions. This situation is the result of the use of synonyms in Japanese, with "Sennen" simply also localized to "Millennium" in most cases in other languages, for years prior to the introduction of the first support.

  == Design ==
  Despite being derived from the original core mythology of the franchise, support for the archetype only came into being many years after the introduction of the first members, which were not originally intended to synergize. Consequently, the cards vary quite a bit visually and mechanically, however they are united by their incorporation of a quasi-Egyptian aesthetic, especially the [[Eye of Wdjat]], which is the symbol of both the Millennium Items and the [[Illusion]] Type. The "Millennium" monsters' effects to place themselves in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] as [[Continuous Spell Card]]s and [[Special Summon]] themselves from there by either paying 2000 LP or revealing "[[Millennium Ankh]]" in the hand is a reference to the [[Millennium Items]] being used to seal monsters within stone tablets (or release them) in the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime and manga.

  Most members are [[retrain]]ed counterparts of monsters that existed since very early on in the franchise's history, in the original manga and early video games.

  == Playing style ==
  ===Millennium Exodia===
  The "Millennium" support introduced in ''The Infinite Forbidden'' revolves around using "[[Millennium Ankh]]" to Summon "[[The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate]]".

  Most of the Main Deck monsters share the following effects:
  * If this card is in your hand: You can place it in your Spell & Trap Zone as a face-up Continuous Spell. 
  * Either:
  ** While this card is a Continuous Spell: You can either pay 2000 LP, or reveal 1 "Millennium Ankh" in your hand; Special Summon this card [with another effect on top].
  ** If your opponent activates a card or effect, while this card is a Continuous Spell (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this card [with another effect on top].

  {| class="wikitable"

  | Pay LP/Reveal "Ankh"
  | Searches a "Millennium" Monster.
  |-
  | [[Golem that Guards the Millennium Treasures]]
  | Pay LP/Reveal "Ankh"
  | Searches "[[Wedju Temple]]".<br>Prevents the activation of "[[Millennium Ankh]]" from being negated.
  |-
  | [[Shield of the Millennium Dynasty]]
  | Pay LP/Reveal "Ankh"

  |-
  | [[Fiend Reflection of the Millennium]]
  | Opponent activates card/effect
  | Gains LP equal to half a monster's ATK.
  |-
  |[[Maiden of the Millennium Moon]]
  | Opponent activates card/effect
  | Prevents Level 5 or higher Illusion/Spellcaster monsters from being targeted. 
  |}

  Other consistency tools include "[[Heart of the Blue-Eyes]]", which searches "Ankh" and has a GY effect to send a high ATK/Level monster to GY, and "[[Wedju Temple]]", which places a monster from hand to the S/T Zone to place a "Millennium" monster to the S/T Zone.

  "[[Millennium Ankh]]" is critical for the Deck, Summoning "[[The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate]]", but shuffling non-"Millennium"/"Exodia" monster cards to Deck and locking you from Summoning for the rest of the turn. "The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate" itself is a Spell/Trap negate that Sets an "[[Exodd]]"/"[[Obliterate!!!]] Trap from Deck. On the first turn, "[[Exxod Fires of Rage]]" (a field wipe) is typically the best card to Set, though "[[Obliterate!!! Blaze]]" (gives "Exodia Incarnate" a Spell/Trap wipe, 10000 ATK, and piercing) and "[[Obliterate!!!]]" (targeted bounce) are other options.

  === External Cards ===
  Because the Deck does not use the Normal Summon or the Graveyard (except for "Heart of the Blue-Eyes"), cards like "[[The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode]]" and "[[Dimension Shifter]]" can be run to hinder the opponent.

  Since the Main Deck monsters have no archetypal locks/requirements, it is possible to use "[[Sengenjin Wakes from a Millennium]]", "[[Golem that Guards the Millennium Treasures]]", "[[Wedju Temple]]", and "[[Snake-Eyes Doomed Dragon]]" as a standalone engine, Summoning 3 bodies at the cost of 4000 LP and a monster in hand. Since both "Sengenjin" and "Doomed Dragon" are Level 8, this also allows the Xyz Summon of a [[Rank 8 Monster Cards|Rank 8]] monster.

  Though the Deck locks its user out of having non-"Exodia" or "Millennium" monsters on the field during their turn, it is possible to set up Summons on the opponent's turn. For example, "[[Stand Up Centur-Ion!]]" can place "[[Centur-Ion Primera]]" on the field after "Ankh" has been activated, facilitating a Synchro Summon on the opponent's turn.

  === Other cards ===
  Some "Millennium" monsters support other archetypes based off the anime; "[[Millennium-Eyes Illusionist]]" and "[[Millennium-Eyes Restrict]]" are support for the "[[Eyes Restrict]]" archetype, while "[[Millennium Revelation]]" is primarily "[[The Winged Dragon of Ra]]" support. The rest of the archetype is mostly old Normal Monsters (e.g., "[[Millennium Shield]]" and "[[Sengenjin]]").

  ===Weaknesses===
  * All five "Forbidden One" monsters must be present in the hand / Deck / face-up field to activate "[[Millennium Ankh]]", and are otherwise useless (unless all five are drawn together). If one of them is sent to the Graveyard or banished, this can prevent "Millennium Ankh" from being activated.
  ** It is possible for the Graveyard effect of "[[Exxod Fires of Rage]]" to recover any lost "Forbidden One" monsters, but this is usually only possible if the Trap itself is activated on the field first; it is difficult for "Millennium" Decks to send the Trap to the Graveyard through other means.
  * The archetype's [[endboard]] is relatively weak, relying largely on "[[The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate]]" and the Spell/Trap it Sets during the End Phase (typically "Exxod Fires of Rage"), as well as the Graveyard effect of "[[Heart of the Blue-Eyes]]". It usually relies on other cards to supplement its endboard, such as [[floodgate]] cards, [[hand trap]]s, and "[[Silhouhatte Rabbit]]'s" effect to Set a Continuous Trap (that can Summon itself as a monster).
  ** Therefore, cards such as "[[Kaiju]]" monsters, "[[Santa Claws]]", "[[Volcanic Queen]]", and "[[Ultimate Slayer]]" can simultaneously eliminate this Deck's Fusion Monster while preventing "Exxod Fires of Rage" from being activated.
  ** "[[Ghost Reaper & Winter Cherries]]" is also particularly dangerous, as it can pre-emptively banish all copies of "The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate" in the Extra Deck, thus disabling most of the interruption the Deck can use.
  * "[[Millennium Ankh]]" is critical to resolve, so negating or preventing access to it is a good way to counter the Deck.
  ** Floodgates like "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]", "[[Spell Canceller]]", "[[Deck Lockdown]]", and "[[Mistaken Arrest]]" can prevent the use or search of "Ankh", making them good tools when going first against this Deck. "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" can prevent repeated searches going first or second, but it is sometimes possible to get "Ankh" in hand with only 1 search.
  ** "[[Dominus Impulse]]" is a particularly effective [[hand trap]], as it can negate the effect of "Ankh" directly. 
  ** A well-timed "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" can stop a search of "Ankh".
  ** It is possible to use card effects that negate the activation of "Millennium Ankh"; however, the effect of "[[Golem that Guards the Millennium Treasures]]" can thwart this. A better option would be to use effects that negate the '''effect''' of "Millennium Ankh", such as the aforementioned "Dominus Impulse".
  * Since this Deck relies on placing "Millennium" Monster Cards in the Spell & Trap Zone, then activating their effects to Special Summon themselves, "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]" can be effective against them. It also works against "Wedju Temple".
  * Due to most of the "Millennium" monsters have an effect that require the user to pay their [[Life Point costs]], or losing the LP as a [[maintenance cost]] in the case of "The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate", player's LP will be quickly reduced in the prolonged game stage, especially if they doesn't have "Millennium Ankh" in their hand, thus leaving them vulnerable from final damage push by the opponent.
  ** Because of this, it is possible to defeat "Millennium" players by using various [[stall]] monsters with an effect that can stop the player from attacking, such as "[[Battle Fader]]" or "[[Swift Scarecrow]]", in order for them to be weakened enough by "Exodia's" maintenance cost that they will be forced to removing it or risk losing from self-inflicted damage.
