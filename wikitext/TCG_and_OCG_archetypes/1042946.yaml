  "'''Millennium'''" (ミレニアムーン, ''Mireniamūn'') is an [[archetype]] of cards themed around the [[Millenium Items]] and their wielders, particularly [[Shadi]], [[Maximillion Pegasus]], and [[Shimon Muran]]. It is interrelated with, but separate from, the "[[Sennen]]" archetype, however the distinction between the two is largely negligible for practical purposes, as cards that support one always support the other as well; this situation resulting from the use of synonyms in Japanese (a similar case exist for the "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" and "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" archetypes).

  == Design ==
  Despite being derived from the original core mythology of the franchise, support for the archetype only came into being many years after the introduction of the first members, which were not originally intended to synergize. Consequently, the cards vary quite a bit visually and mechanically, however they are united by their incorporation of a quasi-Egyptian aesthetic, especially the [[Eye of Wdjat]], which is the symbol of both the Millennium Items and the [[Illusion]]-Type.

  Most members are retrained counterparts of monsters that existed very early on in the franchise's history, in the original manga and early video games.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Millennium" support (introduced in ''Infinite Forbidden'') is intended to allow the cards to function as part of an "[[Exodia]]"/"[[Forbidden One]]" deck ecosystem. Some older members are instead intended to be part of a "[[Relinquished]]"-themed deck.
