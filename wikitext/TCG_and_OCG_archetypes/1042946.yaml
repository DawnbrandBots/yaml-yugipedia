  "'''Millennium'''" is an [[archetype]] of cards themed around the [[Millennium Items]] and characters that have some connection to them, such as [[Shadi]], [[Shimon Muran]], and [[Solomon Muto]].

  It is a ''[[TCG]]'' archetype that is treated as two separate archetypes in the ''[[OCG]]'': "[[Millennium (mireniamu)|Mireniamu]]" (ミレニアム) and "[[Millennium (sennen)|Sennen]]" ({{Ruby|千年|せんねん}}). Since all cards that support the "Mireniamu" archetype also support the "Sennen" archetype, the cards function the same in both regions. This situation is the result of the use of synonyms in Japanese, with "Sennen" simply also localized to "Millennium" in most cases in other languages, for years prior to the introduction of the first support.

  == Design ==
  Despite being derived from the original core mythology of the franchise, support for the archetype only came into being many years after the introduction of the first members, which were not originally intended to synergize. Consequently, the cards vary quite a bit visually and mechanically, however they are united by their incorporation of a quasi-Egyptian aesthetic, especially the [[Eye of Wdjat]], which is the symbol of both the Millennium Items and the [[Illusion]] Type.

  Most members are [[retrain]]ed counterparts of monsters that existed since very early on in the franchise's history, in the original manga and early video games.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Millennium" support (introduced in ''The Infinite Forbidden'') is intended to allow the cards to function as part of an "[[Exodia]]"/"[[Forbidden One]]" Deck. Some older members are instead intended to be part of a "[[Relinquished]]" Deck.
