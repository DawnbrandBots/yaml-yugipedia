  '''Vanquish Soul''' ({{Ruby|ＶＳ|ヴァンキッシュ・ソウル}} ''Vankisshu Souru'') is an [[Archetype|archetype]] of [[FIRE]], [[DARK]], and [[EARTH]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Wild Survivors]]''/''[[Wild Survivors]]''.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#No. 07: Vanquish Soul}}

  ==Etymology==
  The name of the theme is likely in reference to how a fighting game introduces their opponents to the player as especially seen through the "VS" abbreviation on the cards in Japanese meant to refer to the word "versus".
   
  ==Design==
  The "Vanquish Soul" archetype shares many general aesthetics with those found in various popular fighting game franchises; such as ''[[wikipedia:Guilty Gear|Guilty Gear]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:BlazBlue|BlazBlue]]''. The archetype's monsters especially have designs that match the common character tropes rosters of this genre of games from monsters like "[[Vanquish Soul Razen]]" sharing common design elements with that of the standard Fighting Game Protagonist character to "[[Vanquish Soul Heavy Borger]]" being similar to the design of large grappler characters and the archetype's main boss monster, "[[Vanquish Soul Caesar Valius]]", taking ideas from the final boss of a fighting game. "[[Vanquish Soul Caesar Valius]]" heavily resembles Yuuki Terumi (specifically Susanoo), the main antagonist of ''[[wikipedia:BlazBlue|BlazBlue]]''.
   
  This influence can also be seen in the way the effects are formatted. The way many members of the archetype Special Summon themselves by returning other members of the archetype to the hand can be seen as representing tagging out to an assist character (similar to the likes of ''[[wikipedia:Marvel vs. Capcom|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' or ''[[wikipedia:Dead or Alive (franchise)|Dead or Alive]]''). The way each member has different effects depending on the quantity of Attributes revealed in the hand can be seen as representing different button inputs.

  Additionally, their Spell/Trap Cards such as "[[Vanquish Soul Dust Devil]]" and "[[Vanquish Soul Calamity Caesar]]" can be seen as either special moves or "Super Moves/Hyper Combos" of their featured monsters, where the user performs an especially powerful attack or technique to provide immense utility and power in a given situation, as well as put the opponent in an easy position to further the player's onslaught.

  ==Playing style==
  "Vanquish Soul" revolves around the shared ability to, as a [[Quick Effect]], [[reveal]] monsters from the hand in order to activate a variety of effects depending on the revealed monster's Attribute. The deck generally plays a [[control]]/midrange strategy, aiming to generate card advantage on both players' turns to outgrind the opponent.

  All "Vanquish Soul" monsters are [[EARTH]], [[FIRE]], or [[DARK]]. Each monster has an effect related to summoning; either the monster searches on summon ("[[Vanquish Soul Razen|Razen]]" and "[[Vanquish Soul Dr. Mad Love|Dr. Mad Love]]" specifically), or the monster can conditionally Special Summon itself from the hand, for some as a Quick Effect, possibly even on [[Turn 0]]. Because the former cannot self-Summon, they are the Deck's main [[Normal Summon]]s.

  Each monster also has a Quick Effect activated by revealing EARTH, FIRE, and/or DARK monster(s) in the hand, with a choice between two options: a typically weaker effect requiring revealing 1 monster with the same Attribute as the "Vanquish Soul" itself, and a typically stronger effect requiring revealing multiple monsters of certain Attribute combinations.

  Because of these varied Quick Effects, the Deck can easily play on both players turns, producing varied disruptions or card advantage generation, as long as the player has the requisite monster Attributes in the hand.

  Between their summon-related and reveal-based effects, "[[Vanquish Soul Razen|Razen]]", "[[Vanquish Soul Dr. Mad Love|Dr. Mad Love]]", "[[Vanquish Soul Jiaolong|Jiaolong]]", "[[Vanquish Soul Heavy Borger|Heavy Borger]]", and "[[Vanquish Soul Holy Sue|Holy Sue]]" are the Deck's main advantage generators; most of them also have removal effects.

  Thematically, "[[Vanquish Soul Heavy Borger|Heavy Borger]]" and "[[Vanquish Soul Caesar Valius|Caesar Valius]]" are the Deck's main boss monsters, able to Special Summon themselves by returning a "Vanquish Soul" that isn't the same Type as them to the hand, and having advantage generating or removal effects.

  Extra Deck "Vanquish Soul" monsters primarily act as support rather than being mainstay boss monsters; "[[Rock of the Vanquisher]]" is a de facto Field Spell that supports the Deck with [[GY]] recycling or effect to Summon "Vanquish Soul" monsters from hand (useful for triggering the "Normal Summoners" on the opponent's turn), while "[[Vanquish Soul Rocks]]" is a situational summon that provides Spell Speed 1 removal. Both also provide a degree of battle protection.

  The theme's various searchable [[Spell Card]]s and [[Trap Card]]s offer extra consistency ("[[Stake your Soul!]]", "[[Vanquish Soul, Start!]]"), some recovery ("[[Vanquish Soul - Continue?|Continue?]]"), and bonus disruptions ("[[Vanquish Soul Dust Devil|Dust Devil]]", "[[Vanquish Soul Snow Devil|Snow Devil]]", "[[Vanquish Soul Trinity Burst|Trinity Burst]]", "[[Vanquish Soul Calamity Caesar|Calamity Caesar]]") for the opponent to face.

  Due to the theme's main playstyle of revealing monsters of various attributes to activate their effects, the theme generally requires a critical mass of EARTH, FIRE, and DARK monsters in the deck; hand traps of these Attributes can provide a flexible way to fill this quota, such as "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]", "[[Ghost Belle & Haunted Mansion]]" and "[[Maxx "C"]]" (in the OCG), and "[[D.D. Crow]]". 

  A "[[K9]]" engine fits well into a "Vanquish Soul" deck. The various EARTH and DARK monsters within the "K9" archetype can be revealed to activate "Vanquish Soul" card effects, while Level 5 "Vanquish Soul" monsters such as "[[Vanquish Soul Jiaolong|Jiaolong]]" and "[[Vanquish Soul Holy Sue|Holy Sue]]" can facilitate the creation of Rank 5 monsters that "K9" revolves around.

  ==Weaknesses==
  * Because "Vanquish Soul" Deck relies heavily on making several searches within a turn, anti-search cards such as "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" and "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" can hinders the Deck's consistency.
  * Since all "Vanquish Soul" monsters require the player to reveal a card in their hand to use the effect, "[[Respect Play]]" and "[[Ceremonial Bell]]" can shut down any of these effects, as player would be forced to reveal their entire hand and unable to fulfil the activation condition.
