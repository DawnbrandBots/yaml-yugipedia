  "'''Hazy'''", known as "'''Haze'''" (ヘイズ ''Heizu'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of cards introduced in the ''[[Cosmo Blazer]]'' booster pack that includes the "[[Hazy Flame]]" archetype. The "Hazy" monsters, mainly depend on one Tribute and are all Level 6. Spell and Trap Cards that support the archetype share the common effect of allowing the user to Normal Summon "Hazy Flame" monsters for 1 less Tribute. The Xyz Monster introduced in this archetype, "[[Hazy Flame Basiltrice]]", is the first Xyz in the TCG that is able to be Xyz Summoned with up to 5 monsters at once.
