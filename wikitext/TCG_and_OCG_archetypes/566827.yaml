  "'''Prank-Kids'''" (プランキッズ ''Purankizzu'') is an [[archetype]] that debuted in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Hidden Summoners]]''.

  == Design ==
  To fit with the pun of the archetype's name, the low-level "Prank-Kids" are depicted as prankster familiars of various elements.

  Based on a series of events depicted in "Prank-Kids" cards, the Main Deck "Prank-Kids" familiars have pulled a "prank" on "[[Prank-Kids Battle Butler|Battle Butler]]", a mild-mannered robot who lives peacefully with its pet [[wikipedia:American bulldog|American bulldog]]. A series of events resulted in "Battle Butler's" house being destroyed (shown in "[[Prank-Kids Pranks]]"). "Battle Butler" is later shown being possessed by "Prank-Kids" familiars after the events of "[[Prank-Kids Pandemonium]]". The "Prank-Kids" Link monsters appeared as various animals empowered by the main deck familiars. In their artworks, "Battle Butler's" pet dog was subjected to various pranks as well.

  == Playing style ==
  The main strategy of this archetype is to swarm the field to summon their [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]] and [[Link Monster]]s. The deck's compact size allows it access to a be run along side a number of other archetypes and [[hand trap]]s, which allowed the deck to become a very powerful deck with large tournament success until [[Prank-Kids Meow-Meow-Mu]] and [[Predaplant Verte Anaconda]] were both banned in 2022.
