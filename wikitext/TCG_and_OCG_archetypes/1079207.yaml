  "'''Argostars'''" ({{Ruby|ＡＲＧ☆Ｓ|アルゴスターズ}} ''Arugosutāzu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]] 4 [[Warrior]] monsters (many of them being [[Trap Monster]]s) introduced in ''[[Supreme Darkness]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  "Argostars" is a portmanteau of "[[wikipedia:Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]]" (the name of a Greek city) and "stars". The name "Argos" is said to originate from the Greek word ''argós'' (αργός), meaning "white" or "shining". The word "star" can refer to both the five-pointed symbol (☆) and a famous or exceptionally talented performer in the world of entertainment or sports.

  The [[Effect Monster]] "[[Argostars - Glorious Adra]]" is named after [[wikipedia:Adrastus|Adrastus]], a king of Argos and the leader of the [[wikipedia:Seven against Thebes|Seven against Thebes]]. The [[Xyz Monster]] "[[Argostars - Courageous Arion]]" is named after [[wikipedia:Arion (horse)|his horse]], while the rest are named after the other members of the group. The archetype's sports theme is likely a reference to the [[wikipedia:Nemean Games|Nemean Games]], an athletic festival similar to the [[wikipedia:Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] that was established by the Seven against Thebes and first won by Arion.

  The titles of the Trap Monsters are the names of various Japanese WW2 [[wikipedia:Fighter aircraft|fighter aircraft]], while the Main Deck monsters are named after their engines. In particular, the "Glorious" moniker of "Adra" may be an allusion to the [[wikipedia:Nakajima Sakae|Nakajima ''Sakae'']] (written as 「栄」, a kanji meaning "glory" also used to construct the word "laurel" in Japanese, 「栄冠」, which is the title of "Adra" in the ''OCG''), a [[wikipedia:Radial engine|radial engine]] used to power a number of Japanese combat aircraft before and during WWII. Radial engines are also referred to as "star engines" due to their appearance.

  === Members ===
  The members that are originally Main Deck Monster Cards are [[EARTH]], the Xyz Monster is [[DARK]], and the Trap Monsters are [[LIGHT]].
