  "'''Argostars'''" ({{Ruby|ＡＲＧ☆Ｓ|アルゴスターズ}} ''Arugosutāzu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]] 4 [[Warrior]] monsters (many of them being [[Trap Monster]]s) introduced in ''[[Supreme Darkness]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  "Argostars" is a portmanteau of "[[wikipedia:Argos, Peloponnese|Argos]]" (the name of a Greek city) and "stars". The name "Argos" is said to originate from the Greek word ''argós'' (αργός), meaning "white" or "shining". The word "star" can refer to both the five-pointed symbol (☆) and a famous or exceptionally talented performer in the world of entertainment or sports.

  The [[Effect Monster]] "[[Argostars - Glorious Adra]]" is named after [[wikipedia:Adrastus|Adrastus]], a king of Argos and the leader of the [[wikipedia:Seven against Thebes|Seven against Thebes]]. The [[Xyz Monster]] "[[Argostars - Adventurous Arion]]" is named after [[wikipedia:Arion (horse)|his horse]], while the rest are named after the other members of the group. The archetype's sports theme is likely a reference to the [[wikipedia:Nemean Games|Nemean Games]], an athletic festival similar to the [[wikipedia:Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] that was established by the Seven against Thebes and first won by Arion.

  The titles of the Trap Monsters are the names of various Japanese WW2 [[wikipedia:Fighter aircraft|fighter aircraft]], while the Main Deck monsters are named after their engines. In particular, the "Glorious" moniker of "Adra" may be an allusion to the [[wikipedia:Nakajima Sakae|Nakajima ''Sakae'']] (written as 「栄」, a kanji meaning "glory" also used to construct the word "laurel" in Japanese, 「栄冠」, which is the title of "Adra" in the ''OCG''), a [[wikipedia:Radial engine|radial engine]] used to power a number of Japanese combat aircraft before and during WWII. Radial engines are also referred to as "star engines" due to their appearance.

  === Members ===
  The members that are originally Main Deck Monster Cards are [[EARTH]], the Xyz Monster is [[DARK]], and the Trap Monsters are [[LIGHT]].

  == Playing style ==
  "Argostars" is an archetype based around [[Continuous Trap]]s, which can Summon themselves and put themselves back into the Spell and Trap Zone. Also, each "Argostars" Main Deck monster has an effect to banish itself, while many of their Spells/Traps rely on having a banished "Argostars" monster.

  Each of their Continuous Traps shares the following effects:
  * While face-up in the Spell and Trap Zone, they have an unique effect that buffs [[Warrior]] monsters.
  * An effect to Special Summon itself as an Effect Monster, with a unique bonus after being Summoned. Each of the Traps has a different activation requirement.
  * While a monster, they have a Quick Effect to place themselves back into the Spell and Trap Zone.

  "[[Argostars - Home Stadium|Home Stadium]]" deals 500 damage whenever any Continuous Trap Summons itself. If there is a [[banish]]ed "Argostar" monster, it can also [[negate]] an opposing card if any Continuous Trap activates its monster effect (but this effect can only be activated the [[Chain]] after the Trap was activated). Both of those effects work with ''any'' Continuous Trap, not just in-archetype ones. Finally, it can recycle an "Argostars" card each turn from GY or banishment.

  Their Main Deck and Extra Deck monsters all help set up the Continuous Traps, while their Spells either search or recur the archetype's cards.
  * "[[Argostars - Fierce Parthe|Fierce Parthe]]" can Special Summon itself by bouncing an in-archetype Trap, and banish itself to Set an in-archetype Continuous Trap from hand that can be activated that turn. 
  * "[[Argostars - Glorious Adra|Glorious Adra]]" prevents the opponent from responding to any Continuous Trap effects, and banishes itself to set 2 in-archetype Continuous Traps.
  * "[[Argostars - Adventurous Arion|Adventurous Arion]]" is a generic Rank 4 that searches an "Argostars" Spell, then in the opponent's Standby, detaches 2 materials to Set up to 3 in-archetype Continuous Traps, and can be Summoned with 1 "Argostars" monster. 
  * "[[Argostars - Giantslaying|Giantslaying]]" is a Quick-Play that searches an "Argostars" monster, then allows a Normal Summon if there is a face-up "Argostars" Continuous Trap anywhere on the field.

  The theme synergizes with various forms of Trap Monster support, such as "[[Silhouhatte Rabbit]]" and the [[Temple of the Kings (series)|Tombkeeper]] series. Rank 4 strategies, such as "[[Ryzeal]]", can also be used to Summon "[[Argostars - Adventurous Arion|Adventurous Arion]]".
