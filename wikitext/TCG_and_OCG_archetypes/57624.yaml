  "'''Jurrac'''" (ジュラック ''Jurakku'') is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Dinosaur]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] released as [[Duel Terminal]] Promos in ''[[Duel Terminal - Demon Roar God Revival!!]]'' and ''[[Hidden Arsenal 2]]''.

  == Duel Terminal Storyline ==
  {{Main|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines}}
  The invasion of the "[[Worms]]" has barely affected the "Jurracs". However, after having watched battles desolate the ground below, "[[Fabled Valkyrus]]" descends to the nearby realm of the "Jurracs". When the wicked gods suddenly struck, the "Jurracs" fought back with the flames that covered their bodies.
  The "Jurracs", victims of the most intense attacks of the [[Fabled]]'s conquest scheme, transformed their bodies into meteors, and completely razed the land where the "Fabled" dwelt. From the ashes, a new fire was born, the "[[Neo Flamvell]]".
  The wishes of those who lost their bodies by dropping the "[[Jurrac Meteor|Meteor]]" awoke the [[Ancient Flamvell Deity|God of the Ancient Flames]]. The tribe of Fire becomes one with the ancient deity, sweeping away the "Fabled" that remained in their realm.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  Visually, most "Jurrac" monsters are brightly colored, usually with bright red and yellow extremities and blue bodies, resembling the various colors of flame.

  === Etymology ===
  "Jurrac" is derived from the word, "'''Jura'''ssi'''c'''". Each "Jurrac" monster is based on and named after a genus of dinosaur with the exceptions of "Jurrac Dino", which resembles a ''[[wikipedia:Ceratosaurus|Ceratosaurus]]'' but is named after ''[[wikipedia:Deinonychus|Deinonychus]]'', "Jurrac Meteor", which is named after the meteor that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, and "Jurrac Ptera", which is named after ''[[wikipedia:Pteranodon|Pteranodon]]'', a flying reptile called a pterosaur that isn't actually a dinosaur.

  == Playing style ==
  Prior to ''[[Terminal World 2]]'', "Jurrac" as an archetype almost entirely focused around battle; like most archetypes stemming from the [[Duel Terminal]] machines, it was outdated on release. The modernized cards in ''Terminal World 2'' focus on Summoning "[[Jurrac Meteor]]" and using its board wipe effect multiple times on the opponent's turn. Because there aren't enough modern "Jurrac" cards to fill a Deck, it is typically complemented with [[Dinosaur]] support like "[[Miscellaneousaurus]]" and/or the "[[Fire King]]" archetype (which can destroy "Jurrac Megalo" from hand, field, or Deck).

  If destroyed, "[[Jurrac Megalo]]" can send a "Jurrac" from Extra Deck to GY - typically "[[Jurrac Astero]]", which has a GY Quick Effect to Summon "[[Jurrac Meteor]]". "Jurrac Meteor" destroys all monsters on the field. Notably, both "Astero" and "Meteor" are not once per turn, thus enabling multiple board wipes a turn. "[[Jurrac Stego]]" can destroy a card on your field, dump a Dinosaur from GY, then Special Summon "Jurrac" monsters from GY, although it locks the player into Dinosaurs.

  A more dedicated "Jurrac" Deck can use the archetype's Field Spell, "[[Jurrac Volcano]]", which can destroy a Dinosaur to search a "Jurrac" monster, protects "Jurracs" from destruction, and has another effect to Summon "Jurrac Meteor". They can also use "Astero's" on-field effects to search a "Jurrac" Spell/Trap and negate Summons. "[[Jurrac Impact]]" is the main search target, a Trap which Tributes a high ATK Dinosaur as cost to destroy all cards on field.

  === Sample combos ===
  "[[Jurrac Stego]]" can start many combos on its own. One of them aims to setup as many board wipes as possible, as well as creating followup or more disruption. The following combo can:
  # Negate up to 2 Special Summons per turn, thanks to the 2 copies of "[[Jurrac Astero]]" on the field.
  # Create 4 ways to Summon "[[Jurrac Meteor]]" during the opponent's turn, allowing for 3 board wipes even if one of these methods is interrupted.
  # Have "[[Jurrac Impact]]" as an additional board wipe while also setting up the ways to Summon "Meteor".
  # Have "[[Jurrac Volcano]]" to protect the player's monsters from "Jurrac Meteor" once.
  # Search "[[Ultimate Conductor Tyranno]]" as followup in hand, or additional disruption on field.

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Jurrac Stego]]"
  | end     = 2 "[[Jurrac Astero]]", "[[Jurrac Volcano]]" and "[[Jurrac Impact]]" on field + third "Jurrac Astero" in GY + "[[Ultimate Conductor Tyranno]]" in hand (or field)
  | steps   = 
  # [[Normal Summon]] "[[Jurrac Stego]]".
  # Activate "Stego", destroying itself and sending "[[Miscellaneousaurus]]" from the Deck to the GY to [[Special Summon]] 2 copies of "[[Jurrac Megalo]]" and 2 copies of "[[Jurrac Aeolo]]" from Deck.
  # Activate "Aeolo", Tributing itself to Summon "Stego" from the GY.
  # [[Synchro Summon]] "[[Jurrac Velphito]]" by using "Megalo" and "Stego".
  # Synchro Summon "[[Horned Brute Carnovorus]]" by using "Megalo" and "Velphito".
  # Activate the second "Aeolo", Tributing itself to Summon "Stego" from the GY.
  # Synchro Summon "[[Jurrac Astero]]" by using "Carnovorus" and "Stego".
  # Activate "Astero" to Set "[[Jurrac Volcano]]" from Deck.
  # Activate "Miscellaneousaurus", banishing itself and "Velphito" to Summon "[[Babycerasaurus]]" from Deck.
  # Activate "Jurrac Volcano" to destroy "Babycerasaurus" and Summon a third "Jurrac Megalo" from Deck.
  # Activate "Babycerasaurus" to Summon "[[Souleating Oviraptor]]" from Deck.
  # Activate "Oviraptor" to add "[[Ultimate Conductor Tyranno]]" to the hand.
  # Activate "Oviraptor" to destroy "Megalo" and Summon "Carnovorus" from the GY.
  # Activare "Megalo" to send another "Jurrac Astero" from the Extra Deck to the GY.
  # Synchro Summon the last "Jurrac Astero" by using "Carnovorus" and "Oviraptor".
  # Activate "Astero" to Set "[[Jurrac Impact]]" from Deck.
  # Optionally Summon "[[Ultimate Conductor Tyranno]]" by banishing any 2 "Jurrac" monsters from the GY.

  ===Weaknesses===
  *The archetype relies heavily on destruction effects in order to disrupt the opponent. Therefore, cards with floating effects or destruction protection are harder to deal with.
  *"[[Sales Ban]]" and "[[The Black Goat Laughs]]" can block the effect of "Jurrac Meteor", even if multiple copies are Summoned, removing much of the archetype's interaction.
