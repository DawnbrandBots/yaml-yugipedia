  "'''Galaxy'''" (ギャラクシー ''Gyarakushī'') is an [[archetype]] of cards used by [[Kite Tenjo]], [[Nelson Andrews]], and [[Mizar]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime as well as [[Eviluder]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' manga in addition to an [[Kite Tenjo (ARC-V)|alternate universe Kite Tenjo]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. The [[Monster Card|monsters]] in this archetype tend to be quite powerful, while the [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Cards]] usually function as [[support]] or have synergy with the related "[[Photon]]" or "[[Tachyon]]" archetypes. The archetype is geared towards quickly Summoning the "[[Galaxy-Eyes]]" Xyz Monsters as fast as possible.

  == Playing style ==
  A "Galaxy" Deck focuses on Summoning several Level 8 monsters for Xyz Summons. By using "[[Accellight]]" to [[Special Summon]] a "[[Galaxy Wizard]]", its Level can be changed to 8, and using "[[Galaxy Expedition]]" to bring out "[[Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon]]", a [[Rank 8 Monster Cards|Rank 8]] [[Xyz Monster]] can be instantly Summoned. "[[Galaxy Zero]]" can be used to revive a Level 8 monster, Normal Summon "[[Galaxy Knight]]", and revive "GEPD" to overlay for "[[Neo Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon]]", "[[Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]", or "[[Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon]]".
  "Galaxy Wizard" can search out most of the important Spells and monsters in the Deck, but using its effect leaves your field exposed. Because of this, it's recommended to use "[[Photon Thrasher]]" to maintain field presence, with the added bonus that "Thrasher" can be used with "Wizard" for Rank 4 Xyz Monsters like "[[Starliege Paladynamo]]" and "[[Constellar Omega]]". Furthermore, Special Summoning "Thrasher" lets you Normal Summon "Galaxy Knight" without Tribute in the same turn.
  The inclusion of "[[Galaxy Soldier]]" combined with "[[Galaxy Expedition]]" also gives a player the chance to incorporate some capable Rank 5 monsters, such as "[[Constellar Pleiades]]". An excellent combo is to discard a "Galaxy-Eyes" with "Soldier" to Special Summon the latter, then use "Soldier's" searching effect to add a "Galaxy Knight" to the hand. "Galaxy Knight" can then be Normal Summon and revive the "Galaxy-Eyes" in the Graveyard, to bring out a Rank 8 monster. The effect of "Soldier" is sometimes used with other LIGHT archetypes, like "[[Kozmo]]" or "[[Artifact]]", to speed up [[Xyz Summon]]ing powerful [[Rank]] 5 Monsters like "Constellar Pleiades", "[[Cyber Dragon Nova]]" into "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]".  While "Soldier" can be used on its own, a single "Wizard" can be used to search for "Galaxy Expedition" to [[Special Summon]] "Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon" or another "Soldier", depending on whether a Rank 5 Xyz Summon or raw power is needed.

  === Weaknesses ===
  Because this Deck is focused on multiple large Special Summons for high damage, your opponent may slow you down with "[[Torrential Tribute]]" or "[[Solemn Warning]]". It's a good idea to run "[[Starlight Road]]" and extra Spell/Trap removal.
  This Deck is also heavily dependent on the Graveyard, so "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]" will prevent many of the Xyz combos.
  Because the Deck will most likely be running many high-Level monsters, [[dead draw]]s can be very frequent if your field or hand is not set up at the time to allow for their Summoning - this can happen quite easily if your field was cleared from an attack or card effect and you no longer have the resources to pull off the combos you rely on.
