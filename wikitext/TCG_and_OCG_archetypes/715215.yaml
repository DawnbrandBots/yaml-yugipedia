  "'''Gunkan'''" ({{Ruby|軍|ぐん}}{{Ruby|貫|かん}} ''Gunkan'', lit. "Suship") is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Aqua]] monsters introduced in ''[[Dawn of Majesty]]''.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines#No. 07: Gunkan|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#The Secret of the Popular Menu: Word of Mouth}}

  ==Design==
  "Gunkan" cards are inspired by the ''gunkan maki'' (lit. "warship roll") style of sushi, a type of sushi made by wrapping a strip of nori around a rice ball with a topping.

  "[[Gunkan Suship Shari]]" represents the base of the roll. The Main Deck [[Effect Monster]]s each represent a topping. The [[Xyz Monster]]s are warships that represent stacking the topping on top of the rice.

  The [[DEF]] of the "Gunkan" monsters corresponds to their price: these prices are listed on "[[Gunkan Suship Daily Special]]", and "[[Gunkan Sushipyard Seaside Supper Spot]]" can force an opponent to pay this price (in [[LP]]) if they spoil a completed sushi roll (i.e. their card sends a Special Summoned "Gunkan" monster to the Graveyard). The Xyz Monsters have [[ATK]] and DEF equal to the total ATK and DEF of "Gunkan Suship Shari" and their corresponding Main Deck Effect Monster—since "Gunkan Suship Shari" has 0 DEF, they always have the same DEF as their corresponding Main Deck Effect Monster.
  ===Etymology===
  The archetype's Japanese name derives from {{Ruby|軍|ぐん}}{{Ruby|艦|かん}} ("warship"), but with the second kanji swapped out for {{Ruby|貫|かん}}, the [[wikipedia:Japanese counter word|counter kanji]] for sushi, which has the same reading.

  The archetype's English name is just the transliteration of the Japanese name. However, all "Gunkan" cards include "Gunkan Suship" in their full names, including both the transliteration of the Japanese name and a localization of it. "Suship" is a portmanteau of "sushi" and "ship", reflecting the pun formed by {{Ruby|軍|ぐん}}{{Ruby|艦|かん}}.

  ==Playing style==
  The archetype revolves around getting as many of their [[Xyz Monster]]s on the [[field]] as quickly as possible. The first time each one of them is Summoned using "[[Gunkan Suship Shari]]" as a [[material]], they will [[draw a card]], recuperating card advantage.

  "Gunkan Suship Shari" is a [[Normal Monster]], and thus benefits from the many support cards that can make searching and Summoning it easier, such as "[[Rescue Rabbit]]" and "[[Unexpected Dai]]". "Shari" also has a respectable 2000 [[ATK]] as a [[Level]] 4, which means it can be used to complement "[[Gunkan Suship Ikura-class Dreadnought]]" in a beatdown-centric playstyle. The lack of restrictions on the archetype also means that it can be used as fuel for [[Xyz Summon]]s from the plethora of [[Rank]] 4 Xyz toolbox. The synchronization between "Gunkan Suship Ikura" and "[[Gunkan Sushipyard Seaside Supper Spot]]" is important in the Deck, as "Kaisen" is able stack "Shari" from the Deck, which is then [[Special Summon]]ed with "Ikura". Due to this importance, cards that search [[Field Spell]]s such as "[[Terraforming]]" and "[[Metaverse]]" are highly recommended. "[[Gunkan Suship Daily Special]]" can be used to search either monster component, by revealing 3 "Shari" when only "Ikura" is available, and revealing "Shari" from the [[hand]] to specifically add "Ikura" when the latter is unavailable. "Roll Specials" can also be used as a recovery card, by shuffling used up "Gunkan" monsters from the [[GY]] while also granting a free card.

  It is very important for the Deck's playing style that "Shari" remains in circulation to further the Deck's plays, so the effects that can detach it from the "Gunkan" Xyz Monsters after their on-Summon effects have been used can be useful, such as "[[Time Thief Winder]]" or the searchable [[Counter Trap Card]] "[[Xyz Block]]".
