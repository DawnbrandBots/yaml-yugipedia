  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  "Evil Eye" refers to the [[wikipedia:Evil eye|evil eye]], a supernatural belief that a malevolent gaze can curse someone. This concept is present across multiple religions and cultures.
  The members of the archetype are named after various creatures and beings associated with cursed gazes or eyes.
  "[[Evil Eye Domain - Pareidolia]]" is named after [[wikipedia:Pareidolia|pareidolia]], the tendency to impose a meaningful interpretation onto a visual stimulus. "[[Evil Eye of Gorgoneio]]" and "[[Evil Eye of Selene]]" are named after the amulet [[wikipedia:Gorgoneion|Gorgoneion]] and the goddess [[wikipedia:Selene|Selene]], respectively.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Evil Eye" archetype revolves around the [[Equip Spell]] "[[Evil Eye of Selene]]". The human-formed "Evil Eye" monsters all gain disruptive [[Quick Effect]]s if they are equipped with "Evil Eye of Selene", and all "Evil Eye" Spell/Traps (outside of Equip Spells) gain additional beneficial effects if "Evil Eye of Selene" is in the player's S/T Zone.
  "Evil Eye of Selene" is a powerful Equip Spell that can only be equipped to an "Evil Eye" monster, and provides them with destruction protection, targeting protection, and ATK boosts (with LP payment costs).
  The human-formed "Evil Eye" monsters each gain access to a disruptive [[Quick Effect]] if they are equipped with "Evil Eye of Selene", further boosting their combat efficacy. However, during the next [[Standby Phase]] after using their Quick Effect, each of them will [[Mandatory effect|mandatorily]] trigger a second effect that is usually a negative for the player.

  | {{Link map|Top-Center, Bottom-Center}}

  |}
  Aside from these "Evil Eye of Selene"-related effects, each of them also has an individual effect. "[[Serziel, Watcher of the Evil Eye|Serziel]]" searches on Normal Summon, "[[Medusa, Watcher of the Evil Eye|Medusa]]" recovers from GY on Normal Summon, while "[[Zerrziel, Ruler of the Evil Eyed|Zerrziel]]" and "[[Gorgon, Empress of the Evil Eyed|Gorgon]]" have additional battle-boosting effects. "Serziel" is the most important monster among them: it can search any "Evil Eye" card, including "Evil Eye of Selene", when Normal Summoned, making it the central searcher for the Deck and the Deck's primary Normal Summon and board presence.
  The other "Evil Eye" monsters, "[[Basilius, Familiar of the Evil Eye|Basilius]]" and "[[Catoblepas, Familiar of the Evil Eye|Catoblepas]]" provide additional situational utility, such as extension, [[mill]]ing, and protection.
  Outside of "Evil Eye of Selene", there are three other "Evil Eye" Spell/Traps of note: "[[Evil Eye Domain - Pareidolia]]" is the Deck's [[Field Spell]], and is an "Evil Eye" monster searcher. "[[Evil Eye of Gorgoneio]]" is a weaker substitute for "Evil Eye of Selene" that provides different utility effects. "[[Evil Eye Repose]]" is a situational resource cycling and removal card.
  The other "Evil Eye" Spell/Traps round out the strategy with additional interruptions and utility, and they are also strengthened if the player has "Evil Eye of Selene" active. They typically require the player to control an "Evil Eye" monster to be activated.

  "Evil Eye" is almost always played as a control Deck, and typically centers on Normal Summoning "Serziel" (which itself can be searched through "Pareidolia") to search for "Evil Eye of Selene" and equipping it to "Serziel". The high-protection "Serziel" would then typically be backed up with staple cards; additional in-archetype cards beyond the "Serziel" engine is typically kept to a minimum, and are only searched if the player has additional searching capacity.
  Similarily to the minimalist "Evil Eye" control builds, "Serziel", "Evil Eye of Selene", and "Pareidolia" can also be played as a splashable engine, providing a potent Normal Summon for Decks that do not rely on Normal Summons.
