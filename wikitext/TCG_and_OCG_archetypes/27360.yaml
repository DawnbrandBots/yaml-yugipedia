  {{Quote|Walking with spirits day after day.<br />Dance with brilliant colors, oh [[Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin|one ring]]. |source=The tagline of ''[[Structure Deck: Masters of the Spiritual Arts]]'' in promotional material}}
  "'''Charmer'''", known as "'''Spirit Charmer'''" ({{Ruby|霊|れい}}{{Ruby|使|つか}}い ''Reitsukai'') in Asia, is an [[archetype]] of [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] of all main [[Attribute]]s. It is divided in three sub-series: the original [[Level]] 3 [[Spellcaster]] [[Flip monster]]s with 500 [[ATK]] and 1500 [[DEF]], [[Link Rating|Link]]-2 [[Link Monster]]s with 1850 [[ATK]], and the Level 5 Channelers with 1850 ATK and 1500 DEF. It is also supported by the "[[Possessed]]" archetype and related to the [[Cataclysmic Charmer]] and [[Spiritual Art]] series, and has a [[Charmer (Rush Duel)|''Rush Duel'' version]].

  == History ==
  The "Charmer" archetype has a very long history, covering almost the game's entire lifespan.

  The original four monster ("[[Aussa the Earth Charmer|Aussa]]", "[[Eria the Water Charmer|Eria]]", "[[Hiita the Fire Charmer|Hiita]]", and "[[Wynn the Wind Charmer|Wynn]]") were released in ''[[The Lost Millennium]]'' (2005). Two sets later, in ''[[Elemental Energy]]'', they received their first powered-up forms in the "[[Familiar-Possessed]]" archetype, and their adult forms (the [[Cataclysmic Charmer]]s) were released two sets after that in ''[[Enemy of Justice]]'' (2006).

  "[[Dharc the Dark Charmer|Dharc]]" and "[[Lyna the Light Charmer|Lyna]]", the [[DARK]] and [[LIGHT]] members, were subjected to a much more sluggish schedule: "Dharc" was released in ''[[The Duelist Genesis]]'' (2008) and did not get his "Familiar-Possessed" form until 14 sets later in ''[[Order of Chaos]]'' (2011), and "Lyna", from ''[[The Shining Darkness]]'' (2010) had to wait  for hers in ''[[Maximum Crisis]]'' (2017), a full 28-sets span. Neither has received an adult version. "Dharc" appears to be the only male "Charmer"; this is supported by his German, Italian, and Spanish names using the masculine nouns "Zauberer", "Ammaliatore", and "Encantador" instead of the feminine "Zaubererin", "Ammaliatrice", and "Encantadora" (though the French name contrasts this with the feminine "Charmeuse").

  The [[Link Rating|Link]]-2 [[Link Monster]]s began with "[[Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze]]" in ''[[Savage Strike]]'' (2018) and were completed as a sextet with "[[Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy]]" in ''[[Battle of Chaos]]'' (2021). The Channelers were established with "[[Wynn the Wind Channeler]]", the [[V Jump January 2020 promotional card|''V Jump January 2020'' promotional card]], and are still in the process of coming out.

  While all six characters appear in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! CARD GAME THE CHRONICLES (promotional video)|''Yu-Gi-Oh! CARD GAME THE CHRONICLES'' promotional video]] (2024), the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! CARD GAME THE CHRONICLES|series of the same name two years later]] only features the original quartet. Concurrently with the latter appearance, the quartet was given two [[Extra Deck]] monsters representing all of them: the [[Fusion Monster]] "[[Charmers of the Grand Circle]]" and the Link-4 Link Monster "[[Four Charmers in Profusion]]".

  The Deck's popularity is enough that it reached third place out of 20 choices in the 2019 [[Structure Deck "Theme" Poll Plan]] (winning them the creation of ''[[Structure Deck: Masters of the Spiritual Arts]]'' the year after), as well as an [[Charmer (Rush Duel)|adaptation]] to ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel]]'' in ''[[Over Rush Pack 4]]'' (2026).

  == Lore ==
  {{See also|Master Guide 2 card storylines#File No. 03: The Four Girls of the Duel World}}

  == Design ==
  There is one "Charmer" character for each of the six main [[Attribute]]s, each with various versions. Their effects heavily focus on [[Attributes]]:
  * The [[Flip monster]] take [[control]] of 1 opponent's face-up monster with their Attribute when flipped face-up, for as long as the "Charmer" remains [[face-up]] on the [[field]].
  * The [[Link Monster]]s require 1 monster with their Attribute as material plus any other monster, and are also treated as "[[Familiar-Possessed]]" members. They can [[Special Summon]]s monsters with their Attribute from the opponent's [[Graveyard]] to the zones they [[Points to|point to]], and when they are [[destroy]]ed after being [[Link Summon]]ed, they let their player add 1 monster with their Attribute and 1500 or less DEF from the Deck to the hand.
  * The Channelers can discard themselves and a monster with the same Attribute to add another monster of that Attribute from the Deck to the hand, preventing the player activating any effects of monster with different ones for that turn, and can Special Summon themselves from the hand if a monster with their Attribute is destroyed by battle.

  Each "Charmer" is accompanied by a familiar, a Level 1 or 2 monster with the same Attribute (all [[Normal Monster]]s from the earliest ''[[OCG]]'' sets, aside from "[[Fox Fire]]"), and are depicted on [[Spiritual Art]] cards (except for "Dharc"). The "[[Familiar-Possessed]]" feature powered-up versions of both; these modified familiars were later made into their own cards, and then were further evolved into the "Awakening of the [[Possessed]]" series. The Link Monsters feature different, more uniform-looking familiars. Both familiars are depicted on the Channeler monsters, implying the newer set are additionals rather than replacements.

  {{Charmers}}

  The "Charmers" Flip monsters are some of the few cards whose illustrator is know, that being [[Akina Fujiwara]].

  == Playing style ==
  "[[Unpossessed]]" is the key card of the Deck, preventing "Charmer" monsters from being destroyed by battle, which allows their Flip effects to be used properly, and Special Summoning Spellcaster monsters with 1500 DEF from the Deck, including non-members like "[[Injection Fairy Lily]]" or "[[Windwitch - Glass Bell]]".

  "[[Awakening of the Possessed]]" increases the ATK of the player's monsters, protects "Charmers" and "Familiar-Possessed" monsters from being destroyed by card effects, and lets the player draw cards when monsters with 1850 original ATK are Summoned, again including non-members such as the "[[Fairy Tail]]" monsters.
