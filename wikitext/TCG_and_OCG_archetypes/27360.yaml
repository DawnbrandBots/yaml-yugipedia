  {{Quote|Walking with spirits day after day.<br />Dance with brilliant colors, oh [[Grand Spiritual Art - Ichirin|one ring]]. |source=The tagline of ''[[Structure Deck: Masters of the Spiritual Arts]]'' in promotional material}}
  "'''Charmer'''", known as "'''Spirit Charmer'''" ({{Ruby|霊|れい}}{{Ruby|使|つか}}い ''Reitsukai'') in the Japanese version, is an [[archetype]] of six [[Level]] 3 [[Spellcaster]] [[Flip monster]]s with 500 [[ATK]] and 1500 [[DEF]].

  == History ==
  The original four "Charmers", "[[Aussa the Earth Charmer|Aussa]]", "[[Eria the Water Charmer|Eria]]", "[[Hiita the Fire Charmer|Hiita]]", and "[[Wynn the Wind Charmer|Wynn]]", were first released in ''[[The Lost Millennium]]''. Two packs later, in ''[[Elemental Energy]]'', they had their "[[Familiar-Possessed]]" forms released, and their final forms were released two packs after that, in ''[[Enemy of Justice]]''. "[[Dharc the Dark Charmer|Dharc]]" and "[[Lyna the Light Charmer|Lyna]]", the [[DARK]] and [[LIGHT]] "Charmers", do not follow this trend: "Dharc", which was released in ''[[The Duelist Genesis]]'', did not get his "Familiar-Possessed" form until 14 packs later in ''[[Order of Chaos]]'', and "Lyna", which was released in ''[[The Shining Darkness]]'', did not get her "Familiar-Possessed" form until it came out 28 packs latter in ''[[Maximum Crisis]]''. "Dharc" appears to be the only male "Charmer" in the archetype; this is supported by its German, Italian and Spanish names (with the masculine nouns "Zauberer", "Ammaliatore" and "Encantador" instead of the feminine "Zaubererin", "Ammaliatrice" and "Encantadora"), but refuted by its French name (with the feminine "Charmeuse").

  == Design ==
  There is one "Charmer" for each of the six main [[Attribute|Attributes]]. The [[effect]] of each "Charmer" allows it to take control of 1 opponent's face-up monster of the same Attribute as that "Charmer" after it was flipped face-up, for as long as the "Charmer" stays [[face-up]] on the [[field]].
  Each "Charmer" features a familiar, a Level 1 or 2 monster with the same Attribute as the "Charmer", most being Normal Monsters from the earliest ''[[OCG]]'' sets. They also also have two sets of advanced forms ("[[Familiar-Possessed]]s" and [[Cataclysmic Charmer]]s), and a series of similarly Attribute-centered Trap Cards known as [[Spiritual Art]]s depicting them.
  According to ''[[The Valuable Book 8]]'', 「霊使い」 stands for 「{{Ruby|精|せい}}{{Ruby|霊|れい}}使い」 (Spirit Charmer), 「霊術」 stands for 「{{Ruby|精|せい}}{{Ruby|霊|れい}}{{ruby|術|じゅつ}}」 (Spirit Art).
  [[Akina Fujiwara]] designed the "Charmers", although she did not draw their Cataclysmic forms.

  == Playing style ==
  "[[Unpossessed]]" is the key card of this deck, preventing "Charmer" monsters from being destroyed by battle allowing their effects to be activated, and also to Special Summon Spellcaster monsters with 1500 DEF from the Deck, including non-members of this archetype like "[[Injection Fairy Lily]]" or "[[Windwitch - Glass Bell]]".
  "[[Awakening of the Possessed]]" increase the ATK of the player's monsters, protect "Charmers" and "Familiar-Possessed" monsters from being destroyed by card effects and also let the player draw a card if a monster with 1850 original ATK is Normal/Special Summoned, including non-members of this archetype like the "[[Fairy Tail]]" monsters.
