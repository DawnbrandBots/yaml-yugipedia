  "'''Tachyon'''" (タキオン ''Takion'') is an [[archetype]] focusing on "[[Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]" and its "[[Number C]]" version, "[[Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]" which are used by [[Mizar]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]''. It received its first ''OCG'' support in ''[[Duelist Pack: Duelists of Brilliance]]''. The "[[Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]" archetype is its sub-archetype.

  ==Etymology==
  A [[wikipedia:Tachyon|tachyon]], or tachyonic particle, is a hypothetical particle that always moves faster than light, which would be in contrast to the currently-understood laws of physics dictating that nothing can do so. The word comes from the Greek word ''tachys'', meaning "swift, quick, fast, rapid". This is a reference to the rivalry between Mizar's "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" and [[Kite Tenjo]]'s "[[Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon]]".

  ==Design==
  "Tachyon" monsters serve as counterparts to the "[[Photon]]" archetype, reflecting their anime owners' relationship. Visually they feature a space motif, much like other archetypes related to the "[[Galaxy]]" theme, but distinguish themselves by also focusing more exclusively on a draconic motif than the other "Galaxy" cards. The dragons in question generally have abstract/mechanical designs rather than traditional western dragon appearances, with the original "Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" having a vague similarity to H. R. Giger's iconic xenomorph design for the ''Alien'' franchise; though related cards such as "[[Divine Golden Shadow Dragon Dragluxion]]" sometimes also incorporate eastern dragon elements.

  The colors black, gold, and magenta feature prominently in "Tachyon" monsters' designs; the black may be meant to contract the light-representing "Photon" monsters with darkness, while the magenta might be a reference to the fact that it is the only non-spectral basic color (i.e. it is constructed by the human brain sorely when red and blue photons overlap, as no such thing as a magenta photon exists).

  ==Playing style==
  Mechanically, the archetype and its related cards focus on easily summoning out powerful [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] monsters (giving them some "[[Chaos]]" synergy), negating the opponent's attempts to overpower them, and [[Xyz Summon]]ing using weaker Xyz Monsters as material.
