  "'''Tachyon'''" (タキオン ''Takion'') is an [[archetype]] focusing on "[[Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]" and its "[[Number C]]" version, "[[Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]" which are used by [[Mizar]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]''. It received its first ''OCG'' support in ''[[Duelist Pack: Duelists of Brilliance]]''. The "[[Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]" archetype is its sub-archetype.

  A [[wikipedia:Tachyon|tachyon]] or tachyonic particle is a hypothetical particle that always moves faster than light, and most physicists believe they cannot exist because they are not consistent with the natural laws of physics. The word comes from the Greek word ''tachys'', meaning "swift, quick, fast, rapid". This is a reference to the rivalry between Mizar's "Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" and [[Kite Tenjo]]'s "[[Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon]]".

  ==Design==
  "Tachyon" monsters serve somewhat as negative counterparts to the "[[Photon]]" archetype, reflecting their anime owners' relationship. Visually they feature a space motif, much like other archetypes related to the "[[Galaxy]]" theme, but distinguish themselves by also focusing more exclusively on a draconic motif than the other "Galaxy" cards. The dragons in question generally have abstract/sci-fi appearances rather than traditional Western appearances (the original "Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon" has a certain amount of similarity to H. R. Giger's iconic xenomorph design for the ''Alien'' franchise), though related cards such as "[[Dragluxion]]" sometimes also incorporate Eastern elements. The colors black and/or gold feature prominently.

  ==Playing style==
  Mechanically, the archetype and its related cards focus on easily summoning out powerful [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] monsters (giving them some "[[Chaos]]" synergy), negating the opponent's attempts to overpower them, and [[Xyz Summon]]ing using weaker Xyz Monsters as material.
