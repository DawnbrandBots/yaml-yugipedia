  "'''Exodia'''" (エクゾディア, ''Ekuzodia'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]], with its first member released in ''[[Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon]]'' and its first support released in ''[[Millennium Box Gold Edition]]''. They are focused on alternative [[victory condition]]s. It is related to the "[[Forbidden One]]" archetype.

  While many people refer to the "[[Forbidden One]]" cards as "Exodia" cards, only "Exodia the Forbidden One" (the head) is part of this archetype.

  == Exodia cards ==
  "Exodia the Forbidden One" is one of the most iconic cards in the franchise, being well known for its automatic win condition and Yugi's use of it in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 001|first episode]] of the anime. While the primary purpose of "Exodia" is to declare an automatic win through having all five pieces of the "Forbidden One" per the victory condition of "[[Exodia the Forbidden One]]", there are other ways to use it, usually for other alternate victory conditions.

  ! scope="col" | Exodia card
  ! scope="col" | Description
  |-
  | [[Exodia the Forbidden One]]
  | Automatic win if all five "Forbidden One" pieces are in the player's hand.
  |-
  | [[Exodia Necross]]
  | Requires all five "Forbidden One" pieces in the Graveyard to summon and remain on the field. Not an alternate win, but gains 500 ATK for each of its owner's [[Standby Phase]], and cannot be destroyed by battle/[[Spell Cards|Spell]]/[[Trap Cards|Trap]]. Intended to be a trump card or backup plan if too many "Forbidden One" pieces end up in the GY.
  |-
  | [[Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord]]
  | Requires all monsters in the GY to be shuffled to summoned. Sends 1 "Forbidden One" piece to the GY when attacking. Automatic win if all five "Forbidden One" pieces are in the GY.
  |-
  |[[Exodia, the Legendary Defender]]
  | A reference to when Exodia battled [[Zorc Necrophades]]. Automatic win if it is [[Tribute Summon]]ed by [[Tribute|tributing]] 5 monsters, and it destroys a DARK [[Fiend]] monster owned by your opponent in battle.
  |-
  |[[The Legendary Exodia Incarnate]]
  |Must be Special Summoned by tributing 1 "Forbidden One" monster. Not an alternate win condition, but is unaffected by card effects, gains ATK from each "Forbidden One" monster in the GY, and adds 1 "Forbidden One" monster from the GY to the hand each turn.
  |-
  |[[True Exodia]]
  |A joke card; provides an alternate win condition for its controller's opponent. Automatic win (to the opponent) if the only monsters on the field are itself and 1 each of the 4 "Forbidden One" [[Normal Monster]]s.
  |-
  |[[The Unstoppable Exodia Incarnate]]
  |Requires all five "Forbidden One" pieces in the Deck/hand/field to be summoned. Not an alternate win condition, instead serving as the main boss monster for the "[[Millennium]]" archetype, which aims to win through regular means.

  == Lore ==
  {{main|Forbidden One#Lore}}

  === In the anime ===
  {{main|Forbidden One#In the anime}}

  == Play style ==
  {{main|Exodia OTK}}

  Exodia decks have one of two playstyles:
  * Aims to win through "Exodia the Foridden One"'s win condition, either with draw/search power, or by using [[stall]] cards.
  * Aims to bring out an "Exodia" boss monster, which either has its own alternate win condition, or is intended to help beat the opponent through regular means.

  == Trivia ==
  * "Exodia the Forbidden One" was the first card with alternate win condition. It, as well as the other "Forbidden One" cards were the only monsters ever specifically mentioned in the rulebooks (other than as an example), due to this fact. They are no longer mentioned in the rulebook, as Exodia's [[card text]] suffices to clarify its effect.
  * In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum]]'', the player can fuse the five pieces of "Exodia" to Summon "[[Summoned Lord Exodia]]", the complete Exodia (but it will be only like a normal fusion piece), with an ability to cause massive damage on the monsters that is in range, that is known by "Obliterate".
  * In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses]]'', "[[Summoned Lord Exodia]]" can be unlocked in the library when the player successfully Summons Exodia, but it cannot be viewed in 3D and the only properties which are displayed are [[Type]] (which is [[Spellcaster]]) and [[Attribute]] (which is [[DARK]]).
