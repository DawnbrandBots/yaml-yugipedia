  "'''Vision HERO'''" ({{Ruby|Ｖ・ＨＥＲＯ|ヴィジョンヒーロー}} ''Vijon Hīrō'' in Japan, formatted as {{Ruby|Ｖ|ヴィジョン}}・{{Ruby|ＨＥＲＯ|ヒーロー}} in the Japanese manga), is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]], as well as a sub-archetype of the "[[HERO]]" archetype, used by [[Aster Phoenix (manga)|Aster Phoenix]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (manga)|''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' manga]].
  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  Most "Vision HERO" monsters wear helmets with a singular lens where the face would be, and have an almost robotic appearance.
  ===Etymology===
  [[File:Vision Heroes S-T Zone.png|thumb|left|[[Aster Phoenix (manga)|Aster]] with 3 "Vision HERO" monsters as "visions" in his [[Spell & Trap Card Zone]].]]The name of this archetype comes from their change in appearance and functionality while in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]]. In the manga, while in the in the Spell & Trap Zone, "Vision HERO" monsters are called "visions" or "mirages" (in Japanese, Aster calls them 「{{Ruby|幻影|ヴィジョン}}」, which is written with the kanji for "phantom" but read as "vision").
  {{-|left}}
  ==Playing style==
  The archetype's playstyle involves using the Level 3 "Vision HERO" monsters' effects to be placed in the Spell & Trap Zone as Continuous Traps (a.k.a. "vision" effects) to swarm the field and gain advantage, and summon the archetype's boss monsters via [[Tribute Summon]] or [[Fusion Summon]].
  The Level 3 "Vision HERO" monsters share the following three [[only once per turn]] effects:
  # ''"If you take battle or effect damage while this card is in your GY: You can place this card from your GY in your Spell & Trap Zone as a face-up Continuous Trap."''
  # ''"During the Main Phase, if this card is treated as a Continuous Trap: You can Tribute 1 "HERO" monster; Special Summon this card."''
  # ''"If this card is Special Summoned from the Spell & Trap Zone: You can [Individual Effect]."''

  ! Level 3 Vision HERO
  ! Additional Individual Effect<!--Copied directly from card text-->
  |-
  | [[Vision HERO Increase|Increase]]
  | Special Summon 1 Level 4 or lower "Vision HERO" monster from your Deck. 
  |-
  | [[Vision HERO Minimum Ray|Minimum Ray]]
  | Destroy 1 Level 4 or lower monster your opponent controls.

  | [[Vision HERO Multiply Guy|Multiply Guy]]
  | Make 1 face-up monster on the field gain 800 ATK.
  |-
  | [[Vision HERO Poisoner|Poisoner]]
  | Halve the ATK of 1 face-up monster on the field. 
  |}
  Among these effects, the individual effect of "Increase" is easily the most valuable as it Special Summons additional "Vision HERO" monsters directly from the Deck. 

  The non-Level 3 "Vision HERO" monsters (excluding "[[Vision HERO Witch Raider|Witch Raider]]") have effects that trigger when they are Normal or Special Summoned. "[[Vision HERO Vyon|Vyon]]" sends 1 "HERO" monster from the Deck to the GY, "[[Vision HERO Gravito|Gravito]]" adds 1 banished "HERO" monster to the hand, and "[[Vision HERO Faris|Faris]]" places 1 "Vision HERO" from the Deck into the Spell & Trap Zone. "Vyon" and "Gravito" are Level 4 monsters, and can thus be Special Summoned from the Deck by the effect of "Increase", while "Faris" is Level 5, but has its own effect to Special Summon itself from the hand by discarding another "HERO" monster.

  "Vyon" and "Gravito" have additional [[Ignition Effect]]s in addition to their [[Trigger Effect]]s. "Vyon" can banish 1 "HERO" monster from the GY to search 1 "[[Polymerization]]", while "Gravito" can Tribute itself to Special Summon 2 "Vision HERO" monsters in the S&T zones. Combined together, "Faris" is an important extender and searcher from the Deck, "Vyon" sets up the GY with more "HERO" monsters and can search "Polymerization" to enable summons of "HERO" Fusion boss monsters, while "Gravito" is a situational recovery tool.

  The archetype's Level 8 Tribute Summon boss monster, "[[Vision HERO Witch Raider|Witch Raider]]", can be Tribute Summoned by Tributing Trap cards the player controls, in addition to monsters, allowing the "Vision HERO" monsters in the S&T zones to be used as tributes. When Normal Summoned, "Witch Raider" can destroy all Spell/Traps the opponent controls. The archetype's Fusion boss monsters, "[[Vision HERO Adoration|Adoration]]" and "[[Vision HERO Trinity|Trinity]]", require generic "HERO" monsters as Fusion Materials, and have ATK manipulation and (for "Trinity") multi-attacking effects, making them good for [[OTK]]s.

  Because "Vision HERO" monsters generically support "HERO" monsters outside of their "vision" effects, the archetype strongly supports, and is strongly supported by the "[[HERO]]" meta-archetype, with general "HERO" support giving the archetype more flexibility, and "Vision HERO" itself giving other "HERO" archetypes multiple extenders, situational tools, and boss monsters. The "Vision HERO" archetype is often compacted into an engine of "Faris", "Increase", and "Vyon"; "Faris" will Special Summon itself from the hand and place "Increase" in the S&T zone, who will tribute "Faris" to Special Summon itself and "Vyon", and "Vyon" will send other "HERO" monsters to the GY for their GY effects (usually "[[Destiny HERO]]" monsters or "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]") and search out a "Polymerization" to enable "HERO" Fusion plays, all the while Special Summoning multiple "HERO" monsters that can also enable [[Link Summon]]s of "HERO" [[Link Monster]]s (such as those from the [[Xtra HERO]] series).
