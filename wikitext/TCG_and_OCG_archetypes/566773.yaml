  "'''Mayakashi'''" ({{Ruby|魔妖|まやかし}} ''Mayakashi'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Zombie]] monsters that debuted in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Hidden Summoners]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Master Guide 6 card storylines#File No. 04: The Quarrel Between the "Mayakashi" and the "Shiranui" Continues with the Tale of "Ghost Meets Girl"}}
  The archetype is related by lore to the "[[Shiranui]]" archetype.

  == Etymology ==
  The Japanese name of "Mayakashi" combines the kanji ''ma'' (魔, "evil spirit") and the kanji ''ayakashi'' (妖, "attractive; calamity"), a general term for spirits or ''yōkai''. The reading for ''Mayakashi'' (まやかし) is also a homophone of the Japanese word for "deception" (贋 ''mayakashi''), which refers to the archetype's theme of specters disguised as humans.

  == Design ==
  The members of this archetype are based on various ''[[wikipedia:Yōkai|yōkai]]'' from Japanese folklore. The Main Deck monsters appear to be the human disguises of the Extra Deck monsters of the same kind of "Mayakashi" (e.g. "Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi" transforms into "Yoko, the Graceful Mayakashi").
  "Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi" and her counterparts are the only Extra Deck monsters that are [[Link Monster]]s. The rest of the Extra Deck monsters are all [[Synchro Monster]]s.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Mayakashi" playstyle is focused on using the effect of "[[Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi]]" to repeatedly Special Summon it from the GY after using it as Synchro or Link Material, and Synchro/Link climb through the archetype's entire Extra Deck. Secondarily, the archetype is focused on triggering monster effects by Special Summoning its monsters, including Extra Deck monsters, from the GY.

  "[[Dakki, the Graceful Mayakashi]]" has the non-once per turn effect where when a "Mayakashi" monster is Special Summoned to the player's field from the Extra Deck, while it is in the GY, it can Special Summon itself back onto the field. This effect also triggers when "Dakki" itself is used as a material for the summon of the "Mayakashi" Extra Deck monster, allowing the archetype to perform its Synchro and Link climbs.

  The archetype's other Main Deck monsters provide more utility and board building capabilities. The two most valuable ones are "[[Hajun, the Winged Mayakashi]]", who can Special Summon "Dakki" from the Deck and immediately set up the Deck's Synchro and Link plays, and "[[Yuki-Musume, the Ice Mayakashi]]", who is an extender that can mill "[[Mezuki]]" for another extension. Notably, all "Mayakashi" Main Deck monsters prevents the player from Special Summoning non-"Mayakashi" monsters from the Extra Deck, either as a Continuous Effect, or as a Condition attached to their effect activations. This strict restriction greatly limits the Deck's Extra Deck options.

  The archetype has five Synchro Monsters at Levels 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and three Link Monsters at Link Ratings 2-4. Each of them have a [[side-unique]] condition. Using the effect of "Dakki", each of these monsters can be summoned one after another, cycling through the archetype's entire Extra Deck.

  Each "Mayakashi" Synchro Monster has 2 effects. The first effect is a "level down" effect, where, if a friendly Link Monster (for "[[Gashadokuro, the Skeletal Mayakashi|Gashadokuro]]") or Synchro Monster whose original Level is 2 higher than themselves (for all except "Gashadokuro") is destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect, they can banish 1 other Zombie monster from GY to Special Summon themselves from the GY. Their second effect is a trigger effect activated if they're Special Summoned from the GY.

  These effects can be preemptively used with generic effects like "[[Book of Life]]", "[[Mezuki]]", and "[[Call of the Haunted]]", or with in-archetype cards like "[[Mayakashi Metamorphosis]]", "[[Mayakashi Winter]]", and "[[Yuki-Onna, the Icicle Mayakashi]]". "Yoko" and "Tengu" in particular can be Special Summoned in the opponent's turn as disruption.

  The archetype has three Link monsters, the Link-2 "[[Yuki-Onna, the Ice Mayakashi]]" and her [[Yuki-Onna, the Icicle Mayakashi|Link-3]] and [[Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi|Link-4 evolutions]].
  * The Link-2 "Yuki-Onna" has conditional protection and stat reduction effects. Both effects are very situational, so she's primarily used as a bridge for Link climbing.
  * The Link-3 "Yuki-Onna" can negate the effects of 1 opposing monster when Special Summoned, and can banish itself from the GY as a [[Quick Effect]] to Special Summon a [[Zombie]] Synchro Monster from banish pile or GY. Her effects are useful for board-breaking, board building, and Quick Effect disruption (by Special Summoning "Yoko" and "Tengu" in the opponent's turn).
  * The Link-4 "Yuki-Onna", as a trigger effect, can negate the effects of 1 monster and reduce its ATK to 0, triggered if any monster is Special Summoned from the GY, or if a monster effect is activated in the GY. Due to her high ATK, and relatively more flexible effect activation requirements, she is the main board presence for the archetype.

  "Mayakashi" Spell/Traps back up its playstyle with more consistency, board suppression, and conditional tools. The most valuable "Mayakashi" Spell/Traps are "[[Mayakashi Return]]", the Deck's search Spell, and "[[Ghost Meets Girl - A Masterful Mayakashi Shiranui Saga]]", a powerful suppression Trap that prevents the opponent from Special Summoning from all locations except the Graveyard for a turn, if the player Tributes a "Mayakashi" or "Shiranui" Synchro or Link Monster.

  Because the archetype Special Summons so many Zombie monsters in one turn, the archetype is an excellent enabler for a "[[Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower]]" [[mill]] strategy. The archetype can Special Summon at least 28 times in a single turn (10 in Synchro climb, 6 in Link Climb, then repeat Link climb twice more), letting "Soul-Absorbing Bone Tower" mill 56 cards in one turn, enough to Deck out all Decks regardless of Deck size.

  Since this deck can place many different monster in the GY in one turn, "[[Orbital Hydralander]]" can be easily summoned and its effect allows the player to destroy a opponent's card while milling the deck.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "Mayakashi" depends on its GY to perform its combos and disrupt the opponent. Cards that shut down or disrupt the GY, such as "[[Necrovalley]]", "[[Abyss Dweller]]", "[[Skull Meister]]", or "[[D.D. Crow]]", can cripple the Deck's strategy.
  * "[[Hajun, the Winged Mayakashi]]" is the largest choke point in the Deck's combos, and negating "Hajun" stops the Deck's combos in its tracks.
  * Without "[[Ghost Meets Girl - A Masterful Mayakashi Shiranui Saga]]", the archetype's usual end board, consisting of the conditional negates of "[[Yuki-Onna, the Absolute Zero Mayakashi]]" and the GY Special Summon of "[[Yuki-Onna, the Icicle Mayakashi]]", is generally not very effective at halting decks with multiple extenders.
