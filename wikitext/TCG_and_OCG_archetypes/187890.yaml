  "'''Vehicroid'''" (ビークロイド ''Bīkuroido'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] [[Fusion Monster]]s used by [[Syrus Truesdale]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]''. They are a sub-archetype of the "[[roid]]" archetype. In the anime, the "roid" archetype is referred to as "Vehicroids". With the exception of "[[Super Vehicroid - Mobile Base]]", all members of this archetype list "[[Drillroid]]" as one of its [[Fusion Material]]s. "[[Cycroid]]" is referred to as a "Vehicroid" in it's card text, however it is not treated as part of the archetype in gameplay due to its name.
