  "'''Genex'''" (ジェネクス ''Jenekusu'') is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with various [[Attribute]]s (primarily [[DARK]]) introduced in ''[[Limited Edition 13]]'' in the ''[[OCG]]'' and in ''[[Duel Terminal 1]]'' in the ''[[TCG]]''.

  Most of members' effects involves [[add]]ing monsters from the [[Deck]] to the [[hand]] and [[Special Summon]] them, as well as using "[[Genex Controller]]" with low-[[Level]] monsters of the four basic [[Attribute]]s for [[Synchro Summon]].

  A sub-archetype, "[[R-Genex]]", was added in ''[[Duel Terminal - Justice Strikes Back!!|Justice Strikes Back!!]]'', ''[[Duel Terminal - Champion of Chaos!!|Champion of Chaos!!]]'' and ''[[Duel Terminal - Charge of the Genex!!|Charge of the Genex!!]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#No. 13: "Duel Terminal" World Side Story - Program 'Return 0;'}}

  == Design ==
  The name of "Genex" [[Synchro Monster]]s are based on sources of energy such as [[Hydro Genex|hydroelectric]], [[Geo Genex|geothermal]], [[Genex Solar|solar]], etc.

  == Playing style ==
  The classic playstyle of the "Genex" archetype uses "[[Genex Controller]]" to achieve various effects and perform Synchro Summons, "R-Genex" focuses on assisting the Special Summon of "Genex" and "R-Genex" monsters for swarming, and "Genex Ally" focuses on manipulating the six Attributes to achieve different effects.

  The modern playstyle is entirely dependent on the Link-1 [[Link Monster]] "[[Repair Genex Controller]]". With "Repair Genex Controller", the player can [[Normal Summon]] a "Genex" monster each time a "Genex" monster is added to their hand (whether from the Deck, field, or GY), with no [[once per turn]] limit attached. Thus, by repeatedly adding "Genex" monsters to the hand, "Genex" can swarm large amounts of monsters for [[Extra Deck]] Synchro boss monsters.

  In-archetype, "Genex" has multiple non-once-per-turn ways to add "Genex" monsters to hand and enable their swarming. The key enablers are "Genex" monsters who search "Genex" monsters when Normal Summoned:

  |}
  {{Notelist}}

  By searching "Genex" monsters that are themselves on-Summon searchers, "Repair Genex Controller" can create "Summon chains" of Normal Summons, searches, and more Normal Summons. Importantly, as indicated by the underlined entries, "Turbo", "Power Planner", "Magma" and "Crusher" form a closed searching loop, providing (theoretically) infinite Normal Summons; "Power Planner", "Undine" and "Controller" also forms its own extended search chain.

  The "startup" for the "Summon chain" is provided by "Repair Genex Controller" itself, who adds a "Genex" monster from the GY to hand when Link Summoned.

  Because "Repair Genex Controller" triggers its effect immediately after adding a monster, it is important to search and Summon a "Genex" Tuner before running out of Main Monster Zones. The player can then Synchro Summon to free up MMZ space for future Summons.

  Once a "Summon chain" ends, the player can "restart" the "Summon chain" by using other effects to add "Genex" monsters to hand. In-archetype, "[[Genex Ally Birdman]]" and "[[R-Genex Undine]]" can both perform this task (from the hand and GY respectively), with both having the added bonus of being (or being able to become) Tuners. External "Genex" searching, such as "[[Small World]]" or "[[Bonfire]]", or methods to return cards from the field to the hand, such as "[[Dewloren, Tiger King of the Ice Barrier]]" and "[[Merry Melffys]]", can also restart the "Summon chain".

  Through the swarming enabled by "Repair Genex Controller" and its "Summon chains", "Genex" can easily gather materials for Synchro boss monsters; "Genex" cannot leverage the swarming for non-Synchro Extra Deck monsters because "Repair Genex Controller" locks the player into only Synchro Summons, and only with "Genex" Tuners. However, it doesn't [[xenolock]] the Synchro Monsters themselves, permitting a varierty of boss options like the in-archetype "[[Arms of Genex Return Zero]]" (which grants in-archetype resource recovery) or the generic "[[Baronne de Fleur]]".

  === Tips ===
  * Since it is vital to resolve the effect of "[[Repair Genex Controller]]", cards such as "[[Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended]]", "[[Link into the VRAINS!]]" and "[[Crossout Designator]]" are recommended in order to protect it.
  * "[[PSY-Framelord Omega]]" is a great choice to Synchro Summon, since it can banish itself and a card from the opponent's hand. Not only this reduces the opponent's resources, but it also opens more zones for the player to use.
  * Among the starters, "[[Genex Power Planner]]" is usually one of the best options to return from the field to the hand, since it can search both "[[Genex Ally Birdman]]" and "[[Genex Undine]]", important pieces to finish the player's combos.
  * If the player controls a "Genex" monster and a Level 6-8 DARK non-Tuner monster, "[[R-Genex Turing]]" can Summon itself from the hand during the opponent's turn to Synchro Summon "[[Locomotion R-Genex]]" and take control of one of the opponent's monsters. The non-Tuner monster may be a Synchro Monster (e.g. "[[Draco Berserker of the Tenyi]]"), or a "[[Bystial]]" monster (such as "[[Bystial Druiswurm]]") for builds that use them.
  * "[[Genex Ally Axel]]", a Synchro Monster that also requires a "Genex" Tuner, can Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Machine monster back from the GY, allowing for even more Synchro Summons.
