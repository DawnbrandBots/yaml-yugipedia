  "'''Black Luster Soldier'''", known as "'''Chaos Soldier'''" (カオス・ソルジャー ''Kaosu Sorujā'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yugi Muto]]/[[Yami Yugi]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|manga]], as well as [[Dimitri]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, that includes "[[Black Luster Soldier]]" and monsters based on it. Members of this archetype have existed since the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters National Tournament'', but did not receive [[support]] until ''[[Dimension of Chaos]]''.
  Due to its OCG name, "Black Luster Soldier" is a sub-archetype of the "[[Chaos]]" Ritual archetype, and is supported in gameplay by "Chaos" Ritual support. As such, in the TCG, "Chaos" Ritual Monsters and "Black Luster Soldier" Ritual Monsters are supported individually in all "Chaos" support. This archetype is also related by gameplay to the "[[Gaia The Fierce Knight (archetype)|Gaia The Fierce Knight]]" archetype.
  The archetype is also related by gameplay and aesthetic themes to the [[Chaos (series)|LIGHT and DARK Chaos]] series.

  == Members ==
  All "Black Luster Soldier" monsters have 3000 ATK, and, save for the Link 3 "[[Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos]]", are all [[Level]] 8 and have 2500 [[DEF]]. All "Black Luster Soldier" monsters are [[EARTH]] or [[LIGHT]] monsters, except for the [[DARK]] "[[Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Evening Twilight]]".

  == Playing style ==
  A pure "Black Luster Soldier" Deck is a [[Ritual Summon|Ritual]]-focused Deck, focusing on Ritual Summoning "Black Luster Soldier" Ritual Monsters.
  Of the many search effects of this archetype, the most prominent are those of the [[Field Spell Card]] "[[Gateway to Chaos]]", which can add either a "[[Black Luster Soldier]]" Ritual Monster or a "Gaia the Fierce Knight" monster upon activation, and with enough [[Spell Counter]]s can also search for any [[Ritual Spell Card]]. Leftover counters can be used to activate the effect of "[[Super Soldier Shield]]" in the Graveyard. "[[Beginning of Heaven and Earth]]" can set up the Graveyard or "[[Super Soldier Synthesis]]" to [[Ritual Summon]] him from the Hand or Graveyard.
  "Super Soldier Synthesis", "[[Envoy of Chaos]]" and "[[Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands]]" tend to make Decklists of this archetype Level 4 based because of needing Tribute of exactly Level 8.
  "[[Super Soldier Soul]]" can Banish itself from the Graveyard to search either Level 4 "[[Evening Twilight Knight]]" and "[[Beginning Knight]]" Monsters, which can also search when Banished but cannot do this themselves and need effects of "Chaos" Monsters like "[[Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning|Envoy of the Beginning]]", "[[Lightpulsar Dragon]]", "[[Black Dragon Collapserpent]]" and "[[White Dragon Wyverburster]]" or the [[Ritual Spell Card]] "[[Super Soldier Ritual]]" to activate them.
  "[[Black Luster Soldier - Sacred Soldier]]" can be searched or Special Summoned by the effects of both the "Gaia The Fierce Knight" monsters, is able to recycle Banished cards to the Graveyard and can return a Warrior monster from the Graveyard to the Hand when destroys an opponent monster by battle.
  "Black Luster" cards are sometimes run alongside "[[Trade-In]]" and "[[The Melody of Awakening Dragon]] to search cards from the "[[Blue-Eyes]]" archetype.  Using either "[[Chaos Form]]" or "[[Advanced Ritual Art]]" to their fullest.
