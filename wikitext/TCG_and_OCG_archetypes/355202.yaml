  "'''Black Luster Soldier'''", known as "'''Chaos Soldier'''" (カオス・ソルジャー ''Kaosu Sorujā'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yugi Muto]]/[[Yami Yugi]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|manga]], as well as [[Dimitri]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, that includes "[[Black Luster Soldier]]" and monsters based on it. Members of this archetype have existed since the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters National Tournament'', but did not receive [[support]] until ''[[Dimension of Chaos]]''.

  Due to its OCG name, "Black Luster Soldier" is a sub-archetype of the "[[Chaos]]" archetype. In the TCG, any card that supports "Chaos" Ritual Monsters will also support "Black Luster Soldier" Ritual Monsters. This archetype is also related by theme and gameplay to the "[[Gaia The Fierce Knight (archetype)|Gaia The Fierce Knight]]" archetype, as well as the [[Chaos (series)|LIGHT and DARK Chaos]] series.

  == Members ==
  All "Black Luster Soldier" monsters have 3000 ATK, and, save for the Link 3 "[[Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos]]", are all [[Level]] 8 and have 2500 [[DEF]]. All "Black Luster Soldier" monsters are [[EARTH]] or [[LIGHT]] monsters, except for the [[DARK]] "[[Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Evening Twilight]]".

  == Playing style ==
  A pure "Black Luster Soldier" Deck focuses on Summoning "Black Luster Soldier" [[Ritual Monster]]s. Many cards are inspired by "[[Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning]]" - they have effects to [[banish]] cards and attack multiple times - so the archetype best fits a going second strategy.

  "[[Super Soldier Synthesis]]" is the archetype's most potent Ritual Spell, able to send 1 card from Deck to GY to fulfil the Level requirement. "[[Beginning Knight]]" and "[[Evening Twilight Knight]]" are thematic fodder, giving the "Black Luster Soldier" Ritual extra effects. They also act as LIGHT and DARK monsters, that, when banished, can search a Ritual Spell/Trap. "[[Super Soldier Soul]]" + a Level 7 monster (e.g., the "Gaia" monsters) is another option,  that can search one of the two former cards if sent to the GY.

  "[[Gateway to Chaos]]", the in-archetype searcher, can add either a "[[Black Luster Soldier]]" Ritual Monster or a "Gaia the Fierce Knight" monster upon activation, and with enough [[Spell Counter]]s can also search for any [[Ritual Spell Card]]. The archetype benefits from general Ritual support, such as "[[Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands]]".

  "[[Black Luster Soldier - Sacred Soldier]]" can be searched or Special Summoned by the effects of both of the archetype-related "Gaia The Fierce Knight" monsters, is able to recycle banished cards to the Graveyard and can return a Warrior monster from the Graveyard to the Hand when destroys an opponent monster by battle.

  "Black Luster Soldier" monsters can be run inside a "[[Blue-Eyes]]" Deck, due to direct ("[[Chaos Form]]", "[[Dragon Master Magia]]") and indirect ("[[Trade-In]]") support. If nothing else, they can be discarded for "[[Wishes for Eyes of Blue]]" or "[[The Melody of Awakening Dragon]]".
