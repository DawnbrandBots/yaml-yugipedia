  "'''roid'''" (ロイド ''roido'') is an [[archetype]] of cards originally released in ''[[Cybernetic Revolution]]'' and further supported in ''[[Power of the Duelist]]'' and ''[[Gladiator's Assault]]''. Informally, the "roid" cards are sometimes referred to as "[[Vehicroid]]s", which is technically a sub-archetype of this one. The archetype also contains another sub-archetype, the "[[Speedroid]]s". All intended "roid" cards are cartoon versions of some form of vehicle. They are used by [[Syrus Truesdale]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime and manga, and the "Speedroid" archetype is used by [[Yugo]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime and manga.

  "[[Elemental HERO Necroid Shaman]]", "[[Dark Jeroid]]", "[[Magical Android]]", "[[Salamangreat Zebroid X]]", and "[[Meteor Rush - Monochroid]]" are also "roid" monsters due to having "roid" in their names. However, some "roid" [[support]] cards specify Machine "roid" monsters.

  ==Playing style==
  [[File:Vehicroids Linework.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Linework of several of the "Vehicroids" in various poses]] 
  The "roid" archetype can make a [[beatdown]] focused deck. Cards like "[[Armoroid]]", "Drillroid", "Steamroid", and "[[Truckroid]]" allow for a deck that packs quite a punch. Add Equip Spells like "[[United We Stand]]" for more damage and a way to get "Truckroid" the necessary power to apply its effect. Add "[[Limiter Removal]]" to the mix to increase the ATK of your board even further, and "[[Power Bond]]" produces a nasty direct attacker in form of "[[Pair Cycroid]]". Such beatdown styles often include "[[Cyber Dragon]]", and use it summon "[[Chimeratech Overdragon]]". Certain "B.E.S." monsters can also be summoned easily and provide more attack power.

  The combo of "[[Ambulanceroid]]" and "[[Expressroid]]" is used in the more popular control-oriented variants. Together they allow for a double revival effect with no "Once per turn"-clause. "[[Megaroid City]]" can help filling the GY with useful targets, while making use of the fact that most of the "roids" in this variant have higher DEF than ATK. The Counter Trap "[[Emergeroid Call]]" also triggers the effect of "Ambulanceroid". "[[Mixeroid]]" can fetch both parts of the combo, as well as other members of the archetype like "Armoroid".

  Control "roids" suffer from low ATK stats. However, "Megaroid City" switches Base-ATK with Base-DEF, which allows you to hit the opponent for 1800 ATK directly with "Submarineroid". The combo with "Ambulanceroid" and "Expressroid" gives you the necessary resources to go into "Pair Cycroid", which is the main tool to go into "[[Super Vehicroid - Mobile Base]]". 

  "roids" even have their own OTK available: "[[Ambulanceroid]]", "[[Rescueroid]]", "[[Decoyroid]]", "[[Cyber Summon Blaster]]", and any card that stops you from taking battle damage for one turn while still allowing your opponent to take effect damage, like "[[Spirit Barrier]]", will lead to an OTK in the battle phase. Ram "Decoyroid" into the opponent's monster, "Decoyroid" is destroyed, "Rescueroids" effect is triggered, giving "Decoyroid" back to the hand, which results in "Ambulanceroids" effect summoning "Decoyroid" directly to the board and "Cyber Summon Blaster" dealing 300 damage to your opponent and starting the cycle again. However, this is highly inconsistent and more of a gimmick than anything else. 

  "roids" profit from a number of Fusion support cards. A monster summoned with "[[Chain Material]]" and "Vehicroid Connection Zone" will survive the effect of Chain Material. With "[[Future Fusion]]" you can choose a "[[Barbaroid, the Ultimate Battle Machine]]" in your Extra Deck to ditch five "roids" from your Deck to the GY, creating setup for other cards in the deck. "[[Fusion Substitute]]" is a better choice than the normal "[[Polymerization]]", since all the material necessary for "Mobile Base" is probably on the board anyway, while the used "Pair Cycroid" can be shuffled back into the Extra Deck for card draw. 

  "Mixeroid" can banish Machine monsters from the Graveyard to Special Summon any "roid" Extra Deck monster, regardless of Summoning conditions. For 5 monsters, "Pair Cycroid" is allowed to perform a direct attack, for 8 "Super Vehicroid Jumbo Drill" has piercing damage, for 9 "[[Super Vehicroid - Stealth Union]]" can snatch a monster of the opponent's field and clear the board of small monsters. "Elemental HERO Necroid Shaman" for 6 can destroy a monster on the opponents side of the field and replace it with a low-stat combo starter in ATK mode instead.

  "[[That Grass Looks Greener]]" could be used in 60-card "roids" to set up "Mixeroid", but is currently banned in the TCG. "[[Card Destruction]]" is another option and can ditch "Emergeroid Call" for its GY-effect. A very small "Lightsworn" engine can be opted for, consisting of nothing more than "[[Charge of the Light Brigade]]" and "[[Raiden, Hand of the Lightsworn]]", just keep in mind that "Raiden" will eat up your Normal Summon and will not contribute to any further plays in the GY since he is a Warrior.

  "[[Iron Draw]]" is a stable choice for the deck, since "Gold Gadget" or "Silver Gadget" will trigger the requirements instantly if another monster is in hand. "[[Machine Duplication]]" has multiple targets in the deck and can help with both building a stable board as well as filling the GY once the monsters were used for Link Summons. "[[Card Trooper]]" has multiple uses in the deck: It fills the GY with cards, turns into a respectable beater, is a "Machine Duplication" target, and can be destroyed for the effect of "Megaroid City" to draw a card. "[[Gear Gigant X]]" is a solid choice for an Xyz Monster and acts as a searcher, while "[[Heavy Armored Train Ironwolf]]" can turn "Armoroid" or a stat-flipped "Mobile Base" into a massive direct attacker.

  While they generally occupy their own kind of deck separate from the greater "roid" archetype, some "[[Speedroid]]" cards qualify for inclusion into the deck as much as any other Machine "roid" monster. However, certain "roid" cards can cripple your plays if you're not careful. "Mixeroid" cannot search any "Speedroid" monster, since it can only choose non-WIND monsters, disqualifying every "Speedroid" in existence. "Megaroid City" locks the player into the usage of Fusion Monsters, therefore disallowing any Synchros you might have used during that turn. "[[Speedroid Menko]]" is indispensable for stall plays and can easily be brought back to the hand via various "roid" effects. The "[[Speedroid Terrortop]]" and "[[Speedroid Taketomborg]]" combo works as much in this deck as in any other, plus both can be ditched from the deck via "Megaroid City" if necessary. If you opt for Synchro Summoning, "[[Speedroid Red-Eyed Dice]]" is a welcome addition for its level manipulation and being a Tuner.

  Another variant of the "roid" deck is one built entirely around "[[Meteor Rush - Monochroid]]". This variant generally uses very little "roid" cards however, aside from "Monochroid" itself and "[[UFOroid]]" (and thus optionally "[[Mixeroid]]"), instead being a blind second OTK deck utilizing board breakers and [[Card Tips:Meteor Rush - Monochroid|specific floaters]].

  ===Weaknesses===
  * A major weakness of "roids" is found in their own archetype:
  ** "roid" Decks tend to be very unbalanced and lack a regular easy-to-summon beatstick. The single-tribute cards ("UFOroid" and "[[Rescueroid]]") are no stronger than the low-level monsters– never exceeding 1600 ATK. Plus, while most "roid" Monsters feature unique and technical special effects the majority of its monsters (even the bosses of the archetype) have painfully low battle stats which fail to back up their abilities. More modern archetypes tend to operate much faster and produce stronger monsters early in the game and therefore simply outpace "roid" Decks.
  ** The difficulty in summoning "roid" monsters grows at a much faster rate than other archetypes. While it is typical that the more powerful the monster the more requirements it will have, for "roid" monsters, this factor is much more extreme. The [[Fusion Monster]]s which formed the original focus of the archetype tend to have decadent summoning requirements; all require a large number of very specific materials to summon, yet provide only average levels of power.
  ** Many "roid" support cards feature very strange and specific [[activation condition]]s and tend to be fairly inflexible in their use. 
  ** Perhaps the most jarring weakness of "roid" decks is their relative predictability. Most "roid" decks take advantage of only a few key "roid" monsters to adjust deck consistency, namely "[[Expressroid]]" and "[[Ambulanceroid]]." These monsters tend to be extremely vulnerable, so an opposing player should aim to prevent these monsters from having the chance to trigger their effects. Also, since the [[Main Deck]] monsters are generally unfit for battle, the player will rely on the [[Extra Deck]] to provide the most powerful monsters. 
  * Common Anti-[[Special Summon]] effects (such as "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]" or most "[[Shaddoll]]" Fusion cards) can make short work of "roid" decks with little effort.
  * Due to their costly summons, any form of Summon negation can be deadly against a "roid" player, who cannot consistenly recover from the suffered resource loss.
