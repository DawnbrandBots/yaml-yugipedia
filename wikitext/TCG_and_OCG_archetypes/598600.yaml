  "'''Tenyi'''" ({{Ruby|天|てん}}{{Ruby|威|い}} ''Ten'i'') is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Rising Rampage]]'', made up of [[Wyrm]] monsters with various [[Attribute]]s and centered around [[Non-Effect Monster]]s.

  ===''V-Jump''===
  The storyline presented below was published in the May 2019 edition of the ''V-Jump'' magazine, featured alongside the announcement of the first "Tenyi" cards.<ref>https://ygorganization.com/dontloseyourtianwei/</ref>
  <blockquote>
  ;''Chi Gathering at Lands of Dragon Vein = "Tenyi Spirit"''
  ''The manifested form taken by chi gathering at lands of dragon veins is known as a "Tenyi Spirit". Their appearances differ depending on the nature of the "chi". Practitioners of martial arts borrowing this power for their techniques are known as the "Tenyi Style".''
  ;''[[Monk of the Tenyi]]''
  ''A young boy who is aiming to master the art of "[[Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi|Flawless Perfection]]", the secret art of Tenyi Style. He is visiting the dragon veins around the world with "Shaman" to continue his training.''
  ;''[[Shaman of the Tenyi]]''
  ''An expert at manifesting the chi gathering at dragon veins. She is guiding "Monk" on his trip visiting the dragon veins as his senior.''
  ;''[[Berserker of the Tenyi]]''
  ''The current head of Tenyi Style. He gathered too much of the chi of "[[Tenyi Spirit - Vishuda]]" within himself and turned into "Berserker".''
  ;''Two Disciples Stand Against Their Ambitious Master Who Has Lost His Way!!''
  ''Natural energy known as "chi" flows around the world. Someone once described that flow as a dragon, and named it "dragon vein", and areas fertilized by it "land of dragon veins". One day, a sudden incident struck the "Tenyi Style" master and students, who have been training day in and out to master their art through drawing out chi from the land of dragon veins. [[Vessel for the Dragon Cycle|The master who had been training by himself within a cave became consumed with dark chi]], and it drove his ambitions into overdrive. The dark chi became one with his body, and he became "Berserker of the Tenyi". He was now going to use violence and force to advance his ambition for conquering and to achieve "[[Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi|Unrivaled Tenyi]]". His number one disciple, the unmatched genius of Tenyi Style "Shaman of the Tenyi", and the younger disciple "Monk of the Tenyi" were astonished at their master's sudden change, and tried to talk some sense into him. With his ambitions amplified to an abnormal level, the disciples of course failed to reach their master by words. To stop their master's rampage, the curtain now rises upon the battle between practitioners of Tenyi Style!!''

  ===''Master Duel''===
  {{Main|Master Duel card storylines#Land of Tenyi}}
  A second storyline featuring the "Tenyi" cards is present in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel]]'' video-game. Although similar in some aspects to the previously published storyline, others are notably different. One such difference is about "Berserker of the Tenyi", who in this version is a banished master of "Tenyi", and only encounters "Monk" and "Shaman" for the first time in combat.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  "Tenyi" ({{Ruby|天|てん}}{{Ruby|威|い}} ''Ten'i'') is the Japanese transcription of the Chinese term ''tiānwēi'' (天威, lit. "heavenly might").
  The "Tenyi Spirit" monsters are each named after one of the [[wikipedia:Chakra#The seven chakra system|seven chakras]] used in a variety of [[wikipedia:Tantra#Practices|Tantric practices]] from [[wikipedia:Buddhism|Buddhism]] and [[wikipedia:Hinduism|Hinduism]].

  ==Playing style==
  The "Tenyi" archetype focuses on interactions with [[non-Effect Monster]]s (primarily [[Link Monster]]s, but also [[Token]]s), with many of their cards having effects that can only be used when the player controls a non-Effect Monster.

  All "Tenyi" Main Deck monsters have two effects: first, they can Special Summon themselves from the hand if the player controls no Effect Monsters. The second effect requires the player to control a non-Effect Monster to be activated and, by banishing themselves from the hand or Graveyard, provide searching, recovery, or disruption. Their individual effects are as follows:
  {| class="wikitable sortable"
  |-
  ! Tenyi !! Attribute !! Level !! Effect

  | [[Tenyi Spirit - Adhara|Adhara]]
  | {{Attribute|EARTH|size=24}}

  | Add 1 banished Wyrm monster to the hand.

  | [[Tenyi Spirit - Shthana|Shthana]]
  | {{Attribute|WATER|size=24}}

  |}
  So far, the archetype has five Link Monsters with top- and/or bottom-pointing [[Link Arrow]]s, two of which are non-Effect monsters: the Link-1 "[[Monk of the Tenyi]]", and the Link-3 "[[Berserker of the Tenyi]]"; "Monk" is the go-to option after using the self-Special Summoning effect of the Main Deck monsters and enables their second effects to be used; its weak stats encourage the player to use it as a ladder for more powerful Link Monsters, such as "Berserker", that is better for holding the field with its higher ATK.

  There are also 3 Effect Link Monsters:
  * The Link-2 "[[Shaman of the Tenyi]]" can be used to revive any Wyrm monster, enabling plays with Main Deck Wyrm monsters and allowing a Link climb into bigger "Tenyi" Link monsters. Its discard cost also sets up the Graveyard with "Tenyi" monsters in the process. It can also destroy an opposing card when a non-Effect monster battles, adding a layer of protection/disruption to the strategy.
  * The Link-3 "[[Draco Masters of the Tenyi]]" cannot be destroyed by battle with an Effect Monster and can also destroy other effect monsters on the field, provided it is the only Effect Monster the player controls.
  * The Link-4 "[[Tenyi Spirit - Sahasrara]]" serves as the boss monster for the archetype. It has a [[Quick Effect]] that Summons a Token, which enables the effects of "Tenyi" monsters, can be used for further Link/Synchro plays, and also enables the Continuous Effect of "Sahasrara", which protects Effect Monsters on the field from being targeted by the opponent's attacks or card effects. This also affects the opponent's monsters, which can potentially disrupt the opponent's strategy since they are unable to target their own monsters with beneficial effects.

  Since "Adhara" is a Tuner, the archetype can also perform Synchro Summons. The archetypal Synchro Monster, "[[Draco Berserker of the Tenyi]]", technically has no synergy with the Deck's strategy. However, it is a very reliable beatstick that gains ATK when it destroys a monster and can even attack twice. It can also disrupt an opponent's move by banishing a monster when it activates its effect.

  "Tenyi" support cards also encourage the player to control a non-Effect Monster: "[[Vessel for the Dragon Cycle]]" can be used to search for a Link material and set up the Graveyard with "Tenyi" monsters, and "[[Flawless Perfection of the Tenyi]]" gives on-field non-Effect Monsters full immunity against monster effects, while also providing two draws if the opponent Special Summons an Effect Monster. "[[Fists of the Unrivaled Tenyi]]", the theme's Counter Trap Card, is capable of negating the activation of any Spell/Trap card or Monster effect, albeit not destroying the negated card, which makes it more effective against Spell/Traps that do not remain on the field after resolution, as well as monster effects that resolve out of the field. It has a secondary effect that activates if it is destroyed by the opponent while face-down, allowing the player to Special Summon a non-Effect monster from the Extra Deck, which can range from "[[Allvain the Essence of Vanity]]" to "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]". "[[Heavenly Dragon Circle]]" is a generic Wyrm support card, but also rewards the player for controlling a non-Effect monster and has a second effect that searches a "Tenyi" card, providing consistency to the Deck.

  "[[Swordsoul]]" cards have a strong synergy with the Deck and gives it more field presence and consistency, as the archetype focuses on summoning "[[Swordsoul Token]]". "[[Swordsoul Emergence]]" can search for "Tenyi" monsters, "[[Swordsoul Sacred Summit]]" can revive them, and "[[Swordsoul of Taia]]" can mill them. "[[Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying]]" can trigger its effect to banish 2 opposing cards if a "Tenyi" banishes itself from the Graveyard. Also, "[[Swordsoul Blackout]]" can be combined with "Shthana", that can revive the monster destroyed by "Blackout" and destroy an additional card.

  Other generic options that can synergize with the Deck include "[[Waterfall of Dragon Souls]]" and "[[White Elephant's Gift]]", synergizing with the archetype's focus on Wyrms and non-Effect Monsters to provide more resources and draw power. "[[Mare Mare]]" is a Tuner that can Special Summon up to 3 Wyrm tokens per turn, and is easily Special Summoned with "Shaman of the Tenyi", allowing advanced Link Summons or Synchro Summons.
