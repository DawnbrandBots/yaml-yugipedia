  "'''Empowered Warrior'''" ({{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|装|そう}}{{Ruby|戦|せん}}{{Ruby|士|し}} ''Masō Senshi'') is an [[archetype]] that is part of the "[[Empower]]" [[series]]. While the monsters debuted in ''[[Starter Deck 2014]]'', it was not until OCG ''[[Clash of Rebellions]]'' that they received Pendulum [[support]]. They are related to the "[[Summoner]]" series and the "[[Aether]]" archetype.
  The term "Empowered" refers to the armor pieces worn by the monsters of this archetype. "[[Arnis, the Empowered Warrior|Arnis]]", "[[Hydrotortoise, the Empowered Warrior|Hydrotortoise]]", "[[Terratiger, the Empowered Warrior|Terratiger]]" and "[[Ventdra, the Empowered Warrior|Ventdra]]" have equipment originated from "[[Aether, the Empowering Dragon]]", while both "[[Dragodies, the Empowered Warrior|Dragodies]]" and "[[Dragonox, the Empowered Warrior|Dragonox]]" are basically different forms of "Ventdra" that is equipped by the armor of "[[Aether, the Evil Empowering Dragon]]".

  ==Playing style==
  Competitively, when running "[[Terraforming]]", the "[[Empowerment]]" Field Spell Card and it's "Discard to Special Summon from Deck" effect is used for "[[Dragodies, the Empowered Warrior]]" to gain its "When Destroyed on the Field" effect.
  Both "Dragodies" and "[[Dragonox, the Empowered Warrior]]" as Pendulum Scales for their strong Battle Phase effects when using them from the Hand.  The Field effect of "Dragonox" can be useful for any Deck for great utility, but the revival target must be checked by the opponent to make sure it is a correct target: losing any surprise factor.
  "[[Aether, the Evil Empowering Dragon]]" and "[[Aether, the Empowering Dragon]]" provide the archetype with a variety of removal effects, and are searchable through the effect of "Empowerment". 
  "[[Terratiger, the Empowered Warrior]]" (When Normal Summoned) and "[[Ventdra, the Empowered Warrior]]" (When Destroyed on the Field) have utility effects for [[Normal Monster]]s and would be useful for Graveyard-style archetypes like "[[Dark Magician (archetype)|Dark Magician]]" or "[[Red-Eyes]]" with a slight Rank 4 Monster focus.
  "Dragodies" and "Empowerment" combo is similar to "[[Sky Iris]]" and "[[Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]]" in terms of speed and utility. For a little context, in the OCG, "Empowered Warrior" Pendulum cards were released around the same time as "[[Performage]]" and "[[Dracoslayer]]" (Both heavily restricted); whereas "[[Odd-Eyes]]" and "Pendulum [[Magician]]" (Some search effects restricted) cards were released around the same time as the "[[Red-Eyes]]" support in "[[Clash of Rebellions]]".
