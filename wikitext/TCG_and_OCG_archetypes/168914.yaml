  "'''Evil HERO'''" ({{Ruby|Ｅ－ＨＥＲＯ|イービルヒーロー}} ''Ībiru Hīrō'') is a sub-[[archetype]] of the "[[HERO]]" archetype used by [[Jaden Yuki]] as [[The Supreme King]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. It consists of [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They are corrupted versions of Jaden's "[[Elemental HERO]]" monsters and "[[Hero Kid]]". Most "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters are [[Fusion Summon]]ed by fusing existing "Elemental HERO" monsters with "[[Dark Fusion]]" instead of the traditional "[[Polymerization]]".

  "Evil HERO" monsters debuted in ''[[Gladiator's Assault]]'' and featured prominently ''[[Duelist Pack: Jaden Yuki 3]]'', but "Evil HERO" only received its first support in ''[[Duelist Pack: Legend Duelist 5]]'' and ''[[Legendary Duelists: Immortal Destiny]]''.

  Prior to the [[Problem-Solving Card Text]] rename to recognize "[[HERO]]" as an archetype, cards that support the "HERO" archetype in the ''OCG'' instead supported "Elemental Hero", "[[Destiny HERO|Destiny Hero]]" and "Evil Hero" as separate archetypes in the ''TCG'' ("[[Masked HERO]]" and "[[Vision HERO]]" were not released in the ''TCG'' at that time). This was despite the fact that "Evil Hero" was not an archetype at the time.

  == Origin ==
  The designs of the "Evil HERO" monsters bear some similarity to various demonic superheroes, villains, and antiheroes, such as [[wikipedia:The Darkness (comics)|The Darkness]], [[wikipedia:Hellboy|Hellboy]], and [[wikipedia:Witchblade|Witchblade]].

  The "Evil HERO" monsters appear to have allusions to Hell. Most of them have the word "Hell" in their Japanese attack/effect names, as well as fire being a prominent feature among them; any instances of "Hell" are replaced with "Infernal" in English. For example, the attack name of "Inferno Wing" is "Inferno Blast" and its effect name is "Hell Backfire", "Infernal Sniper" (whose Japanese name is "Hell Sniper") has the effect name "Hell Shot". The Japanese names of "Infernal Gainer" and "Malicious Fiend" are "Hell Gainer" and "Malicious Devil" respectively. Additionally, when "Dark Gaia" (whose background appears to be Hell) was Summoned in the anime, a big burst of lava erupted from the ground.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Evil HERO" archetype is focused on [[Fusion Summon]]ing, specifically with the Fusion [[Spell Card]] "[[Dark Fusion]]". By default, all "Evil HERO" [[Fusion Monster]]s must be Summoned with "Dark Fusion".

  Most "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters have specific material requirements, and most of them require specific "[[Elemental HERO]]" monsters. As such, an "Evil HERO" Deck is functionally also an "Elemental HERO" Deck, and shares many of the same strategies aside from the additional requirement to search out "Dark Fusion". However, "[[Evil HERO Malicious Fiend]]", "[[Evil HERO Malicious Bane|Malicious Bane]]", and "[[Evil HERO Dark Gaia|Dark Gaia]]" have more generic material requirements, allowing them to be used in more diverse Deck builds.

  The "Evil HERO" [[Main Deck]] monsters have largely supportive effects focusing on supporting the "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters. The most important member is arguably "[[Evil HERO Adusted Gold|Adusted Gold]]", who can search out "[[Dark Fusion]]" or a card that [[mentions]] it. Among these cards, "[[Dark Calling]]" is a substitute for "Dark Fusion" that can also Summon "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters but by banishing materials in the [[GY]] or hand, allowing a Fusion Summon without the need for a [[field]] setup, while "[[Supreme King's Castle]]" allows "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters to be Fusion Summoned without requiring "Dark Fusion", greatly expanding the flexibility of their Summons. This also allows them to be Summoned with "[[Super Polymerization]]", by using one of the opponent's monsters as [[Fusion Material]]. This strategy synergizes with the "Omni HERO"-style Deck that uses "Super Polymerization" to Summon monsters such as "[[Elemental HERO Absolute Zero]]", "[[Elemental HERO The Shining]]", or "[[Elemental HERO Escuridao]]" using an opponent's monster as well. The remaining Main Deck monsters are not as useful in the modern game,  though they have a minor swarming engine in the form of "[[Evil HERO Infernal Prodigy|Infernal Prodigy]]" and "[[Evil HERO Sinister Necrom|Sinister Necrom]]".

  The archetype's related [[Link Monster]], "[[Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer]]", compliments the playstyle of Decks that run the "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters that require specific materials by being able to search the materials from the Deck while also providing an ATK gain to Fiend monsters such as "Evil HERO" monsters. They can also make use of "[[Xtra HERO Wonder Driver]]" to help recycle their "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" or "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" Spells from the GY for reuse if needed.

  While the effects of various "Evil HERO" cards generically support Fiend monsters, "Evil HERO" decks generally do not function optimally with such monsters except those of their own archetype. Instead, the "Evil HERO" archetype greatly benefits from generic "[[HERO]]" searchers and support cards, such as "[[Elemental HERO Stratos]]", "[[Vision HERO Vyon]]", and "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]". Within a general "HERO" archetypal Deck, the only "Evil HERO" cards used are just "Adusted Gold", "Dark Calling", and "Malicious Bane". "Adusted Gold" can search for "Dark Calling", and "Dark Calling" will then [[banish]] "Adusted Gold" and another suitable generic material to Summon "Malicious Bane", providing an easy and low-cost way to bring out a strong boss monster.

  For Rock-[[Type]] monsters, "Evil HERO" Decks historically used the [[Hex-Sealed Fusion]] monsters ("[[The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion]]", "[[The Earth - Hex-Sealed Fusion]]" or "[[The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion]]"), as they were [[Fusion Substitute Monster]]s that can be used in place of named materials some of their Fusion Monsters required and "Dark Gaia". Currently however, "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" and "[[Lord of the Heavenly Prison]]" are both high-[[ATK]], high-Level, [[Rock]] [[hand trap]]s, which can be used as Fusion Materials for "Dark Gaia" or "Malicious Bane" after using their own effects. This ensures the Deck runs functional Rock-[[Type]] monsters over cards such as "[[Valkyrion the Magna Warrior]]" who have higher ATK, but have no function outside of being used as Fusion Materials for "Dark Gaia" or "Malicious Bane", making them [[brick]]s.

  == Trivia ==
  {{Multiple image|image1=EvilHERODarkGaia-GLAS-KR-SR-1E.png|caption1="Elemental HERO Dark Gaia"|image2=EvilHERODarkGaia-GLAS-KR-SR-UE-Reprint.png|caption2="Evil HERO Dark Gaia"}}
  * In the Korean version of ''[[Gladiator's Assault]]'', the "Evil HERO" monsters used "Elemental HERO" (엘리멘틀 히어로) in their names instead of "Evil HERO" (이블 히어로). This occurred in both [[1st Edition]] and [[Unlimited Edition]] prints, but was corrected in later Unlimited Edition prints. Subsequent sets used the correct names for "Evil HEROes" in Korean.
  * The way the Japanese name of the archetype is written (Ｅ－ＨＥＲＯ) is a reference to the Elemental HERO archetype (Ｅ・ＨＥＲＯ). This makes the two archetypes the only two HERO subarchetypes used in the anime to share an abbreviated letter in their Japanese name.
