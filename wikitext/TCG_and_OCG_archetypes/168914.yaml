  "'''Evil HERO'''" ({{Ruby|Ｅ－ＨＥＲＯ|イービルヒーロー}} ''Ībiru Hīrō'') is a sub-[[archetype]] of the "[[HERO]]" archetype used by [[Jaden Yuki]] as [[The Supreme King]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. It consists almost entirely of [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They are corrupted versions of Jaden's "[[Elemental HERO]]" monsters and "[[Hero Kid]]". Most "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters are [[Fusion Summon]]ed by fusing existing "Elemental HERO" monsters with "[[Dark Fusion]]" instead of the traditional "[[Polymerization]]".

  "Evil HERO" monsters debuted in ''[[Gladiator's Assault]]'' and featured prominently ''[[Duelist Pack: Jaden Yuki 3]]'', but "Evil HERO" only received its first support in ''[[Duelist Pack: Legend Duelist 5]]'' and ''[[Legendary Duelists: Immortal Destiny]]''.

  Prior to the [[Problem-Solving Card Text]] rename to recognize "[[HERO]]" as an archetype, cards that support the "HERO" archetype in the ''OCG'' instead supported "Elemental Hero", "[[Destiny HERO|Destiny Hero]]" and "Evil Hero" as separate archetypes in the ''TCG'' ("[[Masked HERO]]" and "[[Vision HERO]]" were not released in the ''TCG'' at that time). This was despite the fact that "Evil Hero" was not an archetype at the time.

  == Origin ==
  The designs of the "Evil HERO" monsters bear some similarity to various demonic superheroes, villains, and antiheroes, such as [[wikipedia:The Darkness (comics)|The Darkness]], [[wikipedia:Hellboy|Hellboy]], and [[wikipedia:Witchblade|Witchblade]].

  The "Evil HERO" monsters appear to have allusions to Hell. Most of them have the word "Hell" in their Japanese attack/effect names, as well as fire being a prominent feature among them; any instances of "Hell" are replaced with "Infernal" in English. For example, the attack name of "Inferno Wing" is "Inferno Blast" and its effect name is "Hell Backfire", "Infernal Sniper" (whose Japanese name is "Hell Sniper") has the effect name "Hell Shot". The Japanese names of "Infernal Gainer" and "Malicious Fiend" are "Hell Gainer" and "Malicious Devil" respectively. Additionally, when "Dark Gaia" (whose background appears to be Hell) was Summoned in the anime, a big burst of lava erupted from the ground.

  == Playing style ==
  As with "[[HERO]]" and its other sub-archetypes, the "Evil HERO" archetype is focused on [[Fusion Summon]]ing, specifically with the Fusion [[Spell Card]] "[[Dark Fusion]]". By default, all "Evil HERO" [[Fusion Monster]]s must be Summoned with "Dark Fusion".

  The "Evil HERO" [[Main Deck]] monsters have effects mainly focusing on supporting "Dark Fusion" and/or the "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters. They can facilitate a swarming engine; "[[Evil HERO Infernal Prodigy|Infernal Prodigy]]" is a useful starter and "[[Evil HERO Sinister Necrom|Sinister Necrom]]" can Special Summon an "Evil HERO" monster from the Deck by banishing itself from the GY, while "[[Evil HERO Toxic Bubble|Toxic Bubble]]" and "[[Evil HERO Doom Prison|Doom Prison]]" are useful extenders that can Special Summon themselves from the hand (the latter requires controlling a Fusion Monster that must be Special Summoned with "Dark Fusion"). The most important member is arguably "[[Evil HERO Adusted Gold|Adusted Gold]]", who can search out "Dark Fusion" or a card that [[mentions]] it.  

  The theme's Spells/[[Trap Card|Traps]] that mention "Dark Fusion" include:
  * "[[Dark Calling]]" is a substitute for "Dark Fusion" which can Fusion Summon "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters by [[banish]]ing materials from the [[GY]] or hand, allowing a Fusion Summon without the need for a [[field]] setup.
  * "[[Supreme King's Castle]]" allows "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters to be Fusion Summoned by card effects other than "Dark Fusion", greatly expanding the flexibility of their Summons. This also allows them to be Summoned with "[[Super Polymerization]]" (which can be [[Set]] from the Deck by "[[Evil HERO Infernal Rider|Infernal Rider]]") by using an opponent's monster(s) as Fusion Material. This strategy synergizes with the "Omni-HERO"-style Deck that uses "Super Polymerization" to Summon monsters such as "[[Elemental HERO Absolute Zero]]", "[[Elemental HERO The Shining]]", or "[[Elemental HERO Escuridao]]".
  * "[[Evil Mind]]" can allow the user to draw 1 card, add "Dark Fusion", a "[[HERO]]" monster or a "Fusion"/"Polymerization" Spell, though the choice of the effects depend on the number of monsters in the opponent's GY.
  * "[[Dark Contact]]" can also Fusion Summon "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters, but by shuffling the materials from the field, GY or banishment into the Deck. Alternatively, it can search "Dark Fusion" or "Supreme King's Castle".
  * "[[Evil Assault]]" can search or Special Summon a Level 4 or lower "Evil HERO" monster from the Deck, then recover a "Dark Fusion" from the GY in a later turn.
  * "[[Dark Supremacy]]" is a Trap which negate the effects of face-up cards on the field, then shuffle "HERO" monsters from the GY or banishment into the Deck in a later turn.

  While the effects of various "Evil HERO" cards generically support Fiend monsters, "Evil HERO" decks generally do not function optimally with non-"HERO" Fiend monsters as various "Evil HERO" cards restrict the player from Special Summoning non-"HERO" monsters. As such, "Evil HERO" greatly benefits from generic "HERO" searchers and support cards, such as "[[Elemental HERO Stratos]]", "[[Vision HERO Vyon]]" (along with "[[Vision HERO Faris]]" and "[[Vision HERO Increase]]"), and "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]". By utilizing the swarming capabilities of the "HERO" archetype as well as their own cards, "Evil HERO" decks use their multiple "HERO" monsters on the field to [[Link Summon]] the [[Xtra HERO]] [[Link Monster]]s, which then sets up the GY for the monsters' effects or for a Fusion Summon with "Dark Calling" or "Dark Contact". In particular, "[[Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer]]" compliments the playstyle of Decks that run the "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters that require specific materials by being able to search the materials from the Deck while also providing an ATK gain to Fiend monsters such as "Evil HERO" monsters. Meanwhile, "[[Xtra HERO Wonder Driver]]" can recycle the deck's "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" or "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" Spells from the GY for reuse if needed. If "[[Destiny HERO]]" monsters such as "[[Destiny HERO - Malicious|Malicious]]" are ran, "Evil HERO" can also use "[[Xtra HERO Cross Crusader]]" for another "HERO" search, as well as more [[Link Material]]s provided by "Malicious". 

  Within a general "HERO" archetypal Deck, the only "Evil HERO" cards used are just "Adusted Gold", "Dark Calling", and "Malicious Bane". "Adusted Gold" can search for "Dark Calling", and "Dark Calling" will then [[banish]] "Adusted Gold" and another suitable generic material to Summon "Malicious Bane", providing an easy and low-cost way to bring out a strong boss monster.

  For [[Rock]]-[[Type]] monsters, "Evil HERO" Decks historically used the [[Hex-Sealed Fusion]] monsters ("[[The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion]]", "[[The Earth - Hex-Sealed Fusion]]" or "[[The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion]]"), as they were [[Fusion Substitute Monster]]s that can be used in place of named materials some of their Fusion Monsters required and "Dark Gaia". Currently, these cards have been made almost obsolete with the introduction of "Doom Prison". Other useful Rock options options are "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" and "[[Lord of the Heavenly Prison]]"; they are both high-[[ATK]], high-Level [[hand trap]]s, which can be used as Fusion Materials for "Dark Gaia", "Malicious Bane" and "Neos Lord" after using their own effects. This ensures the Deck runs functional Rock-[[Type]] monsters over cards such as "[[Valkyrion the Magna Warrior]]" who have higher ATK, but have no function outside of being used as Fusion Materials for "Dark Gaia" or "Malicious Bane", making them [[brick]]s.

  == Trivia ==
  {{Multiple image|image1=EvilHERODarkGaia-GLAS-KR-SR-1E.png|caption1="Elemental HERO Dark Gaia"|image2=EvilHERODarkGaia-GLAS-KR-SR-UE-Reprint.png|caption2="Evil HERO Dark Gaia"}}
  * In the Korean version of ''[[Gladiator's Assault]]'', the "Evil HERO" monsters used "Elemental HERO" (엘리멘틀 히어로) in their names instead of "Evil HERO" (이블 히어로). This occurred in both [[1st Edition]] and [[Unlimited Edition]] prints, but was corrected in later Unlimited Edition prints. Subsequent sets used the correct names for "Evil HEROes" in Korean.
  * The way the Japanese name of the archetype is written (Ｅ－ＨＥＲＯ) is a reference to the Elemental HERO archetype (Ｅ・ＨＥＲＯ). This makes the two archetypes the only two HERO subarchetypes used in the anime to share an abbreviated letter in their Japanese name.
