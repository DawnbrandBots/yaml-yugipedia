  "'''Evil HERO'''" ({{Ruby|Ｅ－ＨＥＲＯ|イービルヒーロー}} ''Ībiru Hīrō'') is a sub-[[archetype]] of the "[[HERO]]" archetype used by [[Jaden Yuki]] as [[The Supreme King]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. It consists almost entirely of [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They are [[counterpart|corrupted versions]] of Jaden's "[[Elemental HERO]]" monsters and "[[Hero Kid]]". Most "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters are [[Fusion Summon]]ed by fusing existing "Elemental HERO" monsters with "[[Dark Fusion]]" instead of the traditional "[[Polymerization]]".

  "Evil HERO" monsters debuted in ''[[Gladiator's Assault]]'' and featured prominently ''[[Duelist Pack: Jaden Yuki 3]]'', but "Evil HERO" only received its first support in ''[[Duelist Pack: Legend Duelist 5]]'' and ''[[Legendary Duelists: Immortal Destiny]]''.

  Prior to the [[Problem-Solving Card Text]] rename to recognize "[[HERO]]" as an archetype, cards that support the "HERO" archetype in the ''OCG'' instead supported "Elemental Hero", "[[Destiny HERO|Destiny Hero]]" and "Evil Hero" as separate archetypes in the ''TCG'' ("[[Masked HERO]]" and "[[Vision HERO]]" were not released in the ''TCG'' at that time). This was despite the fact that "Evil Hero" was not a supported archetype at the time.

  == Origin ==
  The designs of the "Evil HERO" monsters bear some similarity to various demonic superheroes, villains, and antiheroes, such as [[wikipedia:The Darkness (comics)|The Darkness]], [[wikipedia:Hellboy|Hellboy]], and [[wikipedia:Witchblade|Witchblade]].

  The "Evil HERO" monsters appear to have allusions to Hell. Most of them have the word "Hell" in their Japanese attack/effect names, as well as fire being a prominent feature among them; any instances of "Hell" are replaced with "Infernal" in English. For example, the attack name of "Inferno Wing" is "Inferno Blast" and its effect name is "Hell Backfire", "Infernal Sniper" (whose Japanese name is "Hell Sniper") has the effect name "Hell Shot". The Japanese names of "Infernal Gainer" and "Malicious Fiend" are "Hell Gainer" and "Malicious Devil" respectively. Additionally, when "Dark Gaia" (whose background appears to be Hell) was Summoned in the anime, a big burst of lava erupted from the ground.

  == Playing style ==
  As with "[[HERO]]" and its other sub-archetypes, the "Evil HERO" archetype is focused on [[Fusion Summon]]ing, specifically with the Fusion [[Spell Card]] "[[Dark Fusion]]". By default, all "Evil HERO" [[Fusion Monster]]s must be Summoned with "Dark Fusion". The sub-archetype as a whole aims to set conditions to brute force a devastating offense against the opponent with effects such as field-wide monster destruction and prevention of Spell/Trap activations, in addition to tools to assist themselves and the larger "HERO" archetype when going first or playing the long game.

  The "Evil HERO" [[Main Deck]] monsters have effects mainly focusing on supporting "Dark Fusion" and/or the "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters. Some of them can facilitate a swarming engine; "[[Evil HERO Infernal Prodigy|Infernal Prodigy]]" is a useful starter and "[[Evil HERO Sinister Necrom|Sinister Necrom]]" can Special Summon an "Evil HERO" monster from the Deck by banishing itself from the GY, while "[[Evil HERO Toxic Bubble|Toxic Bubble]]", "[[Evil HERO Dead-End Prison|Dead-End Prison]]" and "[[Evil HERO Vicious Claws|Vicious Claws]]" are useful extenders that can Special Summon themselves from the hand (the latter two requires controlling a Fusion Monster that must be Special Summoned with "Dark Fusion" or a "HERO" monster) in addition to vital bonus effects such as a double draw or simultaneous "[[Foolish Burial]]" for "HERO" monsters, [[Fusion Substitute Monster|Fusion substitution]] or a self-revival. The most important member is arguably "[[Evil HERO Adusted Gold|Adusted Gold]]", who can search out "Dark Fusion" or a card that [[mentions]] it. 

  Finally, "[[Evil HERO Infernal Rider]] " can add "Dark Fusion" from the Deck or GY upon its Normal or Special Summon, but can also [[Set]] "[[Super Polymerization]]" from the Deck and temporarily allow "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters to be Fusion Summoned with effects other than "Dark Fusion". This includes "[[Polymerization]]" that "HERO" decks can easily search. That set "Super Polymerization" now acts as a piece of disruption which Fusion Summons a suitable "HERO" Fusion Monster using a monster from the opponent's field as material with "Super Polymerization", whether it is one of the "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters, or one of the "Omni-[[Elemental HERO]]" Fusion Monsters (which mentions an "Elemental HERO" monster and 1 monster of their [[Attribute]] as material such as "[[Elemental HERO Absolute Zero]]", "[[Elemental HERO The Shining]]", or "[[Elemental HERO Escuridao]]"). Its high Level of 6 also makes it an applicable secondary material for "[[Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer]]" when used in the de facto "omni-HERO" Deck build.

  The theme's Spells/[[Trap Card|Traps]] that mention "Dark Fusion" include:
  * "[[Dark Calling]]" is a substitute for "Dark Fusion" which can Fusion Summon "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters by [[banish]]ing materials from the [[GY]] or hand, allowing a Fusion Summon without the need for a [[field]] setup.
  * "[[Supreme King's Castle]]" allows "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters to be Fusion Summoned by card effects other than "Dark Fusion" similar to "Infernal Rider" albeit as a (permanent) [[Continuous Effect]] while face-up on the field. It can also temporarily grant an ATK boost to a Fiend monster that is battling an opponent's monster by sending an "Evil HERO" monster from the Deck or Extra Deck to the GY.
  * "[[Evil Mind]]" can allow the user to draw 1 card, add "Dark Fusion", a "HERO" monster or a "Fusion"/"Polymerization" Spell, though the effect that can be chosen depends on the number of monsters in the opponent's GY.
  * "[[Dark Contact]]" can also Fusion Summon "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters, but by shuffling the materials from the field, GY or banishment into the Deck. Alternatively, it can search "Dark Fusion" or "Supreme King's Castle".
  * "[[Evil Assault]]" can search or Special Summon a Level 4 or lower "Evil HERO" monster from the Deck, then recover a "Dark Fusion" from the GY in a later turn.
  * "[[Dark Supremacy]]" is a Trap which negate the effects of face-up cards on the field (scaling with "Dark Fusion" and Spells mentioning it in GY), then shuffle "HERO" monsters from the GY or banishment into the Deck in a later turn.

  While the effects of various "Evil HERO" cards generically support Fiend monsters, "Evil HERO" decks generally do not function optimally with non-"HERO" Fiend monsters as various "Evil HERO" cards restrict the player from Special Summoning non-"HERO" monsters. As such, "Evil HERO" greatly benefits from generic "HERO" and "[[Polymerization]]" searchers and support cards, such as "[[Elemental HERO Stratos]]", "[[Vision HERO Vyon]]" (along with "[[Vision HERO Faris]]" and "[[Vision HERO Increase]]"), and "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]". By utilizing the swarming capabilities of the "HERO" archetype as well as their own cards, "Evil HERO" decks use their multiple "HERO" monsters on the field to [[Link Summon]] the [[Xtra HERO]] [[Link Monster]]s, which then sets up the GY for the monsters' effects or for a Fusion Summon with "Dark Calling" or "Dark Contact". In particular, "[[Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer]]" compliments the playstyle of Decks that run the "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters that require specific materials by being able to search the materials from the Deck while also providing an ATK gain to Fiend monsters such as "Evil HERO" monsters. Meanwhile, "[[Xtra HERO Wonder Driver]]" can recycle the deck's "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" or "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" Spells from the GY for reuse if needed. If "[[Destiny HERO]]" monsters such as "[[Destiny HERO - Malicious|Malicious]]" are ran, "Evil HERO" can also use "[[Xtra HERO Cross Crusader]]" for another "HERO" search, more Fusion or [[Link Material]]s provided by "Malicious", and can utilize "[[Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer]]" which can be used to setup for the GY effect of "Evil HERO Vicious Claws" for another revival and destroying yet another card. 

  Within a general "HERO" archetypal Deck, "Evil HERO" assists in both providing additional bodies for their generic Fusion and Link Summons. "Adusted Gold" can be easily searched by "Elemental HERO Shadow Mist" or "Xtra HERO Cross Crusader", and it can search "Dark Calling" or "Dark Contact" to enable the use of "Malicious Bane" as a board cleaner; "Dark Contact" is also useful to shuffle a copy of "Destiny HERO - Malicious" into the Deck to be Summoned via its own effect an additional time that turn. "Evil Assault" can also be useful to quickly Special Summon "Dead-End Prison" as an additional way to send key "HERO" monsters to the GY. "Toxic Bubble" can be useful as a free Special Summon for Link plays even if the player doesn't plan to use its draw effect. Finally, after a player Summons "[[Elemental HERO Shining Neos Wingman]]" via "[[Favorite Contact]]" to disrupt the opponent's field, a "Super Polymerization" Set by "Infernal Rider" can offer further disruption by using "Shining Neos Wingman" and an opponent's monster as material to Summon "Neos Lord" and take control of another opponent's monster.

  For [[Rock]]-[[Type]] monsters, "Evil HERO" Decks historically used the [[Hex-Sealed Fusion]] monsters ("[[The Dark - Hex-Sealed Fusion]]", "[[The Earth - Hex-Sealed Fusion]]" or "[[The Light - Hex-Sealed Fusion]]"), as they were [[Fusion Substitute Monster]]s that can be used in place of named materials some of their Fusion Monsters required and "Dark Gaia". Currently, these cards have been made almost obsolete with the introduction of "Dead-End Prison". Other useful Rock options options are "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" and "[[Lord of the Heavenly Prison]]"; they are both high-[[ATK]], high-Level [[hand trap]]s, which can be used as Fusion Materials for "Dark Gaia", "Malicious Bane" or "Neos Lord" after using their own effects. This ensures the Deck runs functional Rock-[[Type]] monsters over cards such as "[[Valkyrion the Magna Warrior]]" who have higher ATK, but have no function outside of being used as Fusion Materials for the aforementioned, making them [[brick]]s.

  Due to "[[Evil HERO Adusted Gold]]" being a [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] monster, an "Evil HERO" deck can benefit off playing the "[[Fiendsmith]]" package of cards.

  == Trivia ==
  {{Multiple image|image1=EvilHERODarkGaia-GLAS-KR-SR-1E.png|caption1="Elemental HERO Dark Gaia"|image2=EvilHERODarkGaia-GLAS-KR-SR-UE-Reprint.png|caption2="Evil HERO Dark Gaia"}}
  * In the Korean version of ''[[Gladiator's Assault]]'', the "Evil HERO" monsters used "Elemental HERO" (엘리멘틀 히어로) in their names instead of "Evil HERO" (이블 히어로). This occurred in both [[1st Edition]] and [[Unlimited Edition]] prints, but was corrected in later Unlimited Edition prints. Subsequent sets used the correct names for "Evil HEROes" in Korean.
  * The written Japanese name of the archetype (Ｅ－ＨＥＲＯ) is a reference to that of the "Elemental HERO" archetype (Ｅ・ＨＥＲＯ). This makes them the only two "HERO" sub-archetypes used in the anime to share an abbreviated letter in their Japanese name.
