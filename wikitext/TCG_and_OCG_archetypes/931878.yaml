  "'''Gate Guardian'''" (ゲート・ガーディアン ''Gēto Gādian'') is a sub-[[archetype]] of the "[[Guardian]]" archetype comprised of high-[[Level]] monsters based around the original "[[Gate Guardian]]" and its three component cards-"[[Sanga of the Thunder]]", "[[Kazejin]]", and "[[Suijin]]". They were used by the [[Meikyû the Elder|Meikyû]] [[Meikyû the Younger|Brothers]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga and their anime counterparts, the [[Paradox Brothers]], [[Para]] and [[Dox]], in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime and the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. In the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'', while the original "Gate Guardian" has existed since [[Metal Raiders]], it recieved its first support in [[Maze of Memories]].

  == Anime ==
  "Gate Guardian" is formed from the combination of its three component parts—the elements of thunder, wind, and water—which is represented by the three being stacked on each other to form a new body; however, it is also capable of surviving even if one of these parts is destroyed.

  "Gate Guardian" with all three components is said to rival "[[Exodia the Forbidden One]]" in power, and according to [[Para]] and [[Dox]] was the second monster after "Exodia" created by [[Maximillion Pegasus]] to require multiple cards to be played at the same time to form.

  == Design ==
  === Members ===
  The [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] of all "Gate Guardian" monsters are equal to half the sum of that of their components (except "[[Dark Guardian]]").

  The titular "[[Gate Guardian]]" and "Dark Guardian" are [[DARK]] [[Warrior]] [[Special Summon Monster]]s with [[Special Summoning condition]]s that require "[[Sanga of the Thunder]]", "[[Kazejin]]", and "[[Suijin]]". In a number of video games, "Gate Guardian" is a [[Ritual Monster]] summoned using "[[Gate Guardian Ritual]]".

  The other "Gate Guardian" monsters are [[Fusion Monster]]s that require a combination of "Sanga of the Thunder", "Kazejin", and/or "Suijin" as [[Fusion Material]]s.

  == Playing style ==
  "Gate Guardian" focuses on placing the three parts of the titular monster into your hand or onto the field as [[Continuous Spell Card]]s, then using them to form [[Contact Fusion]]s. With the exception of "Gate Guardians Combined", they each require banishing 2 cards from your field:
  * "[[Gate Guardian of Wind and Water|Wind and Water]]" can negate Spells/Traps up to twice per turn.
  * "[[Gate Guardian of Thunder and Wind|Thunder and Wind]]" can search a related Spell/Trap once per turn.
  * "[[Gate Guardian of Water and Thunder|Water and Thunder]]" can change an opponent's monster ATK to 0 up to twice per turn.
  * "[[Gate Guardians Combined]]" is formed with all three pieces, and unlike the other fusions, can be fused using cards from hand, field, and/or GY. It can negate opposing cards that target cards you control up to thrice per turn.

  Each of the "Gate Guardian" Fusions also Summons another monster if they leave the field through an opponent's card effect, making them hard to attack through. "Gate Guardians Combined" can Summon any Level 11 or lower "Gate Guardian" monster from Deck or Extra Deck (ignoring its Summoning conditions), while each of the 2-piece fusions can Summon one of their own materials.

  The key consistency tools are "[[Labyrinth Heavy Tank]]" and "[[Labyrinth Wall Shadow]]", which place the pieces from hand/Deck/banishment as Continuous Spells, and "[[Shadow Ghoul of the Labyrinth]]" which searches "Labyrinth Wall Shadow". "[[Double Attack! Wind and Thunder!!]]" and "[[Prey of the Jirai Gumo]]" are disruptions searchable by "Thunder and Wind", and both can banish themselves from the GY to add a piece from Deck/banishment to hand.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * The three Gate Guardian pieces ("[[Kazejin]]", "[[Sanga of the Thunder]]", "[[Suijin]]") are bricks unless you can form "Gate Guardians Combined".
  * As a pure archetype, the endboards are quite lackluster. It can be combined with other engines, but that leaves little space for non-engine.
