  "'''Fire King'''" ({{Ruby|炎|えん}}{{Ruby|王|おう}} ''En'ō'') is an [[archetype]] consisting mainly of [[FIRE]] [[Beast]], [[Beast-Warrior]], and [[Winged Beast]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that are mainly focused on self-destruction. They were first introduced in the ''[[OCG]]'' in ''[[Structure Deck: Onslaught of the Fire Kings]]'' and ''[[TCG]]'' in ''[[Onslaught of the Fire Kings Structure Deck]]''.

  The "Fire Kings" live on a [[Fire King Island|volcanic island]] lying in the southern seas. Using their powers over the fire, they can [[Circle of the Fire Kings|reincarnate]], and grow using its powers again. When the "Fire Kings" saw their [[Fire King Sanctuary|temple]] [[Phantasm Spiral Assault|threatened]] by the "[[Atlantean]]" army, they [[High Tide on Fire Island|fought back]] in equal strength, only enough to keep the invaders away from their island.

  == Design ==
  The "Fire King" monsters are based on deities from different cultures, mostly from South, East, and Southeast Asia, with most of its members being inspired in [[wikipedia:Hindu deities|Hindu gods]]. The archetype's general mechanic of destroying its own monsters and Special Summoning them upon each other's destruction also reference practices, beliefs and concepts that are typical to Hinduism and [[wikipedia:Buddhism|Buddhism]] and their cosmologies, such as death, reincarnation, and [[wikipedia:Self-immolation|self-immolation]].

  == Playing style ==
  The "Fire King" archetype revolves around destroying friendly monsters in the hand or field to make plays and set up the Graveyard recursion of its Main Deck boss monsters, "[[Fire King High Avatar Garunix]]" and "[[Sacred Fire King Garunix]]".

  In terms of shared effects, most "Fire King Avatar" monsters can Special Summon themselves from the hand if a "Fire King" monster is destroyed while face up on the field. Many "Fire King" cards destroy FIRE or "Fire King" monsters from the hand or field while performing another action; major ones include "[[Fire King Island]]" (destroy and search), "[[Fire King Avatar Rangbali|Rangbali]]", and "[[Fire King Avatar Arvata|Arvata]]" (destroy and [[negate]] effects).

  To compensate for the self-destruction, some "Fire King" monsters recover advantage immediately after being destroyed by the player's effects, namely "[[Fire King High Avatar Kirin|High Avatar Kirin]]" (revive a "Fire King" and destroy 1 card) and "[[Fire King Avatar Arvata|Arvata]]" (revive a monster but destroy it in the End Phase). Others recover advantage with a delay, their Trigger Effects being activated in the next Standby Phase after they're destroyed, namely "[[Fire King Avatar Barong|Barong]]" (search 1 "Fire King" card) and "[[Legendary Fire King Ponix|Legendary Ponix]]" (add itself back to hand).

  The Deck's main searchers are the monster "[[Legendary Fire King Ponix]]" and the Field Spell "[[Fire King Island]]", who can search out and enable each other's searching effect.

  The major sources of post-destruction recursion are "[[Fire King High Avatar Garunix|High Avatar Garunix]]" and "[[Sacred Fire King Garunix|Sacred Garunix]]", who can Summon themselves from the Graveyard after the player destroys them with effects, and generate lots of advantage upon doing so.
  * "High Avatar Garunix" summons itself in the next Standby Phase after it was destroyed by an effect, and destroys all other monsters on the field when doing so.
  * "Sacred Garunix" summons itself if another FIRE monster is destroyed, and can destroy a monster in the Deck when doing so; this can be used to search+destroy "Fire King" monsters that immediately generate advantage (see above; usually "High Avatar Kirin") for immmediate advantage.

  Lastly, "[[Fire King High Avatar Kirin|High Avatar Kirin]]" additionally has an in-hand effect that can destroy a FIRE monster from hand or field at Quick Effect speed, allowing the player to trigger "Sacred Garunix" on their own initiative, and even during [[Turn 0]].

  As a whole, the Deck is played with a midrange strategy, aiming to preserve and recur advantage over multiple turns to survive the opponent's attacks and out-grind the opponent. Generally, the Deck will try to tutor out "Sacred Garunix" and use its effect multiple times over multiple turns, destroying "High Avatar Kirin" from the Deck each time for massive advantage. With enough resources, additional searching/swarming power can be pivoted to "Rangbali" and "Arvata" for negates, "[[Circle of the Fire Kings]]" for revival, "[[Fire King Sky Burn]]" for removal, or Extra Deck monsters for more board presence.

  Generic support cards that may help the Deck include "[[Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys]]", "[[Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos]]", "[[True King Agnimazud, the Vanisher]]", etc. "[[Fire Formation - Tenki]]" can search the Level 4 "Fire King" monsters, and "[[Rekindling]]" can revive many of them if needed. The "[[Diabellstar]]" engine can be used to tutor out "Ponix" via "[[Original Sinful Spoils - Snake-Eye]]".
