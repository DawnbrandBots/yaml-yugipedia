  "'''Dracotail'''", known as "'''Dragontail'''" (ドラゴンテイル ''Doragonteiru'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an archetype of [[Spellcaster]] and [[Dragon]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Justice Hunters]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The theme's names are a reference to the [[wikipedia:Lunar node|lunar nodes]], the two points where the orbit of the Moon intersects the [[wikipedia:Ecliptic|ecliptic]] (Earth's own orbit). The ascending node (☊) is where the Moon moves into the northern [[wikipedia:Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic hemisphere]], and the descending node (☋) is where the Moon moves into the southern one. In medieval astronomy, the ascending node was known as the "dragon's head", while the descending node is known as the "'''dragon's tail'''", as being the only points in the sky where the Sun and the Moon can both be, they were thought responsible for them being 'devoured' during [[wikipedia:Eclipse|eclipses]].

  === Members ===
  The designs of the [[Main Deck]] "Dracotail" monsters are each based on a [[wikipedia:Constellation|constellation]] of the ecliptic plane, i.e. the [[wikipedia:Zodiac|zodiac]].

  The Spellcaster members are humanoids with dragon features, most prominently tails. They are depicted with a magic circle resembling a zodiac wheel, with their respective [[wikipedia:Astrological sign|astrological sign]] in the center. Their designs feature the astrological signs of the lunar nodes (☊ and ☋).

  The Dragon members resemble draconic, bestial versions of their respective zodiac. Their astrological sign appears in a crystal on their forehead, while the corresponding constellation is depicted in the background of their artworks.

  The [[Fusion Monster]]s are combinations of members representing pairs of zodiac signs that are opposite to each other in the sky, or 180° apart in longitude, which references how the ascending and descending node of an orbit are always 180° from each other. Their designs also prominently incorporate the aforementioned lunar node symbols.

  == Playstyle ==
  "Dracotail" is a [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]]-focused archetype that [[Fusion Summon]]ing using their monsters' effects and [[Spell Card]]s, netting advantage, then recovering their resources efficiently with their pieces of disruptions. All of their Main Deck monsters share the effect that allows them to Set 1 of their archetypal Spells/[[Trap Card|Traps]] from the Deck whenever they are sent to the GY as [[material]] for a [[Fusion Summon]] (while "[[Dracotail Pan|Pan]]", "[[Dracotail Urgula|Urgula]]" and "[[Dracotail Mululu|Mululu]]" can additionally destroy an opponent's monster, destroy an opponent's Spell/Trap, or negate the effects of an opponent's monster respectively), allowing them to generate advantage easily. "[[Dracotail Lukias|Lukias]]" can search other archetypal monsters upon Normal or Special Summon, while "[[Dracotail Phryxul|Phryxul]]" can revive any "Dracotail" monster from the GY then return one monster they control to the hand. "Pan" and "Urgula" can place themselves into the Deck from the GY to either revive a non-Fusion "Dracotail" monster (whenever a face-up Fusion Monster is destroyed by an opponent's card effect) or bring a Spellcaster "Dracotail" monster back to the hand respectively. "Mululu" on the field and "[[Dracotail Faimena|Faimena]]" in the hand have Quick Effects to perform a Fusion Summon.

  "Dracotail" Spells include: "[[Ketu Dracotail]]"; the archetype's main searcher which can additionally Fusion Summon 1 [[Dragon]] or [[Spellcaster]] Fusion Monster if the opponent controls a monster, and "[[Rahu Dracotail]]"; which allows the Fusion Summon of an archetypal Fusion Monster using monsters from the Deck, hand or field. Meanwhile, the "Dracotail" Traps can recycle a "Dracotail" card from the GY or banishment, then drawing a card after their primary effects, recovering some of the Deck's resources. "[[Dracotail Flame|Flame]]" can temporarily negate a face-up Spell's effects, "[[Dracotail Horn|Horn]]" can return any Attack Position monster to the hand/Extra Deck, and "[[Dracotail Sting|Sting]]" can banish a monster (and also a Spell/Trap, optionally) from the opponent's GY.

  The three "Dracotail" Fusion Monsters each require 1 "Dracotail" monster, and a monster(s) in the hand. They all share the effect that let them Special Summon themselves from the GY whenever 2 or more monsters are sent to the GY at the same time (but are banished when they leave the field). "[[Dracotail Gulamel|Gulamel]]" can destroy a card on the opponent's field as a Quick Effect whenever the user activates a "Dracotail" card/effect, serving as one of the archetype's main disruptions. Meanwhile, "[[Dracotail Arthalion|Arthalion]]" can return monsters from the field or GYs to the hand upon its Fusion Summon while "[[Dracotail Shaulas|Shaulas]]" can shuffle two "Dracotail" cards in the GY and one card on the field into the Deck, making them effective at removing the opponent's monsters and recurring the player's resources.

  "Dracotail" synergizes with other Spellcaster and/or Dragon Fusion-focused strategies such as "[[Branded]]/[[Despia]]", "[[Dragonmaid]]", "[[Magistus]]" and "[[Shaddoll]]". For "Shaddoll", thanks to the effect of "Faimena" which can be activated from the hand, this can allow the user to perform a Fusion Summon even during the opponent's first turn, possibly disrupting the opponent by Summoning monsters such as "[[El Shaddoll Winda]]" and proc the "Shaddoll" monster(s)' effects in the GY. Other useful Fusion Monsters that can be easily Summoned in "Dracotail" strategies include "[[Secreterion Dragon]]", which acts as another recursion tool for the Deck and passively locks down opposing Dragon or Spellcaster monsters from activating their effects. "Dracotail" Decks typically run a large amount of monsters to increase the likelihood of performing a Fusion Summon using monsters in the hand; hand traps such as the "[[Mulcharmy]]" monsters and "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" can be used as Fusion Material if their effects are not needed for the current situation.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * [[Hand Traps]]:
  ** Even if they are disrupted, Dracotail can set up their [[Trap Card|Traps]] for follow-up on the next turn. However, each of the "Dracotail" Traps has an effect to return a card from the GY to the Deck, and an effect to draw a card. This means that they are susceptible to both "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" and "[[Ghost Belle & Haunted Mansion]]", as well as "[[Dominus Purge]]".
  ** The Deck prevalently adds cards from its GY to the hand, so "[[D.D. Crow]]" can offer disruption to stop them from making more plays. Banishing "[[Dracotail Faimena]]" in particular will prevent them from [[Quick Effect]] fusing on the next turn.
  ** "[[Dimension Shifter]]" will cause their Fusion Materials to be banished, making them unable to activate their GY effects and keeping them out of reach for retrieval with "[[Dracotail Arthalion]]", even though the "Dracotail" Traps can still retrieve "Dracotail" cards from the banishment.
  ** Similarly, "[[Retaliating "C"]]", when chained to a Spell Card with a Fusion Summon effect (such as "[[Rahu Dracotail]]"), will cause all of their cards to be banished. "Faimena" can bypass this by being activated in response to the effect of "Retaliating "C"" to Fusion Summon "Arthalion" by using all monsters in hand, including a "Dracotail" monster, though this can cause "Rahu Dracotail" to resolve without effect.
  * [[Floodgate]]s:
  ** The Deck relies heavily on its Fusion Materials being sent to the GY, so any effect that would banish them instead can severely hinder their progress. Notable cards include "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]", and "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]". Similarly, cards like "[[Dark Simorgh]]" which prevents an opponent from setting cards on the field can also significantly hinder the Deck's game plan.
  ** As a Fusion-focused deck, cards like "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" can often force the Deck to pass their turn, relying only on Quick Effects that fuse on the opponent's turn in order to survive. "[[Non-Fusion Area]]" and other continuous floodgates can prevent the Deck from making relevant plays at all.
  ** Because all of the monsters in the archetype are either Dragon or Spellcaster type, "[[Secreterion Dragon]]" can prevent them from activating any of their Special Summoned monster effects. With "[[Super Polymerization]]" their own monsters can be used to make "Secreterion Dragon", but its Summon must be carefully timed, as they can easily negate its effects or destroy it using the GY effect of "[[Dracotail Mululu]]" or "[[Dracotail Pan]]" respectively. 
  * Other
  ** If a Spell is about to be negated with "[[Dracotail Flame]]", activating an effect in reponse that would sending it to the GY with "[[Forbidden Droplet]]", or targetting it with removal cards such as "[[Twin Twisters]]" and "[[Double Cyclone]]" can be used to avoid that first Spell being negated, thus preventing any part of the effect of "Flame" being negated. The aformentioned "Twin Twisters" and "Double Cyclone" can also be used to get rid of another Spell/Trap on the "Dracotail" player's field (likely another archetypal Trap), thus rendering them useless.
