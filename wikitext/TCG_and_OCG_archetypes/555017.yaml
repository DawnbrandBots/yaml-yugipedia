  "'''Topologic'''" (トポロジック ''Toporojikku'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Cyberse]] [[Link Monster]]s used by [[Roken Kogami|Roken Kogami/Varis]] and [[Pandor]]. The former acquires them through using "[[Skill|Storm Access]]", with the exception of "[[Topologic Zeroboros]]". They all notably possess a powerful [[effect]] that triggers if a monster(s) is [[Special Summon]]ed to a zone it (or another Link Monster) points to, and performs mass removal of a certain type of card.

  ==Design==
  Topologic monsters are all vaguely draconian or serpentine mechanical creatures with topologic shapes in their design, such as a mobius strip in the design of the tail of "Bomber Dragon", or the strips in the back section of "Zeroboros" being based on a trefoil knot. "[[Topologic Gumblar Dragon]]" is the main exception, but when it is Summoned to complete an [[Extra Link]] in the anime, it is formed from an infinity symbol of blue energy, and its "Infinite Destruction" effect manifests as a purple infinity symbol.

  ==Etymology==
  In mathematics, [[wikipedia:Topology|topology]] is the study of the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations; many of these shapes are present in the designs of the Topologic monsters. Their names also contain the name of a mythical reptilian creature.

  Since all members of this series are Cyberse, this series may also be a reference to [[wikipedia:Network topology|network topology]]. Network topology is the arrangement of the elements (such as links and nodes) of a communication network, which can be disrupted if one of these nodes is affected. This is a possible reference to these monster's mass removal effects, which are triggered when a monster is Special Summoned to a zone a Link Monster points to, while the Topologic monster is face-up on the field.
