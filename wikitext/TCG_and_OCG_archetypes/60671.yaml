All members are [[DARK]], [[EARTH]], or [[LIGHT]]-[[Attribute]].

  == Playing style ==
  As individual cards, "Gaia The Fierce Knight" monsters are generally easily Summonable high-Level [[beatstick]]s with some minor battle-related effects. As a singular "Gaia" Deck, the Deck is an OTK Deck focused on [[Fusion Summon]]ing "[[Gaia the Dragon Champion (archetype)|Gaia the Dragon Champion]]" monsters using "Gaia The Fierce Knight" monsters and "[[Curse of Dragon (series)|Curse of Dragon]]" monsters. The archetype has some interactions with "[[Black Luster Soldier (archetype)|Black Luster Soldier]]" monsters, but these generally do not factor into the "Gaia" Deck's focus on "Gaia the Dragon Champion".

  Rather than supporting "Curse of Dragon" monsters as a shared name string, "Gaia The Fierce Knight" and related cards instead support Level 5 Dragon Monsters in general.

  The goal of the "Gaia" Deck is to acquire the materials to Fusion Summon one or more "Gaia the Dragon Champion" monsters, preferrably using "[[Spiral Fusion]]", which gives the Fusion Summoned "Dragon Champion" a massive combat boost. To search out "Spiral Fusion", the archetype depends on "[[Curse of Dragon, the Cursed Dragon]]", who can search a Spell/Trap that mentions "Gaia the Dragon Champion" if summoned.

  The Deck's main searchers for "Gaia The Fierce Knight" and "Cursed Dragon" monsters are "[[Artillery Catapult Turtle]]" and "[[Galloping Gaia]]". The "Gaia The Fierce Knight" monster that specifically interacts with "Cursed Dragon" and supports the "Gaia" Deck's playstyle is "[[Gaia the Magical Knight]]", who can Summon any Level 5 Dragon from the hand or GY when summoned, enabling the search of "Cursed Dragon".

  The "Gaia the Dragon Champion" monsters serve as the Deck's end boards; functionally, they each require 1 "Gaia The Fierce Knight" monster and 1 "Curse of Dragon" monster as Fusion Materials. "[[Sky Galloping Gaia the Dragon Champion]]" can search "[[Spiral Spear Strike]]" when summoned to provide piercing and card cycling, while "[[Gaia the Magical Knight of Dragons]]" can gain ATK if it destroys a monster and has a [[Quick Effect]] card destruction.

  "[[Curse of Dragon, the Magical Knight Dragon]]" provides an additional extension opportunity by being able to recover a Spell/Trap that mentions "Gaia the Dragon Champion" if summoned, and enabling the player to Fusion Summon "Dragon Champion" using cards in the GY as materials. Its Fusion Materials are also counterparts to the "Gaia" + "Curse of Dragon" combination like the "Dragon Champion" monsters, meaning that if it's summoned with "Spiral Fusion", it can immediately recover "Spiral Fusion" for another Fusion.
