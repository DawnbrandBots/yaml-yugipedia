  "'''Fiendsmith'''", known as "'''Demonsmith'''" (デモンスミス ''Demonsumisu'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] monsters introduced in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]''.

  == Design ==
  Visually, the archetype seems to take influence from the ''[[wikipedia: Devil May Cry|Devil May Cry]]'' series with both "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" bearing resemblance to its protagonist [[wikipedia: Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] and the use of demon-powered weaponry existing across both mediums (especially ones both characters obtain over the course of their respective journeys to expand their combat potential). Additionally, the archetype's [[Fusion Monsters]] can be compared to the "[[wikia:w:c:devilmaycry:Devil Trigger|Devil Trigger]]" ability from the same series. Furthermore, the usage of a skull encrested coffin-shaped weapon that Engraver carries around on his back could be a reference to ''[[wikipedia:Gungrave|Gungrave]]'', a video game franchise created in response to the success of the ''Devil May Cry'' series.

  === Etymology ===
  With the exception of "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]", all cards in the archetype are named after various Latin hymns and liturgical rites from [[wikipedia:Western Christianity|Western Christianity]].

  == Playing style ==
  The archetype is largely focused around its key [[Main Deck]] monster, "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]", and its multiple [[Fusion Monster]] upgrades. Common themes of the Deck include recursion (shuffling from GY into the Deck/summoning from the GY) and Link Monsters [[equip]]ping themselves to LIGHT Fiends whilst providing additional effects.

  The Deck can easily summon Level 6 monsters, so [[Rank 6 Monster Cards|Rank 6]] monsters - most notably "[[D/D/D Wave High King Caesar]]" (as an endpiece) and "[[Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal]]" (to set up GY plays; now Forbidden in the ''[[TCG]]'', ''[[OCG]]'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel|Master Duel]]'') - are apt options.

  Non-archetypal cards with strong synergies with this Deck include:
  * "[[Fabled]]" cards, namely "[[Fabled Lurrie]]". "Lurrie" can be searched by "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]", discarded to activate its summon effect, then used to Link Summon "Requiem". In a "Fabled"-heavy strategy, "[[Fabled Krus]]" can also be searched and discarded to summon a Level 4 or lower "Fabled" in the GY.
  * "[[Necroquip Princess]]", which can be Contact Fused by sending a monster equipped with a monster card and one Fiend monster card (e.g., "Fiendsmith Engraver" with a "Fiendsmith" Link monster). "Necroquip Princess" is Level 6, making a Rank 6 even easier to summon.
  * "[[Moon of the Closed Heaven]]", since "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]" can be Link Summoned by using any LIGHT Fiend, it is easy for most Decks to access the Fiendsmith engine by using any 2 Effect Monsters to Link Summon "Closed Heaven", then use it to Link Summon "Requiem".
  * "[[Chaos Angel]]", as the engine provides an easy way of putting a Level 4 and a Level 6 LIGHT monster on the field ("[[Lacrima the Crimson Tears]]" + "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]"). The summoned "Chaos Angel" is unaffected by activated monster effects, therefore providing an easy way of removal.

  === Other LIGHT Fiend Synergies ===
  * "[[Magical Musket]]" is a LIGHT Fiend archetype that heavily benefits from Fiendsmith. The "Magical Musket" cards provide chainable interaction, while "Fiendsmith's Requiem" can be Link Summoned by using a spent "[[Magical Musketeer Max]]".
  * "[[Evil HERO]]" can provide a secondary engine; "[[Evil HERO Adusted Gold|Adusted Gold]]" is a LIGHT Fiend able to access "[[Dark Fusion]]" and cards mentioning it, as well as "[[Evil HERO Vicious Claws|Vicious Claws]]" allowing a decent free Special Summon to Link climb into "Closed Heaven".
  * "[[Primite]]" can be used to Special Summon "[[White Duston]]", a LIGHT Fiend Normal Monster, to enable both the "Primite" cards and "Fiendsmith" at the same time.
  * "[[Vaalmonica]]" has in-archetype LIGHT Fiends "[[Dimonno Vaalmonica]]" and "[[Zebufera, Vaalmonican Hallow Heathen]]". The Fiendsmith engine also has other synergies, as "[[Fabled Lurrie]]" can be discarded by "[[Angello Vaalmonica]]" or "[[Dimonno Vaalmonica]]" then special summon itself back, and "[[Lacrima the Crimson Tears]]" is a Level 4 monster that can be Pendulum Summoned by the archetype.
  * Various tech cards, such as "[[Santa Claws]]" and "[[Amanokujaki]]", can be searched by "Tract".

  === Sample combos ===
  ==== As a Deck ====
  The "Fiendsmith" archetype have several ways of starting their plays, being able to Summon their boss monster "Fiendsmith's Desirae" with relative ease. One such way is by simply opening with "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]", which is detailed below. This method has three main goals:
  # Summoning "Desirae" and equipping it with "Fiendsmith's Sequence", creating a point of interruption that can negate 2 of the opponent's cards, while also preventing it from being targeted by their effects.
  # Placing "Fiendsmith Sanct" in the GY, from where it can Set itself if "Desirae" is destroyed, thus allowing similar combos to be performed during the following turn.
  # Establishing a form of interaction and follow-up without using the player's Normal Summon or restricting the player in any way.
  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]" + 1 card
  | end     = "[[Fiendsmith's Desirae]]" equipped with "[[Fiendsmith's Sequence]]" + "[[Fiendsmith's Sanct]]" in GY
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]" to search "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" and discard 1 other card.
  # Discard "Fiendsmith Engraver" to search "[[Fiendsmith's Sanct]]".
  # Activate "Sanct" to Special Summon 1 "[[Fiendsmith Token]]".
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]" by using the "Fiendsmith Token".
  # Tribute "Requiem" to Special Summon a second "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the Deck.
  # Special Summon "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the GY by shuffling "Requiem" from the GY into the Extra Deck.
  # Activate "Tract" from the GY to [[Fusion Summon]] "[[Fiendsmith's Lacrima]]" by using the two copies of "Fiendsmith Engraver".
  # Activate "Lacrima" to Special Summon "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the GY.
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Sequence]]" by using "Lacrima" and "Engraver".
  # Activate "Sequence" to Fusion Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Desirae]]" by shuffling "Lacrima" and the two copies of "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the GY into the Deck
  # Activate "Sequence" to equip itself to "Desirae".
  }}

  ==== As an engine ====
  Due to the Deck's lack of Summoning restrictions, the "Fiendsmith" cards make a great engine for Summoning Rank 6 monsters without losing card advantage, or summon "Desirae" as an endboard piece.

  One way these cards can be used is by converting any 2 Effect Monsters into a Rank 6 monster.

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = Any 2 Effect Monsters
  | end     = 1 [[Rank]] 6 monster
  | steps   = 
  # Link Summon "[[Moon of the Closed Heaven]]" by using the 2 Effect Monsters.
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]" by using "Moon of the Closed Heaven".
  # Activate "Requiem" by Tributing itself to Special Summon "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" from the Deck.
  # Equip "Requiem" to "Engraver".
  # Special Summon "[[Necroquip Princess]]" by using "Engraver" and the equipped "Requiem".
  # Summon "Engraver" by shuffling a LIGHT Fiend monster.
  # Xyz Summon a Rank 6 monster by using "Necroquip Princess" and "Engraver".
  }}

  Another method requires the player to specifically have "Fiendsmith Engraver" in hand. While it generates less cards during the combo, it also requires less cards.
  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]"
  | end     = 1 [[Rank]] 6 monster
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" by discarding itself to add "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]" to the hand.
  # Activate "Tract" to add "[[Fabled Lurrie]]" and discard it.
  # Activate "Lurrie" to Special Summon itself.
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]" by using "Lurrie".
  # Activate "Requiem" by Tributing itself to Special Summon a second "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the Deck.
  # Activate "Fiendsmith Engraver" in the GY to return "Lurrie" to the Deck and Special Summon itself.
  # Xyz Summon a Rank 6 monster by using both copies of "Fiendsmith Engraver".

  == Weaknesses ==
  * Due to the archetype's reliance on Fiend monsters in the GY to use as fodder for the effects and Fusion Summon of "Fiendsmith Engraver" and its Fusion upgrades, cards such as "[[Soul Drain]]", "[[Abyss Dweller]]", and "[[Necrovalley]]" are especially harmful to its setup. "[[Dimension Shifter]]", "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", and "[[Macro Cosmos]]" are equally as threatening as they prevent said Fiend monsters from going to the GY in the first place.
  * Since the Link Monsters all require LIGHT Fiend monsters as material, [[Type]] and [[Attribute]] changing effects like "[[Zombie World]]", "[[Lair of Darkness]]" and "[[Clockwork Night]]" are devastating.
