  "'''Fiendsmith'''", known as "'''Demonsmith'''" (デモンスミス ''Demonsumisu'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] monsters introduced in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]''.

  == Design ==

  Visually, the archetype seems to take influence from the ''[[wikipedia: Devil May Cry|Devil May Cry]]'' series with both "[[The Fiendsmith]]" bearing resemblance to its protagonist ''[[wikipedia: Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]]'' and the use of demon-powered weaponry existing across both mediums. Additionally, the archetype's [[Fusion Monsters]] can be compared to the ''Devil Trigger'' ability from the same series.

  ===Etymology===
  Aside from the exception of the titular "[[The Fiendsmith]]", all cards in the archetype are named after various Latin hymns and liturgical rites from [[wikipedia:Western Christianity|Western Christianity]].

  == Playing style ==

  The archetype is largely focused around its eponymous [[Main Deck]] monster, "[[The Fiendsmith]]", and its multiple [[Fusion Monster]] upgrades. Said "Fiendsmith" is capable of both searching the archetype's [[Spell]]s/[[Trap]]s by [[Discard|discarding]] itself and reviving itself afterward by shuffling a fellow [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] monster into the [[Deck]]/[[Extra Deck]]. By targeting a "Fiendsmith" [[Link Monster]] treated as [[Equip Spell]]s and a monster on the field, it can also send both to the GY as a form of removal.

  Aside from its own revival effect, "The Fiendsmith" can be easily Summoned from the hand or Deck with "[[Fiendsmith Requiem]]", whom can be [[Link Summon]]ed with a single LIGHT Fiend monster. After being [[Tribute]]d for such an effect, "Requiem" can equip itself from the [[Graveyard]] to a LIGHT Fiend (optimally the archetype's Fusion Monsters) as an Equip Spell granting its monster 600 [[ATK]].

  "[[Fiendsmith Sequentia]]" continues the theme of Link Monsters supplementing "The Fiendsmith" and its Fusion upgrades by [[Fusion Summon]]ing them through shuffling their materials from the GY into the Deck, acting as another method to recycle those materials aside from "The Fiendsmith" himself. As an Equip Spell, it [[Prevents other cards being targeted by card effects|prevents its owner from being targeted by the opponent's card effects]], which is especially valuable on "Dies Irae".

  The first of the Fusion Monsters, "[[Fiendsmith Lacrimosa]]", can either add to hand or Special Summon a LIGHT Fiend from the GY upon Fusion Summon. If sent to the GY itself, it can also shuffle a LIGHT Fiend from the GY into the Deck to [[Effect damage|burn]] the opponent for 1200 [[LP]].

  The second Fusion Monster and definitive boss comes in "[[Fiendsmith Dies Irae]]". Its [[Quick Effect]] ties together the Link Monsters' tendency to equip onto LIGHT Fiends by negating the effects of face-up cards on the field up to the total [[Link Rating]] of the monster(s) equipped to it. Should it be sent to the GY, by shuffling another LIGHT Fiend into the Deck, it targets a card on the field to send to the GY as well.

  The Spell "[[Fiendsmith Tractus]]" can be considered the heart and soul of the archetype aside from "The Fiendsmith", who can search said Spell. After searching a LIGHT Fiend, it discards a card from the user's hand. After which, it can be banished from the GY to Fusion Summon a "Fiendsmith" monster with materials in the hand or field, similar to "[[Polymerization]]".

  "[[Fiendsmith Sanctus]]" is a [[Quick-Play Spell]] that Summons a "[[Fiendsmith Token]]" should the user control either no face-up monsters or only LIGHT Fiends, effectively allowing "Requiem" to be Link Summoned before "The Fiendsmith" or other Main Deck monsters come into play.

  "[[Fiendsmith in Paradisum]]" is a [[Trap]] that targets a [[Level 7]] Fiend monster (i.e. the archetype's Fusion Monsters) to send all other cards on the field to the GY. Should the opponent Special Summon while this Trap is in the GY, it can be banished to send a "Fiendsmith" monster from the Deck or Extra Deck to the GY, most likely "Lacrimosa" or "Dies Irae" for their respective burn and removal effects.

  Due to "Tractus" being able to search any LIGHT Fiend as opposed to merely "Fiendsmith" monsters, the archetype has synergy with "[[Fabled]]" and "[[Magical Musket]][[Magical Musketeer|(eer)]]". In the former's case, seeing as "Tractus" discards a card after searching, it is possible to search and then immediately discard "[[Fabled Lurrie]]" or "[[Fabled Krus]]" for their respective revival effects. As for the latter, "Magical Musket" and its own Spells/Traps provide the Deck with chainable disruption/removal it otherwise would not have, such as "[[Magical Musket - Cross-Domination|Cross Domination]]" or "[[Magical Musket - Desperado|Desperado]]". "[[Magical Musketeer Max]]" can also be used as [[Link Material]] for "Requiem" after searching or reviving "Magical Musket" cards, effectively Summoning and supporting both archetypes with a single Main Deck "Magical Musketeer" monster.

  Generic LIGHT Fiends with disruptive effects like "[[Santa Claws]]" and "[[Amanokujaki]]" can also be searched this way and be immediately made use of.

  === Sample combos ===
  The "Fiendsmith" archetype can function quite well as an engine, being able to Summon their boss monster "Fiendsmith Dies Irae" without using a [[Normal Summon]], or restricting the player's Summons to certain types of monsters. One such way is by simply opening with "[[Fiendsmith Tractus]]".
  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Fiendsmith Tractus]]" + 1 card
  | end     = "[[Fiendsmith Dies Irae]]" equipped with "[[Fiendsmith Sequentia]]" + "[[Fiendsmith Sanctus]]" in GY
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[Fiendsmith Tractus]]" to search "[[The Fiendsmith]]" and discard 1 other card.
  # Discard "The Fiendsmith" to search "[[Fiendsmith Sanctus]]".
  # Activate "Sanctus" to Special Summon 1 "[[Fiendsmith Token]]".
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith Requiem]]" by using the "Fiendsmith Token".
  # Tribute "Requiem" to Special Summon a second "The Fiendsmith" from the Deck.
  # Special Summon "The Fiendsmith" from the GY by shuffling "Requiem" from the GY into the Extra Deck.
  # Activate "Tractus" from the GY to [[Fusion Summon]] "[[Fiendsmith Lacrimosa]]" by using the two copies of "The Fiendsmith".
  # Activate "Lacrimosa" to Special Summon "The Fiendsmith" from the GY.
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith Sequentia]]" by using "Lacrimosa" and "The Fiendsmish".
  # Activate "Sequentia" to Fusion Summon "[[Fiendsmith Dies Irae]]" by shuffling "Lacrimosa" and the two copies of "The Fiendsmith" from the GY into the Deck
  # Activate "Sequentia" to equip itself to "Dies Irae".
  }}
  Following this combo, the player can still use their Normal Summon to follow up with other plays. Additionally, "Fiendsmith Sanctus" is placed in the GY, so if "Dies Irae" is destroyed by an opponent's card effect, it can Set itself back to the field, allowing for similar combos to continue during the next turn.
