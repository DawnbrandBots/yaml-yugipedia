  "'''Fiendsmith'''", known as "'''Demonsmith'''" (デモンスミス ''Demonsumisu'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] monsters introduced in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]''.

  == Design ==
  Visually, the archetype seems to take influence from the ''[[wikipedia: Devil May Cry|Devil May Cry]]'' series with both "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" bearing resemblance to its protagonist [[wikipedia: Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] and the use of demon-powered weaponry existing across both mediums (espeically ones both characters obtain over the course of their respective journeys to expand their combat potential). Additionally, the archetype's [[Fusion Monsters]] can be compared to the "[[wikia:w:c:devilmaycry:Devil Trigger|Devil Trigger]]" ability from the same series. Furthermore, the usage of a skull encrested coffin-shaped weapon that Engraver carries around on his back could be a reference to ''[[wikipedia:Gungrave|Gungrave]]'', a video game franchise created in response to the success of the ''Devil May Cry'' series.

  === Etymology ===
  With the exception of the titular "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]", all cards in the archetype are named after various Latin hymns and liturgical rites from [[wikipedia:Western Christianity|Western Christianity]].

  == Playing style ==
  The archetype is largely focused around its eponymous [[Main Deck]] monster, "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]", and its multiple [[Fusion Monster]] upgrades. Said "Engraver" is capable of both searching the archetype's [[Spell]]s/[[Trap]]s by [[Discard|discarding]] itself and reviving itself afterward by shuffling a fellow [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] monster into the [[Deck]]/[[Extra Deck]]. By targeting a "Fiendsmith" [[Link Monster]] treated as an [[Equip Spell]] and a monster on the field, it can also send both to the GY as a form of removal.

  "[[Lacrima the Crimson Tears]]" acts as the Deck's de facto [[Normal Summon]], given its low [[Level]] of 4 and ability to send archetypal cards to the GY upon Summon. Keeping in theme with the archetype's recursion, as a [[Quick Effect]] during the opponent's turn it can also shuffle itself into the Deck to revive a fellow LIGHT Fiend monster, potentially allowing for a follow-up the next turn.

  Aside from its own revival effect, "Fiendsmith Engraver" can be easily Summoned from the hand or Deck with "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]", whom can be [[Link Summon]]ed with a single LIGHT Fiend monster. After being [[Tribute]]d for such an effect, "Requiem" can equip itself from the [[Graveyard]] to a LIGHT Fiend (optimally the archetype's Fusion Monsters) as an Equip Spell granting its monster 600 [[ATK]].

  "[[Fiendsmith's Sequence]]" continues the theme of Link Monsters supplementing "Fiendsmith Engraver" and its Fusion upgrades by [[Fusion Summon]]ing them through shuffling their materials from the GY into the Deck, acting as another method to recycle those materials aside from "Fiendsmith Engraver" himself. As an Equip Spell, it [[Prevents other cards being targeted by card effects|prevents its monster from being targeted by the opponent's card effects]], which is especially valuable on "Desirae".

  The first of the Fusion Monsters, "[[Fiendsmith's Lacrima]]", can either add to hand or Special Summon a LIGHT Fiend from the GY upon Fusion Summon. If sent to the GY itself, it can also shuffle a LIGHT Fiend from the GY into the Deck to [[Effect damage|burn]] the opponent for 1200 [[LP]].

  The second Fusion Monster and definitive boss comes in "[[Fiendsmith's Desirae]]". Its [[Quick Effect]] ties together the Link Monsters' tendency to equip onto LIGHT Fiends by negating the effects of face-up cards on the field up to the total [[Link Rating]] of the monster(s) equipped to it. Should it be sent to the GY, by shuffling another LIGHT Fiend into the Deck, it targets a card on the field to send to the GY as well.

  The Spell "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]" can be considered the heart and soul of the archetype aside from "Fiendsmith Engraver", who can search said Spell. After searching a LIGHT Fiend, it discards a card from the user's hand. After which, it can be banished from the GY to Fusion Summon a "Fiendsmith" monster with materials in the hand or field, similar to "[[Polymerization]]".

  "[[Fiendsmith's Sanct]]" is a [[Quick-Play Spell]] that Summons a "[[Fiendsmith Token]]" should the user control either no face-up monsters or only LIGHT Fiends, effectively allowing "Requiem" to be Link Summoned before "Fiendsmith Engraver" or other Main Deck monsters come into play. Should a "Fiendsmith" monster be destroyed by card effect, it can [[Set]] itself for future use and recoup the loss of the destroyed monster.

  "[[Fiendsmith in Paradise]]" is a [[Trap]] that targets a [[Level 7]] or higher Fiend monster (e.g. "Desirae") to send all other cards on the field to the GY. Should the opponent Special Summon while this Trap is in the GY, it can be banished to send a "Fiendsmith" monster from the Deck or Extra Deck to the GY, most likely "Lacrima" or "Desirae" to allow interaction through their respective burn and removal effects.

  Due to "Tract" being able to search any LIGHT Fiend as opposed to merely "Fiendsmith" monsters, the archetype has synergy with "[[Fabled]]" and "[[Magical Musket]][[Magical Musketeer|(eer)]]". In the former's case, seeing as "Tract" discards a card after searching, it is possible to search and then immediately discard "[[Fabled Lurrie]]" or "[[Fabled Krus]]" for their respective revival effects. As for the latter, "Magical Musket" and its own Spells/Traps provide the Deck with chainable disruption/removal it otherwise would not have, such as "[[Magical Musket - Cross-Domination|Cross Domination]]" or "[[Magical Musket - Desperado|Desperado]]". "[[Magical Musketeer Max]]" can also be used as [[Link Material]] for "Requiem" after searching or reviving "Magical Musket" cards, effectively Summoning and supporting both archetypes with a single Main Deck "Magical Musketeer" monster.

  Generic LIGHT Fiends with disruptive effects like "[[Santa Claws]]" and "[[Amanokujaki]]" can also be searched this way and be immediately made use of.

  Due to the ease at which the archetype can Summon Level 6 monsters, various Rank 6 [[Xyz Monsters]] are apt tech options. The most notable example being "[[D/D/D Wave High King Caesar]]" as an end piece, but also "[[Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal]]" for its ability to set up virtually any GY play. Given "Fiendsmith's Lacrima" is more often than not the enabler/material for such Rank 6 Summons, it is possible to detach it from "Beatrice" to send "[[Angel of Blue Tears]]" to the GY. After triggering "Lacrima" effect in GY to inflict 1200 damage to the opponent, "Angel of Blue Tears" will trigger, banishing itself to set a [[Normal Trap]] directly from hand or Deck to set up interaction for later.

  === Sample combos ===
  ==== As a Deck ====
  The "Fiendsmith" archetype have several ways of starting their plays, being able to Summon their boss monster "Fiendsmith's Desirae" with relative ease. One such way is by simply opening with "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]", which is detailed below. This method has three main goals:
  # Summoning "Desirae" and equipping it with "Fiendsmith's Sequence", creating a point of interruption that can negate 2 of the opponent's cards, while also preventing it from being targeted by their effects.
  # Placing "Fiendsmith Sanct" in the GY, from where it can Set itself if "Desirae" is destroyed, thus allowing similar combos to be performed during the following turn.
  # Establishing a form of interaction and follow-up without using the player's Normal Summon, or restricting their Special Summons.
  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]" + 1 card
  | end     = "[[Fiendsmith's Desirae]]" equipped with "[[Fiendsmith's Sequence]]" + "[[Fiendsmith's Sanct]]" in GY
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]" to search "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" and discard 1 other card.
  # Discard "Fiendsmith Engraver" to search "[[Fiendsmith's Sanct]]".
  # Activate "Sanct" to Special Summon 1 "[[Fiendsmith Token]]".
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]" by using the "Fiendsmith Token".
  # Tribute "Requiem" to Special Summon a second "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the Deck.
  # Special Summon "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the GY by shuffling "Requiem" from the GY into the Extra Deck.
  # Activate "Tract" from the GY to [[Fusion Summon]] "[[Fiendsmith's Lacrima]]" by using the two copies of "Fiendsmith Engraver".
  # Activate "Lacrima" to Special Summon "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the GY.
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Sequence]]" by using "Lacrima" and "Engraver".
  # Activate "Sequence" to Fusion Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Desirae]]" by shuffling "Lacrima" and the two copies of "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the GY into the Deck
  # Activate "Sequence" to equip itself to "Desirae".
  }}

  ==== As an engine ====
  Due to the Deck's lack of Summoning restrictions, the "Fiendsmith" cards make a great engine for Summoning Rank 6 monsters, without losing card advantage.

  One way these cards can be used is in the middle of any combo that has 3 monsters left on the field (with 2 of those being [[Effect Monster]]s). This gives access to any [[Rank]] 6 monster (most notably "[[Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal]]"), and also leaves a Link-2 monster on the field ("Sequence") and allows "Fiendsmith Engraver" to Special Summon itself back from the GY later.

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = Any 2 Effect Monsters + 1 monster
  | end     = 1 [[Rank]] 6 monster and "[[Fiendsmith's Sequence]]" + 1 "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" in GY
  | steps   = 
  # Link Summon "[[Moon of the Closed Heaven]]" by using the 2 Effect Monsters.
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]" by using "Moon of the Closed Heaven".
  # Activate "Requiem" by Tributing itself to Special Summon "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" from the Deck.
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Sequence]]" by using the last remaining monster and "Fiendsmith Engraver".
  # Activate "Sequence" to Fusion Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Lacrima]]" by shuffling "Requiem" and "Moon of the Closed Heaven" from the GY into the Extra Deck.
  # Activate "Lacrima" to Special Summon "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the GY.
  # Xyz Summon a Rank 6 monster by using "Lacrima" and "Fiendsmith Engraver".
  }}

  Another method requires the player to specifically have "Fiendsmith Engraver" in hand. While it generates less cards during the combo, it also requires less cards, and doesn't use the player's [[Normal Summon]].
  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]"
  | end     = 1 [[Rank]] 6 monster
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" by discarding itself to add "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]" to the hand.
  # Activate "Tract" to add "[[Fabled Lurrie]]" and discard it.
  # Activate "Lurrie" to Special Summon itself.
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]" by using "Lurrie".
  # Activate "Requiem" by Tributing itself to Special Summon a second "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the Deck.
  # Activate "Fiendsmith Engraver" in the GY to return "Lurrie" to the Deck and Special Summon itself.
  # Xyz Summon a Rank 6 monster by using both copies of "Fiendsmith Engraver".

  == Weaknesses ==
  * Due to the archetype's reliance on Fiend monsters in the GY to use as fodder for the effects and Fusion Summon of "Fiendsmith Engraver" and its Fusion upgrades, cards such as "[[Soul Drain]]", "[[Abyss Dweller]]", and "[[Necrovalley]]" are especially harmful to its setup. "[[Dimension Shifter]]", "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", and "[[Macro Cosmos]]" are equally as threatening as they prevent said Fiend monsters from going to the GY in the first place.
  * In terms of Fiend monsters specifically, cards that change [[Type]]s and [[Attribute]]s on the field and GY such as "[[Zombie World]]" or "[[Lair of Darkness]]" pose a similar problem, as the archetype's Extra Deck monsters all call for LIGHT Fiends to be used as material.
