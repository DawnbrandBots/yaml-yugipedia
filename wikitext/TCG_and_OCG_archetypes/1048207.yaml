  "'''Fiendsmith'''", known as "'''Demonsmith'''" (デモンスミス ''Demonsumisu'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] monsters introduced in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]''.

  == Design ==
  Visually, the archetype seems to take influence from the ''[[wikipedia: Devil May Cry|Devil May Cry]]'' series with both "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" bearing resemblance to its protagonist [[wikipedia: Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] and the use of demon-powered weaponry existing across both mediums (especially ones both characters obtain over the course of their respective journeys to expand their combat potential). Additionally, the archetype's [[Fusion Monsters]] can be compared to the "[[wikia:w:c:devilmaycry:Devil Trigger|Devil Trigger]]" ability from the same series. Furthermore, the usage of a skull encrested coffin-shaped weapon that Engraver carries around on his back could be a reference to ''[[wikipedia:Gungrave|Gungrave]]'', a video game franchise created in response to the success of the ''Devil May Cry'' series.

  === Etymology ===
  With the exception of the titular "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]", all cards in the archetype are named after various Latin hymns and liturgical rites from [[wikipedia:Western Christianity|Western Christianity]].

  == Playing style ==
  The archetype is largely focused around its eponymous [[Main Deck]] monster, "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]", and its multiple [[Fusion Monster]] upgrades. Common themes of the Deck include recursion (shuffling from GY into the Deck/summoning from the GY) and Link Monsters equipping themselves to LIGHT Fiends.

  ! Card
  ! Description
  |-
  | [[Fiendsmith Engraver]]
  | Can discard itself from hand to search a "Fiendsmith" Spell/Trap. Can summon itself from the GY by shuffling another [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] monster from GY to the Deck. Can send target an equipped "Fiendsmith" [[Link Monster]] and a monster to send both to the GY.
  |-
  | [[Lacrima the Crimson Tears]]
  | The main Normal Summon of the archetype, it can send a "Fiendsmith" card to the GY. During the opponent's turn, it can shuffle itself to revive a LIGHT Fiend monster.
  |-
  |  [[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]
  | Requires 1 LIGHT Fiend to be Link Summoned, allowing most Decks to bridge into a Fiendsmith engine. Can Tribute itself to summon a "Fiendsmith" monster from hand or Deck. In the GY, it can equip itself to a LIGHT non-Link Fiend monster.
  |-
  | [[Fiendsmith's Sequence]]
  | Can Fusion Summon a "Fiendsmith" card by shuffling the required materials from GY to the Deck. In the GY, it can equip itself to a LIGHT non-Link Fiend monster.
  |-
  | [[Fiendsmith's Tract]]
  | Searches a LIGHT Fiend monster, then discards a card. Can banish itself from the GY to Fusion Summon a "Fiendsmith" monster, using materials from hand or field.
  |-
  | [[Fiendsmith's Lacrima]]
  | On Summon, it can add to hand or Special Summon a LIGHT Fiend from the GY/Banishment. When sent to the GY, can shuffle a LIGHT Fiend into the GY into the Deck to deal 1200 LP.
  |-
  | [[Fiendsmith's Desirae]]
  | The main boss monster of the archetype, it can negate the effects of cards up to the Link Rating of Link Monsters equipped to this card. When sent to the GY, sends a targeted card to the GY.
  |-
  | [[Fiendsmith's Sanct]]
  | If you control no monsters or only LIGHT Fiend monsters, Special Summons a Fiendsmith Token (which is a LIGHT Fiend, enabling the Link Summon of "Tract"). Also, if a "Fiendsmith" is destroyed by an opponent's card effect, it can set itself from the GY.
  |-
  | [[Fiendsmith in Paradise]]
  | Targets a Level 7 or higher LIGHT Fiend, then sends all other cards on field to the GY. When your opponent Special Summons, it can banish itself to mill a "Fiendsmith" from Deck/Extra Deck to GY.
  |}

  The Deck can easily summon Level 6 monsters, so [[Rank 6 Monster Cards|Rank 6]] monsters - most notably "[[D/D/D Wave High King Caesar]]" (as an endpiece) and "[[Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal]]" (to set up GY plays; banned in the ''[[TCG]]''/''[[OCG]]'') - are apt options.

  Non-archetypal cards with strong synergies with this Deck include:
  * "[[Fabled]]" cards, namely "[[Fabled Lurrie]]". "Lurrie" can be searched by "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]", discarded to activate its summon effect, then used to Link Summon "Requiem". In a "Fabled"-heavy strategy, "[[Fabled Krus]]" can also be searched and discarded to summon a Level 4 or lower "Fabled" in the GY.
  * "[[Necroquip Princess]]", which can be Contact Fused by sending a monster equipped with a monster card and one Fiend monster card (e.g., "Fiendsmith Engraver" with a "Fiendsmith" Link monster). "Necroquip Princess" is Level 6, making a Rank 6 even easier to summon.

  Since "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]" can be Link Summoned by using any LIGHT Fiend, it is easy for most Decks to access the Fiendsmith engine: use any 2 Effect Monsters to Link Summon "[[Moon of the Closed Heaven]]", then use it to Link Summon "Requiem".

  === Other LIGHT Fiend Synergies ===
  * "[[Magical Musket]]" is a LIGHT Fiend archetype that heavily benefits from Fiendsmith. The "Magical Musket" cards provide chainable interaction, while "Fiendsmith's Requiem" can be Link Summoned by using a spent "[[Magical Musketeer Max]]".
  * "[[Evil HERO]]" can provide a secondary engine; "[[Evil HERO Adusted Gold|Adusted Gold]]" is a LIGHT Fiend able to access "[[Dark Fusion]]" and cards mentioning it, as well as "[[Evil HERO Vicious Claws|Vicious Claws]]" allowing a decent free Special Summon to Link climb into "Closed Heaven".
  * "[[Primite]]" can be used to Special Summon "[[White Duston]]", a LIGHT Fiend Normal Monster, to enable both the "Primite" cards and "Fiendsmith" at the same time.
  * Various tech cards, such as "[[Santa Claws]]" and "[[Amanokujaki]]", can be searched by "Tract".

  === Sample combos ===
  ==== As a Deck ====
  The "Fiendsmith" archetype have several ways of starting their plays, being able to Summon their boss monster "Fiendsmith's Desirae" with relative ease. One such way is by simply opening with "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]", which is detailed below. This method has three main goals:
  # Summoning "Desirae" and equipping it with "Fiendsmith's Sequence", creating a point of interruption that can negate 2 of the opponent's cards, while also preventing it from being targeted by their effects.
  # Placing "Fiendsmith Sanct" in the GY, from where it can Set itself if "Desirae" is destroyed, thus allowing similar combos to be performed during the following turn.
  # Establishing a form of interaction and follow-up without using the player's Normal Summon or restricting the player in any way.
  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]" + 1 card
  | end     = "[[Fiendsmith's Desirae]]" equipped with "[[Fiendsmith's Sequence]]" + "[[Fiendsmith's Sanct]]" in GY
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]" to search "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" and discard 1 other card.
  # Discard "Fiendsmith Engraver" to search "[[Fiendsmith's Sanct]]".
  # Activate "Sanct" to Special Summon 1 "[[Fiendsmith Token]]".
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]" by using the "Fiendsmith Token".
  # Tribute "Requiem" to Special Summon a second "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the Deck.
  # Special Summon "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the GY by shuffling "Requiem" from the GY into the Extra Deck.
  # Activate "Tract" from the GY to [[Fusion Summon]] "[[Fiendsmith's Lacrima]]" by using the two copies of "Fiendsmith Engraver".
  # Activate "Lacrima" to Special Summon "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the GY.
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Sequence]]" by using "Lacrima" and "Engraver".
  # Activate "Sequence" to Fusion Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Desirae]]" by shuffling "Lacrima" and the two copies of "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the GY into the Deck
  # Activate "Sequence" to equip itself to "Desirae".
  }}

  ==== As an engine ====
  Due to the Deck's lack of Summoning restrictions, the "Fiendsmith" cards make a great engine for Summoning Rank 6 monsters without losing card advantage.

  One way these cards can be used is by converting any 2 Effect Monsters into a Rank 6 monster.

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = Any 2 Effect Monsters
  | end     = 1 [[Rank]] 6 monster
  | steps   = 
  # Link Summon "[[Moon of the Closed Heaven]]" by using the 2 Effect Monsters.
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]" by using "Moon of the Closed Heaven".
  # Activate "Requiem" by Tributing itself to Special Summon "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" from the Deck.
  # Equip "Requiem" to "Engraver".
  # Special Summon "[[Necroquip Princess]]" by using "Engraver" and the equipped "Requiem".
  # Summon "Engraver" by shuffling a LIGHT Fiend monster.
  # Xyz Summon a Rank 6 monster by using "Necroquip Princess" and "Engraver".
  }}

  Another method requires the player to specifically have "Fiendsmith Engraver" in hand. While it generates less cards during the combo, it also requires less cards.
  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]"
  | end     = 1 [[Rank]] 6 monster
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[Fiendsmith Engraver]]" by discarding itself to add "[[Fiendsmith's Tract]]" to the hand.
  # Activate "Tract" to add "[[Fabled Lurrie]]" and discard it.
  # Activate "Lurrie" to Special Summon itself.
  # Link Summon "[[Fiendsmith's Requiem]]" by using "Lurrie".
  # Activate "Requiem" by Tributing itself to Special Summon a second "Fiendsmith Engraver" from the Deck.
  # Activate "Fiendsmith Engraver" in the GY to return "Lurrie" to the Deck and Special Summon itself.
  # Xyz Summon a Rank 6 monster by using both copies of "Fiendsmith Engraver".

  }}

  == Weaknesses ==
  * Due to the archetype's reliance on Fiend monsters in the GY to use as fodder for the effects and Fusion Summon of "Fiendsmith Engraver" and its Fusion upgrades, cards such as "[[Soul Drain]]", "[[Abyss Dweller]]", and "[[Necrovalley]]" are especially harmful to its setup. "[[Dimension Shifter]]", "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", and "[[Macro Cosmos]]" are equally as threatening as they prevent said Fiend monsters from going to the GY in the first place.
  * Since the Link monsters all require LIGHT Fiend monsters as material, [[Type]] and [[Attribute]] changing effects like "[[Zombie World]]" and "[[Lair of Darkness]]" are devastating.
