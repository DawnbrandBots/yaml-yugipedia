  "'''Sennen'''" ({{Ruby|千年|せんねん}} ''Sennen''), known as "'''Millennium'''" in the ''[[TCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of cards themed around the [[Millennium Items]]. "[[Sengenjin]]" is a "Sennen" card as it has 「{{Ruby|千年|せんねん}}」 in its Japanese name; in the ''TCG'', it has an [[archetype condition]] that treats it as a "Millennium" monster.

  It is correlated to, but technically separate from, the "[[Millennium]]" archetype. However the distinction between the two is negligible for gameplay purposes, as cards that support one always support the other as well. This situation is the result of the use of synonyms in Japanese, with "Sennen" simply also localized to "Millennium" in most cases in other languages, for years prior to the introduction of the first support. (A comparable situation exists for the "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" and "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" archetypes.)

  == Design ==
  The majority of the archetype are cards released very early on in the franchise's history and their retrains, and cards related to important artifacts from Ancient Egypt in the manga and anime. The early monsters were primarily [[Normal Monster]]s whose [[flavor text]]s mention ancient treasures, with some even mentioning Millennium Items. Despite this, none of the Millennium Items were present in their artworks.
