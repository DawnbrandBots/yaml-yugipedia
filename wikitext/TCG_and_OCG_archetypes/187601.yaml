  "'''Gagaga'''" (ガガガ ''Gagaga'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Spellcaster]] and [[EARTH]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by the protagonist of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (manga)|manga]], [[Yuma Tsukumo]].

  == Etymology ==
  [[File:Gagaga crest.png|left|thumb|100px|The "Gagaga" crest]]

  The archetype name is derived the Japanese onomatopoeia "ga", which is used for physical impacts, similar to the English "pow" used in comics. This is reflected in how the members of the archetype are depicted using mostly physical attacks rather than magical attacks in the anime and manga.

  All members of the archetype feature a crest of the Chinese character for the first person pronoun (我), which can be pronounced "wa" or "ga" in Japanese. The crest cannot always be seen on the individual card's artwork though, but can be seen in the anime and manga, usually on the monsters' backs.

  The design of the male members of the archetype cover the lower part of their faces with scarves, except "[[Gagaga Child]]".

  The archetype's two most prominent members, "[[Gagaga Magician]]" and "[[Gagaga Girl]]", bear a striking similar appearance to "[[Dark Magician]]" and "[[Dark Magician Girl]]" respectively, monsters used by [[Yugi Muto]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]]. They are DARK Spellcaster monsters whose [[Level]]s are 3 lower and whose [[original ATK]] are 1000 less than those of their "Dark Magician" counterparts. Both monsters also share a [[wikipedia:Senpai and kōhai|''senpai'' and ''kōhai'']] relationship, similar to how their "Dark Magician" counterparts shared a master and apprentice relationship.

  == Playing style ==
  "Gagaga" monsters have effects that change their [[Level]]s, enabling quick [[Xyz Summon]]s.
  * "Gagaga Magician" can change its level from 1 to 8. 
  * "Gagaga Girl" can copy a "Gagaga" monster's level, and is an integral part of an OTK strategy combining its other effect with "[[Number 33: Chronomaly Machu Mech]]".
  * "Gagaga Child" can Special Summon itself if you control another "Gagaga" monster, then copy its level at the cost of the Battle Phase. 
  * "[[Gagaga Sister]]" can [[search]] an archetypal Spell/Trap, such as "[[Gagagabolt]]" for removal and "[[Gagagarevenge]]" to help revive "Gagaga" monsters. In combination with Magician, the archetype can make Xyz Monsters for just about any situation that are Rank 10 and under. 
  * "[[Gagaga Caesar]]" can banish 1 monster from the graveyard so that all "Gagaga" monsters become the banished monster's Level.

  While not possessing level changing effects, "[[Gagaga Ganbara Knight]]", "*[[Zubababancho Gagagacoat]]", and "[[Gagaga Clerk]]" act as in-archetype extenders, and combo well with "Gagaga Sister" for making rank 4 and 6 monsters. 

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "Gagaga" monsters are slow to set up, even for the time.
  **  A good way to mitigate this is to combine "[[Dododo]]" monsters in the deck such as "[[Dododo Warrior]]" which has a high level and is easily used along "[[Dododo Witch]]" and "[[Dododo Driver]]". "[[Onomatopaira]]" can search key monsters in both "Onomat" archetypes, while "[[Dodododraw]]" can discard said "Dododo monster" to draw 2 cards. "[[Gagaga Mancer]]" can also speed up the summoning power by reviving another "Gagaga" monster, though at the cost of not being able to summon any other monsters except "Gagaga" monsters. 
  * They also lack raw ATK for their Level/Rank, with the highest original attack being "Gagaga Head" at 2100 (though "Gagaga Cowboy" can contest monsters up to 3000 ATK during your turn).
