  "'''Voiceless Voice'''" ({{Ruby|粛|しゅく}}{{Ruby|声|せい}} ''Shukusei'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] monsters introduced in ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]''. It is related to the "[[Skull Guardian (archetype)|Skull Guardian]]" [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]] archetype.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  The theme's Japanese name may be a play on 「粛正」 (''shukusei'', "regulation" or "enforcement"), where the first kanji can mean "solemn" or "quiet", and the second one is replaced with 「声」 ("voice"); in addition, reversing the order of kanji forms ''seishuku'', which is the reading of 「静粛」 ("silence"). It might be a reference to the ''TCG'' name of "[[Novox's Prayer]]", as "Novox" can be interpreted as "no vox" (from ''vōx'', Latin for "voice").

  ===Members===
  The base forms of all members share the same [[Attribute]], [[Type]], [[Level]], [[ATK]], and [[DEF]] as their original counterparts (except for "Novox", whose counterpart is a [[Ritual Spell Card|Ritual Spell]]).

  ==Playing style==
  "Voiceless Voice" is a midrange [[Ritual]] Deck that focuses on Ritual Summoning "[[Skull Guardian, Protector of the Voiceless Voice]]" and setting up Continuous Spells/Traps for constant recursion.

  * The main searchers are:
  ** "[[Lo, the Prayers of the Voiceless Voice|Lo]]", which places a Continuous Spell/Trap on the field on Summon. It also acts as the entire Tribute material for a Ritual Summon, and Special Summons itself if a LIGHT Ritual is Summoned.
  ** "[[Barrier of the Voiceless Voice|Barrier]]", which searches a "Voiceless Voice" monster, and protects LIGHT monsters from targeting if both "Lo" and "Skull Guardian, Protector of the Voiceless Voice" are on field.
  ** "[[Saffira, Dragon Queen of the Voiceless Voice|Saffira, Dragon Sage]]", which searches a LIGHT Warrior/Dragon Ritual Monster, mills a Ritual Spell, and performs a Ritual Summon.
  * "[[Prayers of the Voiceless Voice|Prayers]]" is Ritual Spell that can summon a LIGHT Ritual from hand. Also, if a LIGHT Ritual monster is removed from the field, it can banish itself from the GY to summon one of three in-theme monsters.
  * "[[Skull Guardian, Protector of the Voiceless Voice|Skull Guardian, Protector]]" is one of the major endpieces of the Deck - it is a Ritual Monster that searches a "Voiceless Voice" Continuous Spell/Trap, and if "Lo" is on field, it is an omni-negate.
  * "[[Sauravis, Dragon Sage of the Voiceless Voice|Sauravis, Dragon Sage]]" can shuffle 2 Spells from hand/GY from Deck to summon itself. On field, it can Special Summon a LIGHT/Dragon Warrior Ritual from hand.
  * "[[Blessing of the Voiceless Voice|Blessing]]" is a major recursion tool, recycling a card from GY or banishment each turn. It also enable a Ritual Summon if any non-Ritual Monster is Summoned.
  * "[[Radiance of the Voiceless Voice|Radiance]]" can either shuffle a LIGHT Warrior/Dragon from hand/GY to Special Summon a LIGHT Warrior/Dragon Ritual from Deck, or destroy itself and opposing cards up to the number of LIGHT Warrior/Dragons the player controls.

  "[[Saffira, Queen of Dragons]]" and "[[Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended]]", while not part of the archetype, are supported by the archetype and can be played alongside it. Other LIGHT Warrior/Dragon Ritual Monsters, such as "[[Odd-Eyes Pendulumgraph Dragon]]", can also be used.

  Other cards often found in "Voiceless Voice" decks include:
  * "[[Diviner of the Herald]]", "[[Trias Hierarchia]]", "[[Herald of the Arc Light]]": "Diviner" can send "Trias Hierarchia" from the Deck to the GY. The latter can then Tribute "Diviner", allowing the Special Summon of "Lo" from the Deck. If "Trias Hierarchia" is already available, "Herald of the Arc Light" can be sent to search for a Ritual Card.
  * "[[Dogmatika]]" package ("[[Nadir Servant]]", "[[Dogmatika Maximus]]", cards in Extra Deck with GY effects): "Voiceless Voice" does not require the Extra Deck, allowing them to use this package to gain advantage.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Being able to stop "Lo" from getting on the field will disable certain "Voiceless Voice" cards. Using cards like "[[D.D. Crow]]" and "[[Bystial]]s" on "Lo's" GY Summon effect may be devastating (assuming another copy of "Lo" can't be summoned).

  ==Trivia==
  * The artwork of "Voiceless Voice" monsters features mosaic pattern in their background, as a homage to the original "[[Skull Guardian]]" that has similar pattern in the background.
