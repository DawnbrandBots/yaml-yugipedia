  "'''Voiceless Voice'''" ({{Ruby|粛|しゅく}}{{Ruby|声|せい}} ''Shukusei'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] monsters introduced in ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]''. It is related to the "[[Skull Guardian (archetype)|Skull Guardian]]" [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]] archetype.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#No. 02: Voiceless Voice}}

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  The theme's Japanese name may be a play on 「粛正」 (''shukusei'', "regulation" or "enforcement"), where the first kanji can mean "solemn" or "quiet", and the second one is replaced with 「声」 ("voice"); in addition, reversing the order of kanji forms ''seishuku'', which is the reading of 「静粛」 ("silence"). It might be a reference to the ''TCG'' name of "[[Novox's Prayer]]", as "Novox" can be interpreted as "no vox" (from ''vōx'', Latin for "voice").

  ===Members===
  The base forms of all members share the same [[Attribute]], [[Type]], [[Level]], [[ATK]], and [[DEF]] as their original counterparts (except for "Novox", whose counterpart is a [[Ritual Spell Card|Ritual Spell]]).

  ==Playing style==
  "Voiceless Voice" focuses on Ritual Summoning "[[Skull Guardian, Protector of the Voiceless Voice]]". It shares identical stats as its original, [[Skull Guardian|classic counterpart]], with unique ATK value at 2050, but if "[[Lo, the Prayers of the Voiceless Voice]]" is on the [[field]] or in the [[GY]], it can boost its own ATK to 4100. Furthermore, if "Lo" is on the field, "Skull Guardian, Protector of the Voiceless Voice" is an omni-negate.

  This archetype can effectively perform multiple Ritual Summons in a single turn. Ritual Summoning "Skull Guardian, Protector of the Voiceless Voice" by Tributing "Lo, the Prayers of the Voiceless Voice" (which can serve as an entire Tribute for the Ritual Summon) would in turn give the player further access to another "Voiceless Voice" monster (or any Warrior or Dragon Ritual monster in general), also, "Lo" can be revived from the GY by the time "Skull Guardian, Protector of the Voiceless Voice" is Special Summoned.

  The Normal/Special Summoned "Lo" enables the player to play one of the archetype's Continuous Spell/Trap directly from the Deck. The option, however, is situational; the Continuous Spell "[[Barrier of the Voiceless Voice]]" is a good card that provides protection to your LIGHT monsters, while at the same time redirects opponent's attacks toward your Ritual Monsters only. This continuous effect is effective to protect "Lo" from attacks and card effects, while the buffed "Skull Guardian, Protector of the Voiceless Voice" can serve as a big wall for battles. The spell also allows the player to tutor any "Voiceless Voice" card or a "Skull Guardian" Ritual Monster from the Deck, promoting another variety of gameplay with any "Voiceless Voice" card, such as "[[Saffira, Dragon Queen of the Voiceless Voice]]" to perform further combo of Ritual Summoning. If the player chose to play the Continuous Trap "[[Radiance of the Voiceless Voice]]", it allows player to add (or in some case, Special Summon) a "Voiceless Voice" monster straight from the Deck, or access more offensive play for field removal.

  This archetype works well with the other thematic Ritual Monsters: "[[Saffira, Queen of Dragons]]" and "[[Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended]]". They normally require "[[Hymn of Light]]" and "[[Sprite's Blessing]]" respectively to Summon, but both of them can also be Ritual Summoned by "Prayers of the Voiceless Voice" or by the effect of "Saffira, Dragon Queen of the Voiceless Voice". In addition to its connection to the archetype's lore, "Hymn of Light" is actually a good choice for the first effect of "Saffira, Dragon Queen of the Voiceless Voice" where it can mill the Spell to tutor a LIGHT Warrior or Dragon Ritual Monster from the Deck or GY, and at the same time, "Hymn of Light" in the GY provides destruction protection for your Ritual Monster(s).

  On the other hand, "[[Sauravis, Dragon Sage of the Voiceless Voice]]" is more likely to be an alternative beatstick that can be Special Summoned by shuffling two Spells, with at least one Ritual Spell among them, from the hand and/or GY to the Deck. It can also provide 'emergency' Ritual Summoning of any LIGHT Warrior or Dragon Ritual Monster from the player's hand or Deck in response to the activation of your opponent's card or effect.
