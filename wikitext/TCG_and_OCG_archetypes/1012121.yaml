  "'''Voiceless Voice'''" ({{Ruby|粛|しゅく}}{{Ruby|声|せい}} ''Shukusei'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] monsters introduced in ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]''. It is related to the "[[Skull Guardian (archetype)|Skull Guardian]]" [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]] archetype.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  The theme's Japanese name may be a play on 「粛正」 (''shukusei'', "regulation" or "enforcement"), where the first kanji can mean "solemn" or "quiet", and the second one is replaced with 「声」 ("voice"); in addition, reversing the order of kanji forms ''seishuku'', which is the reading of 「静粛」 ("silence"). It might be a reference to the ''TCG'' name of "[[Novox's Prayer]]", as "Novox" can be interpreted as "no vox" (from ''vōx'', Latin for "voice").

  ===Members===
  The base forms of all members share the same [[Attribute]], [[Type]], [[Level]], [[ATK]], and [[DEF]] as their original counterparts (except for "Novox", whose counterpart is a [[Ritual Spell Card|Ritual Spell]]).

  ==Playing style==
  "Voiceless Voice" is a 'midrange' [[Ritual]] Deck that focuses on Ritual Summoning "[[Skull Guardian, Protector of the Voiceless Voice]]" and setting up Continuous Spells/Traps for constant recursion.

  ! Card
  ! Description
  |-
  |[[Skull Guardian, Protector of the Voiceless Voice]]
  |So long as "Lo" is on the field, this card acts as an omni-negate with 4100 ATK. On Ritual Summon, it also searches out a "Voiceless Voice" monster or a Warrior/Dragon Ritual Monster.
  |-
  |[[Lo, the Prayers of the Voiceless Voice]]
  |One of the Deck's key cards. Can be used as the entire material for a Ritual Summon, and when a LIGHT Warrior/Dragon Ritual Monster is summoned, can Special Summon itself from the GY. Also, when Summoned, searches out a "Voiceless Voice" Continuous spell.
  |-
  |[[Saffira, Dragon Queen of the Voiceless Voice]]
  |In hand, can mill a Ritual Spell and search for a LIGHT Warrior/Dragon Ritual monster. In GY, can banish itself to perform a Ritual Summon a LIGHT Warrior/Dragon Ritual monster.
  |-
  |[[Saffira, Divine Dragon of the Voiceless Voice]]
  |If Ritual Summoned with "Lo" on the field, you can draw 2 and discard 1. Recycles LIGHT monsters from GY to hand during your opponent's End Phase, and discards 1 random card in your opponent's hand if a LIGHT Warrior/Dragon Ritual Monster battles.
  |-
  |[[Sauravis, Dragon Sage of the Voiceless Voice]]
  |Can Special Summon itself from hand by shuffling 2 Spells from GY to hand. On field, can Special Summon a LIGHT Warrior/Dragon Ritual Monster from hand (but it is shuffled into the Deck at the end of the turn).
  |-
  |[[Prayers of the Voiceless Voice]]
  | A Ritual Spell. Also, if a "Voiceless Voice" monster leaves the field by an opponent's card effect, it can banish itself from the GY to Special Summon an archetype-related Ritual Monster from Deck.
  |-
  |[[Barrier of the Voiceless Voice]]
  |If a LIGHT Ritual monster and "Lo" are on your field, prevents LIGHT monsters from being targeted, and protects non-Ritual monsters from battle. Also searches out a "Voiceless Voice" or "Skull Guardian" card every turn.
  |-
  |[[Blessing of the Voiceless Voice]]
  |Returns a "Voiceless Voice" card in the GY/banishment to the hand, and can perform a Ritual Summon if a non-Ritual monster is Summoned to your field.
  |-
  |[[Radiance of the Voiceless Voice]]
  |Can either:
  * Shuffle a LIGHT Warrior/Dragon Ritual monster from hand or GY to Deck, to Special Summon a LIGHT Warrior/Dragon Ritual Monster from Deck.
  * Destroy itself, and destroy cards your opponent controls equal to the number of LIGHT Warrior/Dragon Ritual Monsters you control.
  |}

  This archetype works well with "[[Saffira, Queen of Dragons]]" and "[[Sauravis, the Ancient and Ascended]]", which are directly supported by "Prayers of the Voiceless Voice", and benefit from the Deck's emphasis on LIGHT Warrior/Dragon Ritual monsters.. Other LIGHT Warrior/Dragon Ritual Monsters, such as "[[Odd-Eyes Pendulumgraph Dragon]]", can also see play.

  Other cards often found in "Voiceless Voice" decks include:
  * "[[Diviner of the Herald]]", "[[Trias Hierarchia]]", "[[Herald of the Arc Light]]": "Diviner" can send "Trias Hierarchia" from the Deck to the GY. The latter can then Tribute "Diviner", allowing the Special Summon of "Lo" from the Deck. If "Trias Hierarchia" is already available, "Herald of the Arc Light" can be sent to search for a Ritual Card.
  * "[[Nadir Servant]]", "[[Dogmatika Maximus]]", cards in Extra Deck with GY effects: "Voiceless Voice" does not need the Extra Deck, allowing them to use the "Nadir Servant" package to gain advantage.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Being able to stop "Lo" from getting on the field will disable certain "Voiceless Voice" cards. Using cards like "[[D.D. Crow]]" and "[[Bystial]]s" on "Lo's" GY Summon effect may be devastating (assuming another copy of "Lo" can't be summoned).

  ==Trivia==
  * The artwork of "Voiceless Voice" monsters features mosaic pattern in their background, as a homage to the original "[[Skull Guardian]]" that has similar pattern in the background.
