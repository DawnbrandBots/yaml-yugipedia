  "'''Kuriboh'''" (クリボー ''Kuribō'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Monster Card|monsters]] used throughout the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' franchise. With the exception of "[[Performapal Barokuriboh]]", they are all [[Level]]/[[Link Rating|Link]]-1 monsters, and most of them have 300 [[ATK]]/200 [[DEF]], with some cards even supporting this specific combination of [[original ATK and DEF]]. With the exception of [[Junkuriboh]] and [[Linkuriboh]], they are all Fiend or Fairy Effect-type monsters. This archetype also contains the "[[Winged Kuriboh (archetype)|Winged Kuriboh]]" sub-archetype.

  == Appearances ==
  In the anime, "Kuriboh" monsters are notable for being the Spirit partners of the main characters. A few episodes point out that "Kuriboh" monsters have special connections to the main characters who own various versions of this card.
  [[File:Yami and Kuriboh.png|thumb|left|[[Yami Yugi]] with "[[Kuriboh (character)|Kuriboh]]"]]
  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'', [[Yugi Muto]] started with "[[Kuriboh (anime)|Kuriboh]]", which he could [[discard]] to reduce [[Battle damage]] that he would take from his opponent to 0 as well as use "[[Multiply]]" to protect him from battle. His manga counterpart uses "[[Clear Kuriboh (anime)|Clear Kuriboh]]" in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions]]''. He can discard it to negate a damage-dealing monster effect or banish it from the Graveyard to potentially prevent a direct attack.
  <div style="float:right">[[File:Winged Kuriboh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jaden Yuki]] with his spirit partner, "[[Winged Kuriboh (character)|Winged Kuriboh]]"]]</div>

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'', [[Jaden Yuki]]'s Deck includes a "[[Winged Kuriboh (anime)|Winged Kuriboh]]" that he received from Yugi. His Kuriboh strategy focuses on Summoning "[[Winged Kuriboh LV10 (anime)|Winged Kuriboh LV10]]" with "[[Transcendent Wings (anime)|Transcendent Wings]]" and [[Tribute|Tributing]] it to wipe out the opponent's [[Attack Position]] monsters and inflict damage. His manga counterpart also has "[[Winged Kuriboh LV9 (manga)|Winged Kuriboh LV9]]", which restricts the use of [[Spell Card]]s. When his "Winged Kuriboh" is destroyed, all Battle Damage he takes that turn becomes 0.

  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' manga, [[Yusei Fudo (manga)|Yusei]] uses "[[Junkuriboh (manga)|Junkuriboh]]" in his Deck. He can discard it to negate any damage that would make his [[LP]] zero and destroy that card. In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, [[Luna]] uses [[Kuribon]], a Kuriboh-alike monster that can make any [[attack]] damage inflicted in battle with Kuribon zero.

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'', [[Yuma Tsukumo]] obtains "[[Rainbow Kuriboh (anime)|Rainbow Kuriboh]]" during his time in [[Astral World]], which was his [[Kazuma Tsukumo|father]]'s card, and quickly forms a bond with it.

  While no "Kuriboh" monsters make an appearance in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime, the manga features [[Yuya Sakaki (manga)|Yuya Sakaki]] using "[[Performapal Kuriborder (manga)|Performapal Kuribohble]]", which prevents a direct attack, negates battle damage, and recovers life equal to the negated damage, as well as the two Pendulum Monsters "[[EnterMate ClassiKuriboh (manga)|Performapal Classikuriboh]]" and "[[EnterMate BaroKuriboh|Performapal Barokuriboh]]".

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]'', even though he does not use it in his [[Main Deck]], [[Yusaku Fujiki]] used three copies of "[[Sphere Kuriboh]]" as shields during his infiltration of [[SOL Technologies]]' data bank. He later obtains "[[Linkuriboh]]", which reduces the ATK of an opponent's attacking monster to 0 until the end of that turn, by Tributing "Linkuriboh". When [[Ai]] starts Dueling on his own, he uses a darker version of "Linkuriboh" called "[[Linguriboh]]".

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS]]'', [[Yuga Ohdo]] uses three "[[Kuribot (anime)|Kuribot]]", which can retrieve one another from Yuga's Graveyard to refill his hand.

  ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GO RUSH]]'' would be the first media era where no new "Kuriboh" monster would debut in either the anime, manga, or even the physical card game packs (beyond an enhanced form of "Kuribot", "[[Bikuribot]]" in 2024). However, [[Yuga Ohdo]], would continue to use his trusty "Kuribot" in various Duels after being sent back to the past and going by "That Guy".

  == Playing style ==
  "Kuriboh" monsters are generally defensive in nature, and on their own, they tend to prevent [[battle damage]] from occurring to the user. However, some of their support cards allow them to rapidly turn the tables upon the opponent, such as the powerful "[[Winged Kuriboh LV10]]" and "[[Detonate]]". So far, all non-monster support cards for "Kuriboh" monsters are [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s allowing them to function quickly in a themed Deck.
  The monster "[[Dystopia the Despondent]]" works very well with "Kuriboh" decks as a majority of them are level 1.
