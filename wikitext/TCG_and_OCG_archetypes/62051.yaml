  "'''Reptilianne'''", known as "'''Reptiless'''" (レプティレス ''Reputiresu'') in the Japanese version and "'''Reptile'''" during their first appearance in the dubbed anime, is an [[archetype]] of [[Reptile]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Misty Tredwell]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]''. 
  This archetype's members are [[DARK]] monsters (with the exception of the [[WATER]] "[[Reptilianne Gardna]]") that focus on reducing the opponent's monsters' [[ATK]] to 0, using defensive effects to maintain field presence, and taking advantage of monsters whose ATK is 0. The theme and strategy of this archetype is similar to those of the "[[Gorgonic]]" archetype.
  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  Most "Reptilianne" monsters resemble feminine snake-people or pseudo-reptiles in appearance.
  === Etymology ===
  Most "Reptilianne" monsters are named after mythological reptilian and snake-like creatures, often from Indian or Greek mythology. The rest are named after real-life snakes.

  ==Playing style==
  In an offensive "Reptilianne" Deck, the effects of most of the "Reptilianne" monsters will deal with draining the ATK of opposing monsters. First, a card like "[[Reptilianne Naga]]" is used to reduce a monster's ATK to 0. This is followed up with "[[Reptilianne Scylla]]"/"[[Reptilianne Vaskii]]" to gain field advantage, or "[[KA-2 Des Scissors]]"/"[[Masked Chopper]]" to deal great damage. Alternately, "[[Reptilianne Viper]]", a Level 2 Tuner, can take your opponent's 0-ATK monster for a Synchro Summon, and when combined with "[[Reptilianne Spawn]]", will allow you to easily Synchro Summon for almost any Level. "[[Reptilianne Gardna]]" and "[[Oshaleon]]" are used to recruit whichever Reptiles you need. "[[Dark Eruption]]" and "[[Viper's Rebirth]]" quickly retrieve spent "[[Reptilianne Naga|Nagas]]", "[[Reptilianne Gorgon|Gorgons]]", and "[[Reptilianne Medusa|Medusas]]" for a quick ATK drain. "[[Recurring Nightmare]]" brings "[[Reptilianne Vaskii|Vaskii]]" and "[[Reptilianne Naga|Naga]]" back for re-use or to fulfill the Summoning requirements of "[[Dark Armed Dragon]]".
  Another Deck uses "[[Vennominon the King of Poisonous Snakes]]" and "[[Rise of the Snake Deity]]". When "Vennominon" is destroyed by an effect, you can bring out "[[Vennominaga the Deity of Poisonous Snakes]]". You can then use the effects of "Reptilianne" cards to reduce the ATK of opposing monsters to 0, creating openings for "Vennominaga" to inflict damage and gain [[Hyper-Venom Counter]]s. "[[Reptilianne Naga]]" and "[[Reptilianne Gardna]]" can tank attacks while you set up "Rise of the Snake Deity". "[[Limit Reverse]]" and "[[Viper's Rebirth]]" revive "Vennominon" and trigger "Rise of the Snake Deity", or you can Tribute Summon it with "[[Reptilianne Spawn]]" and follow up with "[[Offering to the Snake Deity]]" to clear the field. "[[Limit Reverse]]" can also revive "Naga" for ramming, and "Viper's Rebirth" triggers the effect of "Gardna" quickly. You can take advantage of damage you receive with "[[Damage = Reptile]]", or block it with "[[Spirit Barrier]]".

  ===Weaknesses===
  Reducing your opponent's monster to 0 ATK with "Gorgon" or "Naga" is usually damaging to your Life Points (without help from [[Spirit Barrier]] or something similar). Furthermore, the archetype has few options against a [[Burn]] Deck that does not use monsters, aside from giving the opponent Tokens for "[[Masked Chopper]]" to destroy.
