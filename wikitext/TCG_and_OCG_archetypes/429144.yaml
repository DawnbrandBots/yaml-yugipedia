  == Design ==

  === Origin ===
  The archetype's OCG name, "バージェストマ" (Burgesstoma), is derived from the [[wikipedia:Burgess Shale|Burgess Shale]], where the animals the archetype derived its appearance from were found.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Paleozoic" archetype is mainly composed of Normal Trap Cards. Each one have its particular effect but they have in common the capacity of Special Summoning themselves from the Graveyard as a Level 2 WATER Aqua Normal Monster with 1200 ATK and 0 DEF whenever a Trap Card is activated, thus allowing them to quickly swarm the field through normal usage of their own Trap Effects. The archetype's ace cards are their Xyz monsters, namely "[[Paleozoic Anomalocaris]]" and "[[Paleozoic Opabinia]]".

  "Anomalocaris" helps to maintain hand advantage by excavating the Deck and adding an excavated Trap Card to the hand (be it a "Paleozoic" Card or not); this effect triggers when a Trap Card is sent from the Spell/Trap Zone to the Graveyard. "Opabinia" speeds up the Deck's strategy, by allowing "Paleozoic" cards from being activated directly from the hand. Both of them are unaffected by other monster's effects and have an additional effect that basically rewards their owner for using them in a dedicated "Paleozoic" Deck, by either destroying a troublesome card on the field or fetching a "Paleozoic" Card from the Deck.

  The archetype's Trap Cards banish themselves when they leaves the field after being Summoned from the Graveyard by their own effects, which can be avoided by using them as Xyz Materials. Thus, the archetype also benefits from utilizing other Rank 2 Xyz Monsters such as "[[Armored Kappa]]" and "[[Sky Cavalry Centaurea]]" in concert with "Anomalocaris" and "Opabinia". As the archetype's Trap Cards are all Level 2 WATER Aqua monsters while they are treated as monsters, "[[Wetlands]]" can be included in the Deck to give these cards a much needed power boost, as they all have low ATK, which can raise issues regarding their ability to survive on the field.

  The Deck itself also has amazing synergy with the Frog engine, mainly "[[Swap Frog]]", "[[Dupe Frog]]" and "[[Ronintoadin]]" since they are also Level 2 Aqua monsters. Due to this, and the fact that the Paleozoic cards themselves are treated as Aqua monsters while on the field, they can play the Rank 2 Xyz "[[Toadally Awesome]]".

  Due to their capability of accumulating chain, you can also consider adding some cards like  "[[Accumulated Fortune]]" and  "[[Miraculous Rebirth]]". While somewhat slow, "[[Mask of Darkness]]" can still be used to recycle some Paleozoic cards and in a bigger extent, also be used as a Xyz Material."[[Magical Hats]]" will search 2 Paleozoic cards from your Deck while letting you Summon another from your GY. "[[Justi-Break]]" will protect your Paleozoic cards and potentially clean the field while letting you summon another Paleozoic card from your GY.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The key weakness of "Paleozoic" Decks is its slowness; to accumulate card advantage and resources, player must sent large numbers of cards to the [[Graveyard]] in order to use certain effects and summon "Paleozoic" traps as monsters to protect themselves. As such, the Deck performs poorly when it is unable to perform a mill to send cards to GY, or is being forced to go second and offer little to no interruption to the opponent.
  * Due to the Deck is entirely reliant on accumulating cards to be summoned as monsters later on, anti-GY floodgates such as "[[Necrovalley]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]", or "[[Dimension Shifter]]" can effectively shut down the Deck.
  * The archetype is mainly dependent on activating set Trap Cards to trigger their "Paleozoic" Traps' effects to Special Summon themselves from the Graveyard. As such, anti-Trap floodgates such as "[[Denko Sekka]]" or "[[Jinzo]]" can be used against the Deck.
  * Since each "Paleozoic" trap monsters has low stats, the Deck often struggle to push for final blow, especially when opponent has monster with high stats on the field. Because of this, the Deck is mostly reliant on using "[[Destructive Daruma Karma Cannon]]" or the effect of "[[Elemental Burst]]" copied by "[[Transaction Rollback]]" to deal with them.
