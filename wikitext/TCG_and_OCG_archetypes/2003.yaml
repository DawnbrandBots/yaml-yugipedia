  "'''Elemental HERO'''" ({{Ruby|Ｅ・ＨＥＲＯ|エレメンタルヒーロー}} ''Erementaru Hīrō'') is a "[[HERO]]" sub-[[archetype]] of mostly [[Warrior]] monsters used by both [[Jaden Yuki]] and [[Aster Phoenix]] (for a period of time until the latter changed to the "[[Destiny HERO]]" archetype) in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. The former also used this archetype, along with his mentor [[Koyo Hibiki]], in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' manga. They are used by [[Fusion Mask]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL]] manga.
  They were designed by [[Kazuki Takahashi]], and are based on comic-book superheroes in the anime and on natural elements in the manga.

  "Elemental HERO" Decks focus heavily on [[Fusion Summon]]ing. Most of these fall into two primary categories of the archetype's monsters: the anime-original members (whose Fusion Monsters that [[mentions|mention]] named [[Fusion Material]]s), and manga (whose [[Fusion Monster]]s require generic [[Fusion Material]]s, sans "[[Elemental HERO Terra Firma]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Inferno]]").

  == Design ==
  The "Elemental HERO" monsters are based after the western comics' superheroes, and as the name implies, they each represent an aspect of nature. This goes beyond only representing classical elements like earth, fire or water; "[[Elemental HERO Wildheart]]", for example, represents the wilderness. Their [[Fusion Monster]]s typically combine the aspects from their [[Fusion Material]]s.

  In the ''[[OCG]]'', all of the [[Main Deck]] monsters introduced in the anime, except "[[Elemental HERO Neos]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Prisma|Prisma]]", follow the naming scheme "Elemental HERO [Term related to its element] Man" (or "Lady", in the case of "[[Elemental HERO Burstinatrix]]" aka "Burst Lady"). In the manga, only "[[Elemental HERO Woodsman]]" ("Forestman" in the ''OCG'') and "[[Elemental HERO Stratos|Stratos]]" ("Airman" in the ''OCG'') follow the scheme while others like "[[Elemental HERO Ice Edge|Ice Edge]]" or "[[Elemental HERO Heat|Heat]]" do not. "[[Elemental HERO Captain Gold]]" is unique to the ''OCG''/''TCG'' and doesn't follow the naming scheme, but later cards like "[[Elemental HERO Blazeman|Blazeman]]", "[[Elemental HERO Solid Soldier|Solid Soldier]]" ("Solidman") and "[[Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier|Liquid Soldier]]" ("Liquidman") do.

  === Attribute Fusions ===
  A small series of "Elemental HERO" monsters (often referred to unofficially as the Omni HEROs) whose materials are their respective [[Attribute]] as well as an "Elemental HERO" monster (any "HERO" monster in the case of "Absolute Zero"). In the manga, "[[Elemental Hero Inferno (manga)|Elemental HERO Inferno]]" was part of this grouping, however its release in the OCG preceded the other members of this series and it was made different from them, resulting in the later "Nova Master" being made to supplant it.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Elemental HERO" archetype has many [[Main Deck]] monsters and [[Extra Deck]] [[Fusion Monster]]s, each with their own varied effects. Historically, the archetype can be built to focus on their Main Deck monsters or their Fusion Monsters; currently, the Main Deck "Elemental HERO" monsters are too weak in contrast to the general power level of the game, and later "Elemental HERO" support leaned into their [[Fusion Summon]]ing playstyle more favorably.

  The pure "Elemental HERO" playstyle aims to Fusion Summon their Extra Deck Fusion boss monsters by [[search]]ing out their required [[Fusion Material]]s and "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]"/"[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" [[Spell Card]]s as quickly as possible. This can be done through a combination of specific "Elemental HERO" support cards (e.g. "[[A Hero Lives]]" and "[[E - Emergency Call]]"), generic "[[HERO]]" support cards (e.g. "[[Elemental HERO Stratos]]", "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]" and "[[Vision HERO Vyon]]"), and non-archetypal [[Warrior]] support cards (e.g. "[[Reinforcement of the Army]]"). The original "[[Polymerization]]" [[Normal Spell Card]] in particular is the most used "Fusion"/"Polymerization" Spell since it can be directly searched by a few "HERO" monsters: "[[Elemental HERO Blazeman]]", "[[Elemental HERO Spirit of Neos]]", "[[Elemental HERO Woodsman]]" and "Vision HERO Vyon".

  The "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monsters typically have battle-focused effects with little defensive capabilities. Most "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monsters also require Fusion Materials with specific names, but some of them have more generic [[material]]s, thus are much easier to summon. The 6 most notable ones are "[[Elemental HERO Great Tornado|Great Tornado]]", "[[Elemental HERO Nova Master|Nova Master]]", "[[Elemental HERO The Shining|The Shining]]", "[[Elemental HERO Escuridao|Escuridao]]", "[[Elemental HERO Absolute Zero|Absolute Zero]]", and "[[Elemental HERO Gaia|Gaia]]", which require 1 "Elemental HERO" monster and a monster with a specific [[Attribute]] as their materials, making them useful choices to summon with "[[Super Polymerization]]" by using an opponent's monster as material. Among these 6, "Escuridao" and "Absolute Zero" are the most commonly used, because "Escuridao's" [[DARK]] Attribute is ubiquitous when mixed with other "HERO" monsters, and "Absolute Zero" has a very strong effect, and also only requires a "HERO" monster rather than an "Elemental HERO" monster as its material, making it even easier to Summon in a general "HERO" [[Deck]]. Following behind are "[[Elemental HERO Sunrise]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage]]" whose materials can make use of the varying Attributes of "Elemental HERO" monsters and they both have effects to search out yet another card that can Summon another "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monster ("[[Miracle Fusion]]" and "[[Favorite Contact]]"). "[[Wake Up Your Elemental HERO]]" is the archetype's powerhouse that requires any number of Warrior monsters and an "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monster, which can easily use close out games with its powerful attacks and can float into any Warrior monster from the Deck upon its destruction.

  An "Elemental HERO" Deck can consider running "[[King of the Swamp]]" (which can also search the original "Polymerization") and other [[Fusion Substitute Monster]]s for "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monsters with specific materials.

  === With "Neos" and "Neo-Spacian" ===
  {{See also|[[Neo-Spacian#Playing style]]}}

  While "[[Elemental HERO Neos]]" is featured as a main piece of the "[[Neo-Spacian]]" and "[[Neos]]" archetypes that usually uses [[Contact Fusion]] or other effects to Special Summon the Fusion Monsters that mention "Elemental HERO Neos" as material, differing from the traditional Fusion Summon playstyle of "Elemental HERO" in general. Over time however, the "[[Neos]]"/"Neo-Spacian" theme has been integrated with the traditional "Elemental HERO" Fusion Summon playstyle by the introduction of newer support. These include: "[[Cross Keeper]]", the "EN" cards ("[[EN - Engage Neo Space]]", "[[EN Shuffle]]" and "[[EN Wave]]") and new "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monsters that must be Fusion Summoned such as "[[Elemental HERO Brave Neos]]", "[[Elemental HERO Neos Knight]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Shining Neos Wingman]]". In particular, "Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage" facilitates the Summon of "Elemental HERO Shining Neos Wingman" by searching "Favorite Contact" which can Summon "Neos Wingman" during the opponent's turn to disrupt the opponent.

  "[[Elemental HERO Spirit of Neos]]" can search "Polymerization" or a Spell/Trap that mentions an "Elemental HERO" monster upon its Special Summon, which facilitates easier use of the niche classic "Elemental HERO" support. Then it can tag itself out with an "Elemental HERO" Normal Monster from the Deck. These effects in tandem grant easy access to use the "Elemental HERO" Normal Monsters-oriented cards (like the [[Counter Trap Card]] "[[Feather Wind]]", which negates the activation of a Spell/Trap Card with "[[Elemental HERO Avian]]"), though it will usually search most of the "Elemental HERO Neos"-oriented cards or "[[Protection of the Elements]]" (another Counter Trap Card which can negate the activation of a Spell/Trap Card by using any "Elemental HERO" monster for its activation requirements as opposed to "Feather Wind" requiring "Elemental HERO Avian" specifically).

  === Other "HERO" support ===
  Within the entire "[[HERO]]" meta-archetype, the "Elemental HERO" archetypal playstyle is strongly supported by the "[[Vision HERO]]" combo ("[[Vision HERO Faris|Faris]]" → "[[Vision HERO Increase|Increase]]" → "[[Vision HERO Vyon|Vyon]]") since "Vyon" can search out "[[Polymerization]]" and can [[send]] "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]" to the [[GY]] to search out more needed "Elemental HERO" monsters. The "Vision HERO" [[Fusion Monster]]s, "[[Vision Hero Adoration|Adoration]]" and "[[Vision HERO Trinity|Trinity]]", are also good options for an "Elemental HERO" Deck to run due to their generic Fusion [[Material]]s of just any "HERO" monsters.

  The "[[Xtra HERO]]" [[Link Monster]]s provide many helpful benefits to the "Elemental HERO" playstyle. "[[Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer|Infernal Devicer]]" can directly search out up to 2 specific [[Fusion Material]]s [[mentions|mentioned]] on a "HERO" Fusion Monster, making it most strongly support the "Elemental HERO", "[[Neos]]"/"[[Neo-Spacian]]" and "[[Evil HERO]]" playstyles of utilizing Fusion Monsters with specific materials. "[[Xtra HERO Wonder Driver|Wonder Driver]]" can recover "Polymerization" and "Fusion" [[Spell Card]]s, making it useful for longer combos or grind games.

  "[[Evil HERO Infernal Rider]]" grants "Elemental HERO" decks access to "Super Polymerization" to disrupt the opponent by fusing one of their monsters as material (for fusing the omni-"Elemental HERO" Fusions). Meanwhile, "[[Evil HERO Dead-End Prison]]" can opt as a temporary Fusion Substitute monster, easing the Fusion Summon requirements of "Elemental HERO" Fusions that require specific materials.

  === How "Elemental HERO" supports other "HERO" sub-archetypes ===
  On the other side, the "Elemental HERO" archetype (specifically, a few individual members) are vital combo pieces to the overall "[[HERO]]" meta-archetype playstyle. The most important "Elemental HERO" monster with regards to the entire "HERO" archetype is "[[Elemental HERO Stratos]]", a non-once-per-turn searcher for all "HERO" monsters and the ideal choice for "[[A Hero Lives]]". "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]" is a once-per-turn searcher for all "HERO" monsters when [[sent]] to the [[GY]] (usually by "[[Vision HERO Vyon]]"), but it is also a searcher for "[[Change]]" [[Spell Card]]s, which enables the [[Special Summon]] of the powerful "[[Masked HERO]]" monsters (most notably "[[Masked HERO Dark Law|Dark Law]]" and "[[Masked HERO Acid|Acid]]", the former can be Summoned using the wide pool of DARK "HERO" monsters available including "Shadow Mist" herself while the latter is Summoned by using "Absolute Zero" to perform a board wipe). The variety of [[Attribute]]s the "Elemental HERO" monsters have makes them ideal for summoning "Masked HERO" monsters with "[[Mask Change]]" or "[[Mask Change II]]" while the Levels of "Masked HERO" Fusion Monsters align with those of "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monsters for "[[Form Change]]", making "Masked HERO" monsters good options even in a pure "Elemental HERO" build. In return, "Masked HERO" monsters themselves can be fused together for "[[Contrast HERO Chaos]]" for its useful Quick Effect to negate a card's effects on the field.

  "[[Elemental HERO Solid Soldier]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier|Liquid Soldier]]" are good monsters to [[Normal Summon]], as they can [[Special Summon]] needed "HERO" monsters (usually "Shadow Mist" to search for "[[Mask Change]]") and/or provide useful advantage after being used for a Fusion Summon (reviving a "HERO" monster from the GY via "Solid Soldier" or allows [[Draw a card|drawing of 2 cards]] + a discard with "Liquid Soldier"). Lastly, "[[Elemental HERO Honest Neos|Honest Neos]]" is an [[ATK]]-booster for all "HERO" monsters, and "[[Elemental HERO Sunrise|Sunrise]]" is a [[Fusion Monster]] with generic "HERO" [[Fusion Material]]s that can search out "[[Miracle Fusion]]", a powerful Fusion Spell Card that can use monsters in the [[GY]] as Fusion Materials, allowing a Fusion Summon with zero card loss to the [[field]] advantage. "Wake Up Your Elemental HERO" requires an "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monster and any number of Warrior monsters (ie. the vast majority of the "HERO" archetype) which can be used to close out games with its high ATK and its attacking-oriented effects, or be destroyed to Special Summon another "HERO" monster from the Deck.

  Most "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters also require specific "Elemental HERO" monsters as their Fusion Materials, which can be aided with the aforementioned "Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer".

  ==== Classic ====
  This Deck list focuses on the playstyle of "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monsters that require specific Fusion Materials featured prominently in the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' anime. While it is outclassed by the current power level of the game, this playstyle still received various modern pieces of support, namely "Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer" and greatly benefits from the "Vision HERO" engine involving "Vision HERO Faris", "Vision HERO Increase" and "Vision HERO Vyon". After searching "Polymerization" with "Vyon", both itself and "Increase" can be used to Link Summon "Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer" which help easily search the pair of Fusion Materials needed. Alternatively, one could use the searched "Polymerization" instead to Fusion Summon more generic choices, more notably "Elemental HERO Sunrise" or "Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage" which can search cards to Summon yet another "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monster from the Extra Deck.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "Elemental HERO" monsters often lack protection, and as such the player can often easily have their [[field]] cleared by mass destruction cards and effects like "[[Dark Hole]]", "[[Raigeki]]" and "[[Evenly Matched]]".
  * Pure "Elemental HERO" monsters have very weak disruption and oppression power, having little ability to disrupt or prevent the opponent's plays.
  * "[[Gozen Match]]" can significantly disrupt a pure "Elemental HERO" Deck due to their variety of [[Attribute]]s.
  * As all "Elemental HERO" non-[[Contact Fusion|Contact]] Fusion Monsters [[Nomi|cannot be]] [[Special Summon]]ed in other ways than [[Fusion Summon]], cards like "[[Non-Fusion Area]]" and "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" can prevent these Fusion Monsters from being Summoned easily. Furthermore, cards like "[[Nekroz of Unicore]]" can have their effects negated.
  * As "Elemental HERO" monsters are mostly Warrior-Type, cards such as "[[Cipher Soldier]]", "[[Warrior Elimination]]" and "[[There Can Be Only One]]" can pose as a threat to such decks.
