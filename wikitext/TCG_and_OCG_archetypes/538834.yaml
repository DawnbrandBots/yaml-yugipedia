  "'''Ojama'''" (おジャマ, ''Ojama'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Beast]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Chazz Princeton]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. The [[Ojama Trio (character)|Ojama Brothers]] also served as his primary [[Duel Monster Spirits|spirit partners]].
  While not having "Ojama" in its card name, "[[Ojamuscle]]" is treated as an "Ojama" card because it has 「おジャマ」 in its Japanese name. "Ojamuscle" was eventually given errata in the TCG to give it an "Ojama" [[archetype condition]].
  Some "Ojama" cards also support LIGHT [[Machine]] [[Fusion Monster]]s and the "[[Armed Dragon]]" archetype. This is a homage to Chazz, who used the "Ojama" archetype alongside the [[A-to-Z]] and "Armed Dragon" monsters.

  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  "Ojama" monsters are humanoid creatures with large, pronounced and characteristic facial features. Each member wears a floral red bikini brief, including "[[Ojama Knight]]" who wears his over his armor.
  Six unknown "Ojama" creatures appear in the artwork of "[[Ojama Country]]": a spiky flying light yellow "Ojama", a flat purple "Ojama", a fat lime green "Ojama", a spiky grey "Ojama", along with what appears to be a snake and a dog. The skeletal remains of some of these creatures appear in the artwork of "[[Solidarity]]".
  ===Commonalities===
  The original "[[Ojama Trio]]" are often used as the butt of humor on several card illustrations, such as being hunted down on "[[Harpies' Hunting Ground]]", being tossed by "[[Man-Thro' Tro']]", being used to practice boxing in "[[Ojamuscle]]", flattened on "[[Power Filter]]", falling into the canyon shown on "[[Nitwit Outwit]]", chased down by a shark in “[[Painful Decision]]”, etc..
  All "Ojama" [[Monster Card|monster]]s have 0 [[ATK]]. Many "Ojama" cards fill up or prevent the use of the opponent's [[Monster Card Zone]]s. There are three [[Main Deck]] "Ojama" [[Effect Monster]]s, "[[Ojama Red|Red]]", "[[Ojama Blue|Blue]]", and "[[Ojama Pink|Pink]]" who help the archetype in general.
  ===Etymology===
  The name "Ojama" comes from the Japanese phrase ''Ojamashimasu'' (お邪魔します), which literally means "I am intruding" but is used to mean "sorry for the intrusion". It is usually used as a greeting when entering someone's house or room. "[[Ojama Trio]]" could be a reference to this, which has the Ojamas barge onto the opponent's field. Their name could also come from the word "Jama", which means "obstacle" in Japanese. The term "Jama" is also used to describe something or someone that is a nuisance or "in the way".
  According to the famous [[Konami]] detective game, ''[[wikipedia:Snatcher (video game)|Snatcher]]'', "Ojama" is also the nickname of [[wikipedia:Hideo Kojima|Hideo Kojima]], the game's creator and director.<ref>{{cite web |title=Snatcher Easter Egg (Kojima Reference) - YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZewyy4BFKk |website=YouTube |accessdate=October 9, 2020 |date=May 3, 2010}}</ref>
  ==Playing style==
  The main focus of the "Ojamas" is to generate hand advantage with cards like "[[Ojamagic]]" and use it to either fill the field with "[[Ojama Red]]" or use them as Fusion Material for their Fusion Monsters. They have low ATK and high DEF, but this can be fixed using their Field Spell, "[[Ojama Country]]", which swaps all monsters' ATK and DEF and can revive an "Ojama" from the GY. "[[Ojama Blue]]" is crucial for the Deck, as it can search any 2 "Ojama" cards, but must be destroyed by battle to do so; one way to search more cards quickly involves attacking a stronger monster with it and searching "Ojamagic" and "[[Ojamatch]]", then discarding the former to activate the latter and search another "Blue", which is then immediately Normal Summoned during the Battle Phase.

  The Deck's "classic" playstyle involves preventing the opponent from Summoning any monsters, by using the effects of "[[Ojama King]]" and "[[Ojama Knight]]" to prevent their [[Monster Zone]]s from being used, plus "[[Ojama Trio]]" and "[[Ojama Duo]]" filling their field with useless Tokens. Unfortunately, the release of Link Monsters means the Tokens can be quickly removed by using them as Link Material, but it's still possible to complete the lockdown.

  The archetype's swarming capabilities also allow them to Summon powerful [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]], [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] and [[Link Monster]]s to the field. Because "Ojamatch" and "[[Ojamassimilation]]" link the archetype to the "[[Armed Dragon]]" and "[[A-to-Z]]" archetypes, "Ojama" Decks frequently include some monsters from those archetypes, either to further swarm the field or to Summon the powerful "[[Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon]]".

  ===Ojama Link Beatdown===
  This Deck takes full advantage of the archetype's swarming capabilities by eschewing its traditional boss monsters in favor of powerful, generic Extra Deck monsters to clear the opponent's field. "Ojamassimilation" is an especially useful extender; revealing "[[ABC-Dragon Buster]]" and Summoning its materials can result in a Link-4 monster on its own, by first using "[[A-Assault Core]]" and "[[B-Buster Drake]]" as material, returning "B-Buster Drake" to the hand, then using "[[C-Crush Wyvern]]" as material to Summon it from the hand again and using it as a fourth material.

  Since the archetype consists of [[Beast]] monsters, it can potentially synergize with "[[Tri-Brigade]]" monsters, but players must keep in mind that if any of them use their effects to banish and Summon a Link Monster, or use the effect of "[[Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom]]", they will be unable to use the "ABC" components as Link Material for the rest of the turn.

  ===Ojama Lockdown===
  This Deck focuses on the lockdown aspect that the archetype was originally known for. To do so, it supplements the abilities of their Fusions with other cards that restrict zones, such as "[[Ground Collapse]]" and "[[Zany Zebra]]". "[[Instant Fusion]]" is particularly useful as it properly Summons "[[Ojama Knight]]" from the Extra Deck for free, allowing it to be revived later.

  ===Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon===
  This Deck focuses almost solely on Summoning "[[Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon]]". "Armed Dragon Thunder" monsters can quickly facilitate the "[[Armed Dragon LV7]]" requirement via "[[Armed Dragon Thunder LV7]]" copying that name, and can even level up to "[[Armed Dragon Thunder LV10]]" afterwards for its disruptive effect. One of the materials for "[[VWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon]]" can be sent to the GY with "[[Extra Foolish Burial]]" and equipped to "[[Therion "King" Regulus]]" to use for its [[Contact Fusion]]. In the ''[[OCG]]'', "[[Fusion Tag]]" can be also used to treat any monster as one of the materials, further speeding up the combo. The Deck's heavy focus on the "[[A-to-Z]]" monsters means it can also Summon their other boss monster, "[[A-to-Z-Dragon Buster Cannon]]".

  ===Weaknesses===
  * "[[Deck Devastation Virus]]" can wipe out every "Ojama" monster on the field and in the hand.
  * "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]" shuts down both "[[Ojama Red]]" and "[[Ojama Blue]]", making it difficult for the Deck to get started.
  * "Ojama Red" can be punished by mass-destruction cards like "[[Torrential Tribute]]", "[[Darkfall]]" and "[[Needle Ceiling]]", or prevented outright with anti-Special Summoning effects like "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" or "[[And the Band Played On]]". "[[Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon]]" can also restrict it to Summoning 1 monster from hand.
  * "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" can prevent a player from Summoning "[[ABC-Dragon Buster]]", "[[VWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon]]" or the "Ojama" Fusions for a turn. Similarly, "[[Forbidden Apocrypha]]" will force an Ojama Lockdown player to send all their "Ojama" Fusions to the GY, and can potentially stop a Deck focused around "[[Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon]]" by forcing them to send "[[VW-Tiger Catapult]]" and "[[XYZ-Dragon Cannon]]" to the GY before they can Summon "[[VWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon]]".
  * "[[Spellbound]]" can stop almost all the Extra Deck plays this archetype relies on, although the Lockdown variant can still fuse monsters from the hand.
