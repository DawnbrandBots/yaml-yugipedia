  {{Quote|Serve up destruction with a smile!|source=TCG commercial for ''[[Mystic Fighters]]''}}
  "'''Dragonmaid'''" (ドラゴンメイド ''Doragonmeido'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Dragon]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Mystic Fighters]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#The New Cake Designs of the "Dragonmaids"|The Valuable Book EX 5 card storylines#No. 10: The Dragonmaid Caretakers}}

  == Design ==
  ===Appearance===
  The "Dragonmaid" archetype appears to take inspiration from the ''[[wikipedia:Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid|Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid]]'' manga series, which also features the concept of dragons that turn into humanoid maids.

  ===Base===
  The [[Main Deck]] monsters consist of two lineups: Level 2/3/4 humanoid maids, and Level 7/8 dragons. The maids (except "Lady's") are the humanoid versions of the dragons, with every pair sharing the same Attribute (and having a predominant color matching that Attribute) but having a 5-Level difference.

  === Etymology ===
  The "Dragonmaid" monsters' human forms are broadly based on [[wikipedia:Maid#Types|maid classifications]] found in late modern period European domestic worker hierarchies.

  The ''[[OCG]]'' names of the dragon forms are the German names of things associated to their Attributes, whereas in the ''[[TCG]]'' they're simply anagrams of their respective humanoid forms'.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Dragonmaid" archetype revolves around swarming its low-Level members and using their on-summon effects to amass resources during the Main Phase 1, switching them out for their dragon forms during the Battle Phase, and then switching back into the humanoid forms afterwards. The archetype uses self-bouncing and Graveyard recursion as its main methods of gaining card advantage and triggering beneficial effects, has two Extra Deck Fusion boss monsters, and is backed up with many powerful Spells/Traps.
  The low-Level humanoid forms of the "Dragonmaid" monsters each have two effects:
  # ''If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can [On-Summon Effect].''
  # ''At the start of the Battle Phase: You can return this card to the hand, and if you do, Special Summon 1 [high-Level] "Dragonmaid" monster from your hand or GY.''

  |}

  Within these cards, "Chamber" is the archetype's main Spell/Trap searcher. "Parlor" and "Kitchen" are situational card searchers that require setup for maximum effectiveness or otherwise can only send cards to the GY. "Nurse" is an advantage generator that can Special Summon additional "Dragonmaid" monsters (and trigger their effects), and is often summoned and triggered in the opponent's turn. Lastly, "Laundry" is a situational GY setup tool that can theoretically provide significant GY advantage, but at the cost of inconsistency.

  Special Summoning a high-Level "Dragonmaid" monster from the GY with the low-Level "Dragonmaid" monsters' switching effect grants a +1 in card advantage, as they bounce themselves to the hand to do so.
  The high-Level Dragonic forms of the "Dragonmaid" monsters each have three effects:
  # ''Cannot be destroyed by card effects while you control a Fusion Monster.''
  # ''You can discard this card, [Discard Effect]''
  # ''At the end of the Battle Phase: You can return this card to the hand, and if you do, Special Summon 1 [low-Level] "Dragonmaid" monster from your hand.''

  The Dragonic "Dragonmaid" monsters have high statlines, making them the deck's main battle monsters. They are functionally effectless on the field aside from their switching effect, so they also possess discard effects to provide some value in case they're stuck in the player's hand.

  The switching effects of the "Dragonmaid" monsters are generally Level-restricted, meaning that not all of them can switch to all high-level or low-level "Dragonmaid" monsters. Specifically, the Level 2 monsters "Nurse" and "Laundry" can each switch with Level 7 "Nudyarl" or "Ernus", and the Level 3 monsters "Parlor" and "Kitchen" can each switch with the Level 8 monsters "Lorpar" or "Tinkhec". None of the aforementioned Level 7/8 monsters can switch into "Chamber", but it can switch into any of them.

  The pair of "Dragonmaid" Fusion Monsters, "[[House Dragonmaid]]" and "[[Dragonmaid Sheou]]", are the deck's main boss monsters. They can easily be made using a pair of low-Level and/or high-Level "Dragonmaid" monsters, and both have two effects: a Special Summoning effect, and a disruptive effect.

  | 1 "Dragonmaid" + 1 Dragon
  | (OPT) During each Standby Phase, you can target 1 other friendly "Dragonmaid", and Special Summon 1 "Dragonmaid" from hand or GY, whose Level is 1 higher or 1 lower than it.
  | When another face-up friendly Dragon returns to hand, you can target 1 opposing monster and destroy it.
  |-
  | [[Dragonmaid Sheou|Sheou]]
  | 1 "Dragonmaid" + 1 Level 5+ Dragon
  | ([[HOPT]]) During each Standby Phase, you can Special Summon 1 Level 9 or lower "Dragonmaid" from hand or GY.
  | ([[HOPT]]) When your opponent activates a card or effect, you can negate and destroy it, then return this card to the Extra Deck and Special Summon 1 "House Dragonmaid" from Extra Deck.
  |}

  "Sheou" is usually the better target to be Fusion Summoned, as her effects are stronger, more flexible, and she can still turn into "House" if needed. In terms of supportive Spell/Traps, the most important Spells and Traps are "[[Dragonmaid Changeover]]", the archetype's Fusion Spell that can recover itself from GY as an immediate +1, "[[Dragonmaid Hospitality]]", which can Special Summon a "Dragonmaid" monster from hand or GY and then search out another "Dragonmaid" monster with the same Attribute (by milling it), and "[[Dragonmaid Tidying]]", a bounce disruption that also has a GY effect that can Special Summon "Dragonmaid" monsters from hand or GY.
