  "'''Blue-Eyes'''" (ブルーアイズ ''Burūaizu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Dragon]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Seto Kaiba]], [[Kaibaman (character)|Kaibaman]], [[Paradox]], and [[Roku]]. A mysterious woman named [[Kisara]] carries the spirit of the "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]" as revealed in both the anime and manga.

  Though members have existed since the ''[[Starter Box: Theatrical Release]]'' in 1999, it only received its first explicit [[support]] in 2015 with the release of "[[Priestess with Eyes of Blue]]".

  == Design ==
  Most "Blue-Eyes" monsters closely resemble the original "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]", as all monsters in this archetype are either [[retrained]] [[counterpart]]s, downgraded, or [[Card evolutions|upgraded]] forms of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". The With Eyes of Blue monsters are based on the four people who carried the spirit of "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]" in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime, included [[Kisara]].

  === Ultimate Dragon ===
  "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" has multiple Fusion counterparts, the most well known being the Level 12 Ultimate Dragon Fusions. Visually, they are three-headed evolved counterparts of their base forms. Most of these monsters are Fusion Summoned using three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons", similar to the original "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]". 

  The only Ultimate Dragon that  cannot be Fusion Summoned is "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Spirit Dragon]]", which is a [[Synchro monster]], but it can be Special Summoned by using the effect of its Base Counterpart, "[[Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon]]".

  === Dragon Master ===

  In the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|original anime]], "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]" was used as a Fusion Material along with "[[Black Luster Soldier]]" for a monster named "[[Dragon Master Knight]]". In the ''OCG''/''TCG'', a retrained counterpart of this monster was also released: "[[Dragon Master Magia]]", which uses "[[Magician of Black Chaos]]" as its visual Fusion Material.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Blue-Eyes" archetype centers on the Level 8 LIGHT Dragon Normal Monster, "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]", swarming the field with copies of it, and/or using it to create various Main Deck or Extra Deck boss monsters. Many support cards in the Main Deck mention the original "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" specifically, whereas in the Extra Deck only the Fusion monsters require the original "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" rather than a "Blue-Eyes" monster or more generic materials.

  Game-plan-wise, the archetype's boss monsters can be broadly divided by their card types.
  * Main Deck non-Ritual: They generally have field control or supportive effects, and help get Level 8 and 10 "Blue-Eyes" monsters on field to use for Ritual/Fusion/Synchro/Xyz/Link plays. "[[Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Solid Dragon]]" and "[[Dragon Spirit of White]]" are likely the best ones, but "[[Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon]]", "[[Deep-Eyes White Dragon]]" and "[[Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon]]" are included too.
  * Ritual: Consisting of "[[Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon]]" and "[[Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon]]", they are both Level 8 Ritual Monsters that focus on performing [[OTK]]s by dealing massive [[piercing]] damage, while having a protective effect that prevents them from being targeted or destroyed by the opponent's card effects. They synergize with the Ritual Spell "[[Chaos Form]]".
  * Fusion: Consisting of "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon]]", "[[Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon]]" and "[[Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon]]", they require 2 or 3 "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" as materials. They focus on performing [[OTK]]s by having large ATK and being able to attack multiple times, and/or focus on controlling the field by having strong protections and the ability to remove opposing cards.
  * Synchro: Consisting of "[[Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon]]" and "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Spirit Dragon]]", they are Level 9 and 12 Synchro Monsters respectively that focus on controlling the field by providing situational floodgating, effect negation, monster protection, and monster revival. "Spirit Dragon" notably can Tribute itself to Special Summon any LIGHT Dragon Synchro Monster from the Extra Deck as a [[Quick Effect]], giving it significant flexibility.
  * Xyz: Only consisting of "[[Indigo-Eyes Silver Dragon]]".
  * Link: Only consisting of "[[Spirit with Eyes of Blue]]".

  The archetype's main lower-level support monsters are all Level 1 LIGHT Tuner monsters, and can be divided into two types: the [[with Eyes of Blue]] Spellcasters, and the "White Stone" Dragons ("[[The White Stone of Ancients]]" and "[[The White Stone of Legend]]"). The "with Eyes of Blue" monsters focus on searching and interacting with Level 1 LIGHT Tuners and Special Summoning "Blue-Eyes" monsters, while the "White Stone" monsters gain advantage when sent to the GY.

  The card attributes that surround "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (Level 8, LIGHT, Dragon, Normal Monster) gives it a large amount of external support, such as "[[Trade-In]]", "[[The Melody of Awakening Dragon]]", "[[Dragon Shrine]]", "[[Dragon Ravine]]", "[[Silver's Cry]]", and "[[Return of the Dragon Lords]]". Also, as it frequently summons Level 8 monsters, it can benefit from the generic [[Rank 8 Monster Cards|Rank 8]] pool.

  === In competitive play ===
  In terms of competitive play, "Blue-Eyes" can be split into two rough categories: Synchro and Chaos MAX.

  Synchro variants aim to go first, gaining field presence with Synchro monsters such as "[[Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Spirit Dragon]]", and other Dragon Synchro monsters like "[[Cosmic Blazar Dragon]]" (summoned using "[[Crimson Dragon]]"). This was the variant that won the World Championships in 2016; it helped that "Spirit Dragon" countered many of the then-meta Decks (its GY negate hurt "[[Burning Abyss]]", the "Neither player can Special Summon 2 or more monsters" effect countered [[Pendulum]]), and that those Decks were nerfed by the Worlds [[World Championship 2016 Lists|banlist]]. With the release of [[Structure Deck: Blue-Eyes White Destiny]], as well as the Normal Monster-supporting "[[Primite]]" engine, this variant gained major support, giving it success in the current meta.

  Chaos MAX variants, meanwhile, focus on an [[OTK]] using the power of "[[Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon]]". "Chaos MAX's" destruction and targeting protection made it a difficult monster to get rid of, giving it some rogue-level success at the time.

  Also, when "[[Dragon Ruler]]s" were dominant, a small Blue-Eyes engine - consisting of "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]", "[[The White Stone of Legend]]", as well as draw cards "[[Trade-In]]" and "[[Cards of Consonance]]" - were sometimes used for advantage. They could be used as discards to supplement "[[Super Rejuvenation]]", banished from the GY to summon the "Dragon Rulers", and possibly summoned with "[[Soul Charge]]" to make Rank 8s.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As an archetype that consists primarily of LIGHT and Dragon monsters, specific Attribute and Type counters, such as "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]" or "[[Bystial]]" monsters as well as "[[Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman]]", can significantly hamper the deck's performance.
  * The original Blue Eyes White Dragon is a key combo card in a majority of the cards from the archetype, so if all of its copies are banished such as by the effects of "Bystial" monsters or "[[Called by the Grave]]" the deck will have a hard time executing its combo.
  * As most of the key cards of this archetype are either high-level monsters or low-level searchers with low stats, the player is likely to have dead draws. The support released in ''[[Structure Deck: Blue-Eyes White Destiny]]'' offers a great boost in consistency, enabling "1-card" and "2-card" combos, though the original "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" remains a brick.
