  "'''Blue-Eyes'''" (ブルーアイズ ''Burūaizu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Dragon]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Seto Kaiba]], [[Kaibaman (character)|Kaibaman]], [[Paradox]], and [[Roku]]. A mysterious woman named [[Kisara]] carries the spirit of the "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]" as revealed in both the anime and manga.

  Though members have existed since the ''[[Starter Box: Theatrical Release]]'' in 1999, it only received its first explicit [[support]] in 2015 with the release of "[[Priestess with Eyes of Blue]]".

  == Design ==
  Most "Blue-Eyes" monsters closely resemble the original "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]", as all monsters in this archetype are either [[retrained]] [[counterpart]]s, downgraded, or [[Card evolutions|upgraded]] forms of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". The With Eyes of Blue monsters are based on the four people who carried the spirit of "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]" in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime, included [[Kisara]].

  === Ultimate Dragon ===
  "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" has multiple Fusion counterparts, the most well known being the Level 12 Ultimate Dragon Fusions. Visually, they are three-headed evolved counterparts of their base forms. Most of these monsters are Fusion Summoned using three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons", similar to the original "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]". 

  The only Ultimate Dragon that  cannot be Fusion Summoned is "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Spirit Dragon]]", which is a [[Synchro monster]], but it can be Special Summoned by using the effect of its Base Counterpart, "[[Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon]]".

  === Dragon Master ===

  In the [[Yu-Gi-Oh!_(anime)|original anime]], "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]" was used as a Fusion material along with "[[Black Luster Soldier]]" for a monster named "[[Dragon Master Knight]]". In the OCG/TCG, a retrained counterpart of this monster is released named "[[Dragon Master Magia]]", which uses "[[Magician of Black Chaos]]" as its visual Fusion material.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Blue-Eyes" archetype centers on the Level 8 LIGHT Dragon Normal Monster, "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]", swarming the field with it, and/or using it to create various Main Deck or Extra Deck boss monsters. Many support cards mention the original "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" specifically, while most in-theme Extra Deck monsters require a "Blue-Eyes" monster or the original "Blue-Eyes White Dragon".

  The archetype's boss monsters can be broadly divided by their card typing: Main Deck non-Ritual, Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link.
  * Main Deck non-Ritual: They generally have field control or supportive effects, and help get Level 8 and 10 "Blue-Eyes" monsters on field to use for Ritual/Fusion/Synchro/Xyz/Link plays. Examples include "[[Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon]]", "[[Dragon Spirit of White]]", "[[Deep-Eyes White Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Solid Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon]]" and "[[Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon]]".
  * Ritual: Consisting of "[[Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon]]" and "[[Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon]]", they are Level 8 Ritual Monsters focus on performing [[OTK]]s by dealing massive [[piercing]] damage, while having a protective effect that prevents them from being targeted or destroyed by the opponent's card effects. They synergize with the Ritual Spell "[[Chaos Form]]".
  * Fusion: Consisting of "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon]]", "[[Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon]]" and "[[Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon]]", they require 2 or 3 "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" as materials. They focus on performing [[OTK]]s by having large ATK and being able to attack multiple times, and/or focus on controlling the field by having strong protections and the ability to remove opposing cards.
  * Synchro: Consisting of "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Spirit Dragon]]" and "[[Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon]]", they are 9 and 12 Synchro Monsters that focus on controlling the field by providing situational floodgating, effect negation, monster protection, and monster revival. "Spirit Dragon" notably can Tribute itself to Special Summon any LIGHT Dragon Synchro Monster from the Extra Deck as a [[Quick Effect]], giving it significant flexibility.
  * Xyz: Only consisting of "[[Indigo-Eyes Silver Dragon]]".
  * Link: Only consisting of "[[Spirit with Eyes of Blue]]".

  The archetype's main lower-level support monsters are all Level 1 LIGHT Tuner monsters, and can be divided into two types: the [[with Eyes of Blue]] Spellcasters, and the "White Stone" Dragons ("[[The White Stone of Ancients]]" and "[[The White Stone of Legend]]"). The "with Eyes of Blue" monsters focus on searching and interacting with Level 1 LIGHT Tuners and Special Summoning "Blue-Eyes" monsters, while the "White Stone" monsters gain advantage when sent to the GY.

  The card attributes that surround "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (Level 8, LIGHT, Dragon, Normal Monster) gives it a large amount of external support, such as "[[Trade-In]]", "[[The Melody of Awakening Dragon]]", "[[Dragon Shrine]]", "[[Dragon Ravine]]", "[[Silver's Cry]]", and "[[Return of the Dragon Lords]]". Also, as it frequently summons Level 8 monsters, it can benefit from the generic [[Rank 8 Monster Cards|Rank 8]] pool.

  === In competitive play ===
  In terms of competitive play, "Blue-Eyes" can be split into two rough categories: Synchro and Chaos MAX:
  * Synchro variants aim to go first and gain field presence with Synchro monsters such as "[[Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Spirit Dragon]]", and other Dragon Synchro monsters like "[[Cosmic Blazar Dragon]]" (summoned using "[[Crimson Dragon]]"). 
  ** This is the variant that won the World Championships in 2016. It helped that "Spirit Dragon" countered many of the then-meta Decks (its GY negate hurt "[[Burning Abyss]]", the "Neither player can Special Summon 2 or more monsters" effect countered [[Pendulum]]), and that those Decks were nerfed by the [[World Championship 2016 Lists|banlist]].
  ** With the release of [[Structure Deck: Advent of the Eyes of Blue]] in the ''[[OCG]]'', as well as the Normal Monster-supporting "[[Primite]]" engine, this variant gained major support, giving it success in the current meta.
  * Chaos MAX variants are an [[OTK]]-focused Deck, using the power of "[[Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon]]" to OTK. At the time, "Chaos MAX's" destruction and targeting protection made it a difficult monster to get rid of, giving it some rogue-level success.

  Also, when "[[Dragon Ruler]]s" were dominant, a small Blue-Eyes engine - consisting of "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]", "[[The White Stone of Legend]]", as well as draw cards "[[Trade-In]]" and "[[Cards of Consonance]]" - were sometimes used for advantage. They could be used as discards to supplement "[[Super Rejuvenation]]", banished from the GY to summon the "Dragon Rulers", and possibly summoned with "[[Soul Charge]]" to make Rank 8s.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As an archetype that consists primarily of LIGHT and Dragon monsters, specific Attribute and typing counters, such as "[[Ally of Justice]]", "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]" or "[[Bystial]]" monsters can significantly hamper the deck's performance.
  * As most of the key cards of this archetype are either high-level monsters or a low-level searchers with low stats, the player is likely to have dead draws or a bricked hand that reduce the deck's consistency, if not unable to make any plays. (As of recent support in the OCG, this issue has mostly been mitigated, with Blue-Eyes variants now able to perform "1-card" and "2-card" combos with help of the new [[Primite]] engine)
