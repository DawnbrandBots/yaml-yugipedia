  "'''Blue-Eyes'''" (ブルーアイズ ''Burūaizu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Dragon]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Seto Kaiba]], [[Kaibaman (character)|Kaibaman]], [[Paradox]], and [[Roku]]. A mysterious woman named [[Kisara]] carries the spirit of the "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]" as revealed in both the anime and manga.

  Though members have existed since the ''[[Starter Box: Theatrical Release]]'' in 1999, it only received its first explicit [[support]] in 2015 with the release of "[[Priestess with Eyes of Blue]]".

  == Design ==
  Most "Blue-Eyes" monsters closely resemble the original "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]", as all monsters in this archetype are either [[retrained]] [[counterpart]]s, downgraded, or [[Card evolutions|upgraded]] forms of "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". The With Eyes of Blue monsters are based on the four people who carried the spirit of "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]" in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime, included [[Kisara]].

  === Ultimate Dragon ===
  "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" has multiple Fusion counterparts, most well knowns are Level 12 Ultimate Dragon Fusions. Visually, they are three-headed evolved counterparts of their base forms. Most of these monsters are Fusion Summoned using three "Blue-Eyes White Dragons", similar to the original "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]". 

  The only Ultimate Dragon that  cannot be Fusion Summoned is "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Spirit Dragon]]", which is a [[Synchro monster]], but it can be Special Summoned by using the effect of its Base Counterpart, "[[Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon]]".

  === Dragon Master ===

  In the [[Yu-Gi-Oh!_(anime)|original anime]], "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]" was used as a Fusion material along with "[[Black Luster Soldier]]" for a monster named "[[Dragon Master Knight]]". In the OCG/TCG, a retrained counterpart of this monster is released named "[[Dragon Master Magia]]", which uses "[[Magician of Black Chaos]]" as its visual Fusion material.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Blue-Eyes" archetype centers on the Level 8 LIGHT Dragon Normal Monster, "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]"; most "Blue-Eyes" Extra Deck monsters specify "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" as a material, and many "Blue-Eyes" support cards support "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" specifically. Generally, a "Blue-Eyes" Deck aims to utilize the support for "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" to [[swarm]] the field with many copies of it and its variants, and use them make Main Deck or Extra Deck boss monsters for [[OTK]]s or field control.

  The archetype's boss monsters can be broadly divided into four types by their card typing: Main Deck non-Ritual, Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, Link and Xyz.
  * Main Deck non-Ritual: They generally have field control or supportive effects, and typically support the archetype's swarming of Level 8 monsters and/or provide individual pieces of removal. Examples include "[[Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon]]", "[[Dragon Spirit of White]]", "[[Deep-Eyes White Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Abyss Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Solid Dragon]]" and "[[Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon]]".
  * Ritual: Consisting of "[[Blue-Eyes Chaos MAX Dragon]]" and "[[Blue-Eyes Chaos Dragon]]", they are Level 8 Ritual Monsters that synergize with the Ritual Spell "[[Chaos Form]]". They focus on performing [[OTK]]s by dealing massive [[piercing]] damage, while having a protective effect that prevents them from being targeted or destroyed by the opponent's card effects.
  * Fusion: Consisting of "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Twin Burst Dragon]]", "[[Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Alternative Ultimate Dragon]]" and "[[Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon]]", they require 2 or 3 "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" as materials. They focus on performing [[OTK]]s by having large ATK and being able to attack multiple times, and/or focus on controlling the field by having strong protections and the ability to remove opposing cards.
  * Synchro: Consisting of "[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Spirit Dragon]]", "[[Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon]]" and "[[Azure-Eyes Silver Dragon]]", they are 9 and 12 Synchro Monsters that focus on controlling the field by providing situational floodgating, effect negation, monster protection, and monster revival. "Spirit Dragon" notably can Tribute itself to Special Summon any LIGHT Dragon Synchro Monster from the Extra Deck as a [[Quick Effect]], giving it significant flexibility.
  * Link: Only Consisting of "[[Spirit with Eyes of Blue]]".
  * Xyz: Only Consisting of "[[Indigo-Eyes Silver Dragon]]".


  The archetype's main lower-level support monsters are all Level 1 LIGHT Tuner monsters, and can be divided into two types: the [[with Eyes of Blue]] Spellcasters, and the "White Stone" Dragons ("[[The White Stone of Ancients]]" and "[[The White Stone of Legend]]"). The "with Eyes of Blue" monsters focus on searching and interacting with Level 1 LIGHT Tuners and Special Summoning "Blue-Eyes" monsters, making them consistency boosters for both the archetype's low-level monsters and boss monsters. The "White Stone" monsters meanwhile can search out "Blue-Eyes" monsters if sent to the GY, and are commonly sent to GY by milling or discarding costs/effects from other cards. Their status as Level 1 Tuners lets them easily make archetypal and non-archetypal Level 9 Synchro boss monsters if summoned alongside a Level 8 "Blue-Eyes" monster.

  The card attributes that surround "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" (Level 8, LIGHT, Dragon, Normal Monster) gives it a large amount of external support. Examples include "[[Trade-In]]", "[[The Melody of Awakening Dragon]]", "[[Dragon Shrine]]", "[[Dragon Ravine]]", "[[Silver's Cry]]", and "[[Return of the Dragon Lords]]". Though the archetype has no archetypal [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] boss monsters, the archetype's ability to swarm Level 8 monsters enables easy Xyz Summons of powerful Rank 8 monsters, such as "[[Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As an archetype that consists primarily of LIGHT and Dragon monsters, specific Attribute and typing counters, such as "[[Ally of Justice]]", "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]" or "[[Bystial]]" monsters can significantly hamper the deck's performance.
  * As most of the key cards of this archtype are either high-level monsters or a low-level searchers with low stats, the player is likely to have dead draws or bricked hand that reduce the deck's consistency, if not unable to make any plays.
