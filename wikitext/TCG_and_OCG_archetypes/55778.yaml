  "'''Machina'''", known as "'''Machiners'''" (マシンナーズ ''Mashinnāzu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'' and some video games, and as "'''Machine'''" in the English manga, is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] and [[DARK]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] which debuted in the ''OCG'' in ''[[Premium Pack 9]]''. "Machina" monsters were used by [[Kirk Dixon]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! R]]'' manga, [[Blister]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, and [[Bolt Tanner (manga)|Bolt Tanner]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' manga.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  Jerome McHale explained in a [http://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=15840093&postcount=67 post on Pojo] that the archetype's name was localized in the ''[[TCG]]'' name to "Machina" from "Machiners" because the former name "clearly demonstrates that these are Machine monsters, not other [[Type]]s of monsters that do work on machines".

  == Members ==
  The "Machina" monsters can be divided into four groups of monsters based on their order of release. Each group of monsters share similar traits and effects, and some later members are [[counterpart]]s of earlier ones.

  == Playstyle ==
  === Overview ===
  The "Machina" archetype's overall game plan is a relentless [[beatdown]] strategy, constantly dumping and reviving easily Special Summoned high-ATK boss monsters to end the game as quickly as possible. The two main boss monsters are "[[Machina Fortress]]" and "[[Machina Citadel]]". "Fortress" can easily be Special Summoned from hand/GY by discarding Machines from the hand (including itself) and had high ATK for its time. "Citadel" can be summoned from the GY when any EARTH Machine is destroyed, and has a Quick Effect to destroy a Machine you control and all opposing monsters with equal/less ATK. However, many cards rely on discarding or banishing from the GY, limiting its grind game.

  Machina is often combined with other [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] archetypes, most notably the "[[Infinitrack]]" archetype and the "[[Train]]" series. These improve the deck's grind game while bolstering the Deck's potential endboards. In the past, Machina was often run with "[[Gadget]]".

  The original "Machina" playstyle was focused on [[Special Summon]]ing "[[Machina Force]]" with the effect of "[[Commander Covington]]"; this playstyle had become obsolete with later "Machina" support and boss monsters, which are far more effective and poorly synergize with this original playstyle. Some "Machina" monsters are also [[Union monster]]s, but these effects only play a minimal role in the current "Machina" playstyle.

  === Cards ===
  The archetype can be split into three general types of monsters:
  * High Level Machina that discard or destroy Machines/Machinas for a Special Summon. ("[[Machina Air Raider]]", "[[Machina Irradiator]]", "[[Machina Cannon]]" and "[[Machina Fortress]]")
  * High Level Machina that want to be discarded for their GY effects and have effects that trigger on destruction. ("[[Machina Ruinforce]]", "[[Machina Megaform]]" and "[[Machina Citadel]]"). These tend to have good on-field effects, being the main payoffs of the deck.
  * Lower Level Machina that help protect, mill, search and swarm the higher Level Machina.

  The key "Machina" consistency cards are "[[Machina Gearframe]]", "[[Machina Metalcruncher]]", and "[[Machina Redeployment]]", which all help search the Deck.

  "[[Machina Air Raider]]" and "[[Machina Irradiator]]" are supportive monsters that also require discarding to be Special Summoned, and can destroy the player's monsters to Special Summon "Machina" monsters from the [[Deck]] or GY. Their Spells and Traps vary from searching, protection and recycling. "[[Machina Redeployment]]" helps dump higher level Machina into the GY to search more Machina. "[[Machina Overdrive]]" help bring out a Machina right from the deck and serves as recycle, "[[Machina Armored Unit]]" and "[[Machina Defense Perimeter]]" both serves as protection and recycling.

  Due to the effects of "Machina Citadel" and "Machina Ruinforce" triggering from destruction, "Machina" can opt to run cards that benefit from this, such as "[[Torrential Tribute]]", [[Meklord Emperor Wisel]]" and "[[Dark Hole Dragon]]". Additionally, thanks to their ability to swarm the field with EARTH Machine monsters, "Machina" can opt to run a small "Ancient Gear" package to take advantage of "[[Ancient Gear Ballista]]". In formats where "[[Predaplant Verte Anaconda]]" is legal this package can even facilitate the summoning of "[[Chaos Ancient Gear Giant]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The archetype relies on its [[GY]] to maximize its limited grind game; if all monsters [[sent]] to the GY are [[banish]]ed instead, such as by the effect of "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" or "[[Macro Cosmos]]", the archetype becomes completely incapable of grinding and will easily burn itself out with its discard and self-destruction effects. In addition some Machina monster also need their card to be sent to the [[GY]] to activate their effects which means these card are extra effective against the archetype.
  * Due to the deck heavy reliance on Type and Attribute to proc most of their effect, cards such as "[[Zombie World]]" or "[[Lair of Darkness]]" will shut down half of the archetype.
  * As a [[Machine]] archetype, specific [[Type]]-counter cards such as "[[System Down]]" or "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" are very effective against the [[Deck]] as [[Side Deck]] options.
