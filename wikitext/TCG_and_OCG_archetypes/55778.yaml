  "'''Machina'''", known as "'''Machiners'''" (マシンナーズ ''Mashinnāzu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'' and some video games, and as "'''Machine'''" in the English manga, is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] and [[DARK]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] which debuted in the ''OCG'' in ''[[Premium Pack 9]]''. "Machina" monsters were used by [[Kirk Dixon]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! R]]'' manga, [[Blister]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, and [[Bolt Tanner (manga)|Bolt Tanner]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' manga.
  Jerome McHale explained in a [http://www.pojo.biz/board/showpost.php?p=15840093&postcount=67 post on Pojo] that the archetype's name was localized in the ''[[TCG]]'' name to "Machina" from "Machiners" because the former name "clearly demonstrates that these are Machine monsters, not other [[Type]]s of monsters that do work on machines".

  == Members ==
  The "Machina" monsters can be divided into four groups of monsters based on their order of release. Each group of monsters share similar traits and effects, and some later members are [[counterpart]]s of earlier ones.

  == Playstyle ==
  The archetype can be split into two type of monsters :
  * Higher Level Machina that either have an effect to discard another Machina/Machine to the GY such as "[[Machina Air Raider]]", "[[Machina Irradiator]]", "[[Machina Cannon]]" and "[[Machina Fortress]]" or want to be discarded to the graveyard due to their graveyard effect such as "[[Machina Ruinforce]]", "[[Machina Megaform]]" and "[[Machina Citadel]]". These Machina effect varies between removal and negate effect of "[[Machina Fortress]]", "[[Machina Citadel]]" and "[[Machina Ruinforce]]" to replacing current Machina such as "[[Machina Air Raider]]" and "[[Machina Irradiator]]" and "[[Machina Megaform]]".
  * Lower level Machina that help protect, mil, search and swarm the higher level Machina.
  The only exception to this rule is "[[Machina Metalcruncher]]" which is a hybrid between these two types being able to be normal summon to search out other Machina and being good discard so it could be bring back with higher ATK with it's effect.

  The original "Machina" playstyle was focused on [[Special Summon]]ing "[[Machina Force]]" with the effect of "[[Commander Covington]]"; this playstyle had become obsolete with later "Machina" support and boss monsters, which are far more effective and poorly synergize with this original playstyle. Some "Machina" monsters are also [[Union monster]]s, but these effects only play a minimal role in the current "Machina" playstyle.

  Generally, [[EARTH]] "Machina" monsters are high-[[Level]] monsters with two common effect patterns: Special Summoning themselves by [[discard]]ing [[Machine]] monsters, and [[destroy]]ing the player's Machine monsters (or [[trigger]] their effects in response to their destruction) for advantage. The two main "Machina" boss monsters with [[field]]-holding powers are "[[Machina Fortress]]" and "[[Machina Citadel]]", whose effects reflect these two patterns: "Fortress" can be Special Summoned from the [[hand]] or [[GY]] by discarding Machine monster(s) whose total Levels equal 8 or more, while "Citadel" can be Special Summoned from the GY if an EARTH Machine monster is destroyed, and has a [[Quick Effect]] that destroys the opponent's monsters by destroying one of the player's Machine monster.

  The two key "Machina" consistency monsters are "[[Machina Metalcruncher]]" and "[[Machina Gearframe]]", who can [[search]] out "Machina" monsters when Summoned. "[[Machina Air Raider]]" and "[[Machina Irradiator]]" are supportive monsters that also require discarding to be Special Summoned, and can destroy the player's monsters to Special Summon "Machina" monsters from the [[Deck]] or GY.

  The [[DARK]] "Machina" monsters have more diverse supportive effects. "[[Machina Possesstorage]]" revives "Machina" monsters in the GY, "[[Machina Unclaspare]]" is an extender that also [[mill]]s a "Machina" monster, and "[[Machina Resavenger]]" is an [[ATK]] boost [[hand trap]] with self-recovery. The DARK "Machina" boss monster, "[[Machina Ruinforce]]", is a 4600 ATK [[beatstick]] that can Special Summon itself from the GY by [[banish]]ing Machine monsters in the GY; it can [[negate]] [[card effect]]s during the [[Battle Phase]], and can Special Summon banished "Machina" monsters when destroyed.

  Their spell and trap varies from searching, protection and recycling. "[[Machina Redeployment]]" help dump higher level Machina into the GY to search more Machina. "[[Machina Overdrive]]" help bring out a Machina right from the deck and serves as recycle, "[[Machina Armored Unit]]" and "[[Machina Defense Perimeter]]" both serves as protection and recycling.

  Due to the effects of "Machina Citadel" and "Machina Ruinforce" triggering from destruction, "Machina" can opt to run cards that benefit from this, such as "[[Torrential Tribute]]", [[Meklord Emperor Wisel]]" and "[[Dark Hole Dragon]]".

  The "Machina" archetype's overall game plan is a relentless beatdown strategy, constantly dumping and reviving easily Special Summoned high-ATK boss monsters to end the game as quickly as possible. While the Deck has little to no protection, it is capable of dodging targeted effect with their self-popping effect and either replace themselves or reviving another "Machina" monster from the Deck or graveyard, or blow up the opponent's field with the effect of "Machina Citadel". However, the archetype's reliance on discards and destroying the player's monsters gives it a poor grind game. This archetypal weakness is typically mitigated by hybridizing the Deck with another Machine archetype that provides a much stronger grind game, the most common ones being the "[[Infinitrack]]" archetype and [[Train]] series, with "[[Gadget]]" also have been run with them in the past.

  Additionally, thanks to their ability to swarm the field with EARTH Machine monsters, "Machina" can opt to run a small "Ancient Gear" package to take advantage of "[[Ancient Gear Ballista]]". In formats where "[[Predaplant Verte Anaconda]]" is legal this package can even facilitate the summoning of "[[Chaos Ancient Gear Giant]]".

  === Machina Gadget ===

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The archetype relies on its [[GY]] to maximize its limited grind game; if all monsters [[sent]] to the GY are [[banish]]ed instead, such as by the effect of "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" or "[[Macro Cosmos]]", the archetype becomes completely incapable of grinding and will easily burn itself out with its discard and self-destruction effects. In addition some Machina monster also need their card to be sent to the [[GY]] to activate their effects which means these card are extra effective against the archetype.
  * Due to the deck huge reliance on Type and Attribute to proc most of their effect, cards such as "[[Zombie World]]" or "[[Lair of Darkness]]" will shut down half of the archetype.
  * As a [[Machine]] archetype, specific [[Type]]-counter cards such as "[[System Down]]" or "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" are very effective against the [[Deck]] as [[Side Deck]] options.
