  "'''Lyrilusc'''", known as "'''Lyrical Luscinia'''" ({{Ruby|ＬＬ|リリカル・ルスキニア}} ''Ririkaru Rusukinia'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 1 [[WIND]] [[Winged Beast]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Lulu Obsidian]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  [[File:Lyrical Luscinia.png|thumb|left|[[Lulu Obsidian|Lulu]] with three "[[Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow (anime)|Lyrilusc - Cobalt Sparrow]]s" and two "[[Lyrilusc - Sapphire Swallow (anime)|Lyrilusc - Sapphire Swallow]]s".]]
  Similar to the "[[Harpie]]" monsters, the "Lyrilusc" monsters consist of female monsters with bird features. They appear to wear a full-body costume based on the birds of their namesake, making them more similar in appearance to the [[Blackwing]] monsters. The [[Main Deck]] monsters have a child-like appearance, while the [[Extra Deck]] monsters have an adult-like appearance.

  === Etymology ===
  The archetype's name is a reference to ''[[wikipedia:Luscinia|Luscinia]]'', a genus of [[wikipedia:passerine|passerine]] birds that includes most nightingales. The initialism of the name being "LL" is likely meant to mirror "[[Raidraptor]]" ("RR"), as both archetypes are used by the Obsidian siblings. The ''TCG'' name is a shortened version of the ''OCG'' one.

  Every member is named after a passerine; the Main Deck monsters also use a blue mineral/gemstone (which may a reference to the fact that Lulu's Japanese name, Ruri, means "[[wikipedia:lapis lazuli|lapis lazuli]]"), while the Xyz Monsters seem to use words that refer to gatherings of people.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Lyrilusc" archetype consists of [[Level]] 1 monsters focused on [[Rank]] 1 [[Xyz Summon]] tactics. They possess [[swarm]]ing and [[search]]ing effects to aid in quickly gathering many monsters to Summon their [[Xyz Monster]]s, who become stronger the more [[Xyz Material]]s they possess. "Assembled Nightingale" gains ATK for each of its material, can attack as many times as its materials while it has any, and has an innate [[Direct attack]] effect. "Recital Starling" can help boost the ATK of another monster on the field while also tutoring even more "Lyrilusc" from the Deck. "Promenade Thrush" can help sweep away Spells/Traps that might potentially hinder plays and boost another attacking monster's ATK. "Ensemblue Robin" can help removing monsters from the opponent's field and recover another "Lyrilusc" when it is sent to the GY. With a good field setup and enough materials, "Assembled Nightingale" can quickly [[One Turn Kill|OTK]] the opponent without much problem. Otherwise, "Assembled Nightingale" can also be used as [[Fusion Material]] for "Independent Nightingale", whose ATK and burn effect can become massive depending on the number of Xyz Materials attached to the fused monsters.

  === Weakness ===
  Despite their ability to quickly bring out their main powerhouse to dish high amount of battle damage, and massive protection against battle, targeting, and effect-based destruction, cards that can negate their effect or flip them face down such as [[Skill Drain]] or [[Swords of Concealing Light]] will shut them down. Additionally, since they rely on gaining ATK through card effects while having 0 natural ATK and DEF, cards that force monsters to utilize their original ATK or abuse [[Piercing]] battle damage while forcing the opponent into Defense Position can greatly endanger the archetype.
