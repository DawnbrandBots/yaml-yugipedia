  "'''Yubel'''" (ユベル ''Yuberu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] monsters with 0 [[ATK]]/[[DEF]] based on the various forms of [[Yubel|the namesake card]], used by the [[Duel Monster Spirit]] [[Yubel (character)|Yubel]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. While the "Yubel" archetype was minimally supported in the anime by "[[Neos Wiseman (anime)|Neos Wiseman]]", it was not officially supported as an archetype in the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'' until ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]''. 

  The ''OCG''/''TCG'' support for the "Yubel" archetype consists of [[retrained]] counterparts of cards that were used by Yubel in the anime, specifically during their [[Duel]] against [[Adrian Gecko]] (while possessing [[Jesse Anderson]]) and later [[Jaden Yuki]] (as their spirit form).

  ==Playing style==
  "Yubel" monsters share the common effect that they cannot be [[destroy]]ed by [[battle]] and the controller does not take any [[battle damage]] from battles involving them. In addition, the original three members ("[[Yubel]]", "[[Yubel - Terror Incarnate]]", and "[[Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare]]"), as well as "[[Yubel - The Loving Defender Forever]]", each have effects that damage the opponent based on the monster it battles.

  The archetype's original strategy was to have the original "Yubel" monsters be destroyed, allowing the Special Summon of more powerful forms of "Yubel". Destroying the original "Yubel" allows the Special Summon of "Terror Incarnate", which can destroy other monsters on the field during each turn. Making "Terror Incarnate" leave the field enables "The Ultimate Nightmare" to be Summoned, which can destroy monsters by battle. However, this strategy was not a threat due to the limited number of viable choices that could destroy and Summon the original three "Yubel" monsters. In addition, "Ultimate Nightmare" lacked a protection or floating effect, meaning that if it was removed, you would have to start over with the regular "YubeL".

  In ''[[Phantom Nightmare]]'', this archetype received its first wave of support. After the support from "[[Legacy of Destruction]]" and "[[Battles of Legend: Terminal Revenge]]", the "Yubel" archetype is most often seen as part of "[[Fiend]] [[Link Monster|Link]]" Decks (alongside "[[Unchained]]" and later "[[Fiendsmith]]"), where the "Yubel" cards are used to generate Link Material and interactions.

  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Card
  ! Description
  |-
  | [[Geistgrinder Golem]]
  | Special Summons a "Yubel" monster from hand, then Special Summons itself to your opponent's field, acting as a high ATK target for "Yubel" monsters to attack. If it battles an opponent's monster, the opponent (usually the card's owner) gains 3000 LP. Not used often due to the downside of giving your opponent a monster.
  |-
  | [[Samsara D Lotus]]
  | Can Tribute itself to Special Summon a "Yubel" monster from the Deck, acting as a combo starter. Also, if on field, it can overwrite a monster effect, turning the effect into "Destroy 1 "Yubel" monster on the field."
  |-
  | [[Spirit of Yubel]]
  | Searches a Spell/Trap card that mentions "Yubel", and summons the original "Yubel" when destroyed. Can also Special Summon itself when an opponent declares an attack, which, when combined with the "Yubel" archetype's battle immunity, acts as a wall.
  |-
  | [[Yubel - The Loving Defender Forever]]
  | Can be Fusion Summoned with a "Yubel" monster and any number of Effect Monsters, allowing the opponent's board to be fused away with "[[Super Polymerization]]" or "[[Eternal Favorite]]". Inflicts 500 damage for each fusion material used for its summon, banishes any monster it battles, and has destruction immunity.
  |-
  | [[Gruesome Grave Squirmer]]
  | Can Special Summon itself and (optionally) destroy a monster you control, acting as an extender (by triggering floating effects) and a way to dodge targeted effects.
  |-
  | [[Phantom of Yubel]]
  | Can be Contact Fused with a "Yubel" monster and a 0 ATK/DEF monster (using materials from the hand, field and/or GY). In addition to acting as Link Material, it can overwrite your opponent's monster effects into "Your opponent destroys 1 "Yubel" monster in their hand, Deck, or field".
  |-
  | [[Nightmare Pain]]
  | Can destroy a DARK monster to add a support card for "Yubel", while forcing your opponent to attack "Yubel" monsters and reflects any battle damage you would've taken (which is independent from the "Yubel" monsters' effects).
  |-
  | [[Nightmare Throne]]
  | Can search or destroy a [[Fiend]] monster with 0 ATK/DEF in the Deck. If a "Yubel" monster leaves the field by card effect, can tutor a "Yubel" monster with +/- 1 Level.
  |- 
  | [[Mature Chronicle]]
  | Gains [[Chronicle Counter]]s when a "Yubel" monster is Special Summoned. Can use counters to activate one of five effects, including: revive "Yubel", recur a banished card, banish a card from the Deck, destroy a card on the field, or search "[[Super Polymerization]]".
  |-
  | [[Eternal Favorite]]
  | Either Summons "Yubel" monster from GY/banishment or allows a fusion with your "Yubel" monster and monsters from either field.
  |}

  The most notable outsider cards that support the archetype's playstyle are [[Sacred Beast]]-related cards, namely "[[Dark Beckoning Beast]]" and "[[Opening of the Spirit Gates]]". The former acts as an extender: it allows an additional Normal Summon of a Fiend with 0 ATK/DEF, searches "Opening of the Spirit Gates", and acts as [[Link]] material or a valid Fusion Material for "Phantom of Yubel". The latter is able to revive "Yubel" or "Spirit of Yubel" and recover a Continuous Spell from the GY to the hand (such as "Nightmare Pain" and "Mature Chronicle") while the player controls a Level 10 monster.

  The "[[Unchained]]" archetype is often combined with "[[Yubel]]", as "Unchained" is a [[Fiend]]-centric archetype that can destroy Yubel monsters on the field, while the "Yubel" monsters can access the "Unchained" engine with "[[Unchained Soul Lord of Yama]]".

  === Official Decks ===
  A Deck that combines "Yubel" and "Madolche", and makes use of "[[Madolche Fresh Sistart]]" from "LINK VRAINS PACK".

  "Yubel – Terror Incarnate" destroys all monsters on the field except itself, while "Madolche Fresh Sistart", on the field, can return a "Madolche" monster from your GY to the Deck to remain on the field.

  In tandem, you can activate "[[Madolche Ticket]]" to Special Summon "Madolche" to the field, so you can Sweep your opponent’s field each turn, while preserving your own field, making it a strong combination.<ref>https://ygorganization.com/thekeyingredientinthesesweetsarenightmares/</ref>

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Common Spell/Trap Card removal options (e.g. "[[Harpie's Feather Duster]]", "[[Lightning Storm]]", "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]") are highly effective against "Yubel" decks as they are highly dependent on their supporting face-up Continuous Spells/Traps, "[[Nightmare Throne]]" and/or a Set "[[Super Polymerization]]". In particular, any means of removing the Continuous Spells/Traps and "Nightmare Throne" in response to the activation of their face-up effects (such as with "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]") will cause them to resolve without effect, slowing down "Yubel" strategies significantly as these cards' effects have a [[once per turn]] restriction on their usage. 

  * Opposing cards that would remove "Yubel" monsters from the field other than destroying them such as the effects of "[[S:P Little Knight]]", "[[Knightmare Unicorn]]" and "[[Kashtira Fenrir]]" or monsters which can remove "Yubel" monsters as part of their Summon procedure (e.g. "[[Kaiju]]" monsters, "[[The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode]]" and "[[Underworld Goddess of the Closed World]]") can also pose a serious treat. However, most of these effects will still trigger the effect of "Yubel - Terror Incarnate" to Special Summon "Yubel - The Ultimate Nightmare", as well as "Nightmare Throne" to recurse and possibly even Summon the removed monster again later). 

  * As all "Yubel" Main Deck monsters are Level 10+ monsters and they do not have any useful effects while in the hand (aside from "Spirit of Yubel"), they become troublesome [[brick]]s if the user does not open with another card to make immediate use of them. As such, "Yubel" decks suffer from consistency problems if their most important card effects get interrupted by common opposing [[hand trap]]s. This issue can be alleviated by using these monsters as material to Summon "[[Phantom of Yubel]]".

  * The high-level of "Yubel" monsters also means that cards that prevent Special Summons are also troublesome to deal with since only the original "Yubel" and "Spirit of Yubel" can be Normal Summoned (each requiring 2 Tributes).

  * Floodgates:
  ** Floodgates that banish monsters from the GY, such as "[[Dimension Shifter]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]", limit access to "Phantom of Yubel", and hurt other aspects of Fiend Link, severely limiting the Deck. Note, however, that "[[Necrovalley]]" cannot prevent the Summon of "Phantom of Yubel".
  ** Cards that negate the effects of monsters on the field (such as "[[Skill Drain]]" and "[[Destiny HERO - Plasma]]") are detrimental, though they also enable "Yubel" monsters to tag out into their other forms by crashing, quickly dealing damage with "[[Nightmare Pain]]".

  * Due to its reliance on monsters with 0 ATK/DEF, this archetype relies on your opponent having monsters in order to deal damage, meaning that it has difficulty dealing with an empty field. However, this can be alleviated by using other monsters to whittle the opponent down.
