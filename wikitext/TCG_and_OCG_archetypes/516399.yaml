  "'''Superheavy Samurai'''" ({{Ruby|超|ちょう}}{{ruby|重|じゅう}}{{ruby|武|む}}{{ruby|者|しゃ}} ''Chōjūmusha'') is an [[archetype]] comprised mainly of [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Gong Strong]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. They are collectively based on [[wikipedia:Benkei|Benkei]] and miscellaneous details of his life. 

  ==Etymology==
  So far, the Japanese names of the "Superheavy Samurai" monsters in the archetype tend to follow a similar pattern of those of the "[[Karakuri]]", in that they have a "numbered code" after the main name and then a second name in quotation marks; for example, "[[Karakuri Muso mdl 818 "Haipa"]]". These codes are often followed by puns; for example, "[[Superheavy Samurai Swordsman]]" (Japanese name ''Superheavy Samurai Sword-999''), with "kyu" being the Japanese word for "nine" (''kyukyoku'' roughly translates to "ultimate") and "[[Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler]]" (Superheavy Samurai Waka-O2), "ni" being Japanese for "two" and thus allowing one to read it as "oni" ("oni" roughly translating to "devil"). This has been removed from the ''[[TCG]]'' names, as the puns are largely untranslatable.

  ==Playing style==
  "Superheavy Samurai" is a monster-heavy archetype that is originally themed around Synchro Summoning. While the archetype does not have restrictions on Special Summoning, many cards require the player to have no Spells/Traps in their GY to use their effects, encouraging an all-monster Deck.

  On first release, it focused on Synchro Summoning their ace monsters, which had high DEF and could attack in Defense position, dodging specific cards like  "[[Mirror Force]]" and "[[Number 101: Silent Honor ARK]]" The bosses had a variety of effects, [[Superheavy Samurai Swordmaster Musashi|retrieval]] of a Machine monster to the [[Superheavy Samurai Warlord Susanowo|theft]] of Spell/Trap Cards from the opponent's Graveyard.

  With the introduction of "[[Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi]]" and "[[Superheavy Samurai Monk Big Benkei]]" in ''[[Cyberstorm Access]]'', the Deck's playstyle has been drastically shifted into an aggressive combo Deck, summoning a large number of [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] and/or [[Link Monster]]s, recycling "[[Superheavy Samurai Soulpiercer]]" to perform multiple searches a turn. Without any locks, it could create an oppressive [[negate]] board with generic monsters like "[[Baronne de Fleur]]" and "[[Borreload Savage Dragon]]", as well as the Machine-themed "[[Therion "King" Regulus]]". It could also [[FTK]] in multiple ways. This resulted in "Soulpiercer" and "[[Superheavy Samurai Scarecrow]]" (which is often used to enable "Soulpiercer's" search effects) to be [[Limited]] and [[Forbidden]] in the ''[[OCG]]'' and ''[[TCG]]'', respectively to curb the Deck's power.

  There are three basic subsets of monsters:
  * Monsters with battle-related effects that can change their position on Summon. Examples include "[[Superheavy Samurai Blue Brawler|Blue Brawler]]", "[[Superheavy Samurai Swordsman|Swordsman]]", "[[Superheavy Samurai Magnet|Magnet]]" and "Big Benkei". These do not see much competitive play today.
  * The "[[Superheavy Samurai Soul]]" sub-archetype, which can be equipped to a monster for beneficial effects. They are supported directly by "[[Superheavy Samurai Wagon]]".
  * [[Advantage]]-generating monsters that require the GY to have no Spells/Traps for their effects to activate.

  Because there are no archetypal locks, it can be used as a generic engine. Even Decks that use Spells/Traps can run a small SHS engine - consisting of "[[Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi|Wakaushi]]", "[[Superheavy Samurai Motorbike|Motorbike]]", "[[Superheavy Samurai Monk Big Benkei|Monk Big Benkei]]", and a "Superheavy Samurai Soul" monster - to Summon various Levels of Synchro monsters or a Rank 4 monster without the Normal Summon.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Due to the Deck often relies of repeatedly recycling "[[Superheavy Samurai Soulpiercer]]" to perform their combos, "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" can effectively shut down their combo.
  * As a Machine-Type Deck, this Deck can be vulnerable to cards such as "[[Acid Rain]]", "[[Electric Virus]]", "[[System Down]]", and "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" (being used as Fusion Materials for that monster's Special Summon).
  ** As a Deck that heavily relies on a single Monster Type, it is also vulnerable to "[[There Can Be Only One]]".
  * As a Deck that relies on using low-ATK monsters, this Deck can be vulnerable to cards such as "[[Deck Devastation Virus]]" and "[[King Tiger Wanghu]]".
  ** "[[Power Filter]]" can also be effective against this Deck's Main Deck monsters, with the notable exception of "[[Superheavy Samurai Wagon]]", as well as a few other minor exceptions. However it is important to note that their monsters can still be Normal Summoned, and that the Deck can still Special Summon monsters from the Extra Deck with more than 1000 ATK, if given the opportunity (although they can rarely Special Summon non-"Superheavy Samurai" monsters, due to their own prevalent Special Summon restrictions).
  * As a Deck that rarely uses Spell/Trap Cards, this Deck can be rendered helpless against cards like "[[First of the Dragons]]" and "[[Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician]]". While "First of the Dragons" can be addressed somewhat with the use of "[[Kaiju]]" monsters and/or "[[Breakthrough Skill]]", the latter monster's effect is not so easily addressed.
  * "[[Inferno Tempest]]" is particularly lethal against this archetype if successfully pulled off as it can potentially banish the entire deck due to mostly being made of only monsters.
