  == Playing style ==
  The archetype is focused around [[swarm]] and [[banish]] tactics, primarily through cards such as "[[Heraldic Beast Eale]]" and "[[Heraldic Beast Unicorn]]". They also have a number of cards to maintain a [[hand]] advantage such as "[[Heraldic Beast Leo]]" and "[[Heraldic Beast Aberconway]]". They also feature [[support]] for [[Psychic]] [[Xyz Monster]]s.
  The Deck relies on putting "Heraldic Beast" monsters in the Graveyard, either to activate their effect (in the case of "[[Heraldic Beast Leo]]") or to use their effects later (in the cases of "[[Heraldic Beast Unicorn]]" and "[[Heraldic Beast Twin-Headed Eagle]]"). Due to the entire archetype being made up of Level 4 monsters, they heavily rely on [[Xyz Summon]]ing [[Rank 4 Monster Cards]], and this is supported through "[[Advanced Heraldry Art]]" and "[[Heraldry Reborn]]".
  Of particular note is the importance of "Heraldic Beast Leo". Due to its ability to search other "Heraldic Beast" monsters out, it is key to Summon it quickly with cards like "[[Summoner Monk]]" and "[[Goblindbergh]]" or swarming the field with cards like "[[Photon Thrasher]]" and "[[Kagetokage]]".
  Although this Deck relies heavily on the Graveyard, using "[[Lightsworn]]" cards is usually not recommended, due to the fact that its indiscriminate [[mill]]ing can backfire if "[[Advanced Heraldry Art]]" and "[[Heraldry Reborn]]" are milled.
  "[[Number 18: Heraldry Patriarch]]" works as the Deck's floater, letting you send your "Heraldic Beast" monsters directly from your Deck to your Graveyard as soon as it is sent to the Graveyard. After its [[Xyz Summon]]ed for the first time, "[[Heraldic Beast Unicorn]]" can [[Special Summon]] it back from your Graveyard, letting you re-use its effect and even be used for field presence. It also lets the Deck use "[[Mind Over Matter]]", which can hinder your opponent's moves while loading your Graveyard with more "Heraldic Beast" monsters. Additionally, since it doesn't specify the place it needs to be before being sent to the Graveyard, you can use its effect even when its Summon is negated (although this will block it from being Summoned by "Unicorn") and even when [[detach]]ed as an [[Xyz Material]], as when its used with a "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" card.

  === Weaknesses ===
  Since this Deck relies on accumulating materials in your Graveyard, "[[The End of Anubis]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]" and "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" can force this Deck to a screeching halt. "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" and "[[Prohibition]]" can also be dangerous, since both of them can stop the effects of "[[Heraldic Beast Leo]]".
  Individually, all the "Heraldic Beasts" except "[[Heraldic Beast Leo|Leo]]" and "[[Heraldic Beast Aberconway|Aberconway]]" have below-average ATK, and they cannot survive for long if they cannot be used for an Xyz Summon at all. Anti-Special Summon cards (such as "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" and "[[Vanity's Fiend]]") and anti-Spell Cards (such as "[[Naturia Beast]]", and "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8]]") can deadlock this Deck effectively.
  Mirror matches between "Heraldic Beasts" can also be quite hazardous, since this Deck's reliance on Xyz Summoning can conflict with this Deck's own ace monster, "[[Number 8: Heraldic King Genom-Heritage]]" (which can be disastrous for any Xyz Monsters). Also, due to this Deck's focus on anti-Xyz tactics, it may have trouble against Synchro Summon-oriented Decks, because cards such as "Genom-Heritage" and "Heraldry Crest" are fairly useless against them, with their relatively low ATK and exclusively anti-Xyz effects.
