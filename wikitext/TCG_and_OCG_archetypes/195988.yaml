  == Playing style ==
  The "Heraldic Beast" archetype focuses on repeatedly Summoning Rank 4 Xyz Monsters with the aid of the "[[Heraldry]]" Spell/Trap Cards. The Graveyard is loaded by means of "[[Number 18: Heraldry Patriarch]]" and "[[Heraldic Beast Gryphon]]" to trigger "[[Heraldic Beast Leo]]" and then get revived with cards such as "[[Heraldic Beast Stad Whale]]" or "[[Advanced Heraldry Art]]": the second effect of "Gryphon" will let you make "[[Number 69: Heraldry Crest - Shatter Stream]]" (by way of "[[Number 69: Heraldry Crest]]") very easily. While this line is permitted under the archetype's harshest lock of "[[Augmented Heraldry]]", said card also heavily restricts making just about anything else the entire turn, and as "Shatter Stream" is once per turn, to have more than one interruption you must make both it and hard make a "[[Number 69: Heraldry Crest - Dark Matter Demolition]]", without the aid of cards like "[[Ext Ryzeal]]" entirely.

  The newest cards, "Gryphon" and "Stad Whale" have lighter restrictions, but do require that you make any Xyz monsters using other engines first, and prohibit the use of "[[Gravity Controller]]" to trigger "Patriarch"—although in some situations this can be mitigated by instead using "[[Eclipse Twins]]".
