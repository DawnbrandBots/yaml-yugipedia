  "'''Infernoid'''" (インフェルノイド, ''Inferunoido'') is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Fiend]] [[monster]]s that debuted in ''[[Secrets of Eternity]]''. This was the first archetype whose [[Monster Card|monsters]] were all [[Special Summon Monster]]s, until the release of "[[Infernoid Decatron]]" in ''[[Clash of Rebellions]]''. They are supported by the "[[Void]]" archetype of Spell and Trap Cards.

  {{Main|Master Guide 5 card storylines|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#No. 11: "Duel Terminal" World Side Story - Secret Maneuvers in Purgatory}}
  "<em>The messengers of the Inferno who burn everything in their path!!</em>"
  In times immemorial, these messengers of the inferno were sealed away inside the [[Naturia Sacred Tree|Sacred Tree of the Naturia]] along with the "[[Qli]]". Their forms are said to be based on those of ancient monsters who were seized and captured.<ref>[http://www.ygorganization.com/weaselstamersmagicarmorandinfernorobotsohmy/ The Organization] - New Duel Terminal World Lores</ref>

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  The revealed "Infernoid" monsters look like mechanical demons. Their designs incorporate vintage computer components (such as the [[wikipedia:Dekatron|decatron]]) and the descriptions of their corresponding demons (such as [[wikipedia:Adramelech|Adrammalech]] "[[Infernoid Attondel|Attondel]]" having the tail of a peacock). The armor on their bodies is also decorated with the thick, latticework lines, similar to those that also adorn the "[[Qli]]" monsters, from which the "Infernoids" emanate. In general, each "Infernoid" has a number of canisters (as seen in "[[Void Seer]]") on their body equal to their Level, and are colored according to the spheres of their corresponding "Qli" monster.

  === Etymology ===
  The name of the archetype is a combination of the words ''Inferno''/''Infernal'' and ''Void''.

  In the ''[[OCG]]'' — Each of the [[Level]] 7 and lower "Infernoid" monsters' names are corruptions of the names of Biblical/Kabbalistic demons, such as "Lucifuge" and "Beelzebub". The high-Level monsters, such as "Nehemoth" and "Adramelech", use non-corrupted versions. Their Spell and Trap Cards are named after the [[wikipedia:Purgatory|Purgatory]].

  In the ''[[TCG]]'' — Presumably to avoid references to the occult or demonic entities, each "Infernoid" monster is named after an ordinal number in a different language that corresponds to its own Level ("Antra", for example, means "second" in Lithuanian, while "Onuncu" is Turkish/Azerbaijani for "tenth"). Their Spell/Trap support is termed [[wikipedia:Void type|Void]].

  == Playing style ==
  "Infernoid" as a strategy revolves around sending large amounts of "Infernoid" Main Deck monsters from the Deck (less commonly from the hand) to the Graveyard, in order to set up the Summon requirements of their Main Deck monsters. The theme is directly supported by the "[[Void]]" Spell/Trap cards.

  "Infernoid" Main Deck monsters, excluding "[[Infernoid Decatron]]", cannot be Normal Summoned/Set, and must be Special Summoned by banishing a number of other "Infernoids" from the hand and/or Graveyard, while the combined Levels or Ranks of all Effect Monsters you control is 8 or less. These members can be divided by their levels into three sets:
  * Level 1-4: Can only be Special Summoned from the hand by banishing one "Infernoid". Provides various Ignition removal effects, and share the [[Quick Effect]] to Tribute a monster to banish 1 card in the opponent's Graveyard.
  * Level 5-8: Can be Special Summoned from the hand/GY by banishing two "Infernoids". Provides various combat-based offensive effects, and share the Tribute-banish Quick Effect as the Level 1-4 members.
  * Level 9-10: Can be Special Summoned from the hand/GY by banishing three "Infernoids". Provides board wipe effects on Summon, and Quick Effects to Tribute a monster to then negate and banish an activated card/effect.

  The only "Infernoid" [[Normal Summon Monster]] is "[[Infernoid Decatron]]", a [[Tuner Monster|Tuner]] monster that can send an "Infernoid" monster from your Deck to your Graveyard upon its summon to gain the sent monster's Level, and change its own name and effects to those of the sent monster. "Decatron" can be used both as a searcher and as a substitute boss monster.

  "Infernoid" Extra Deck monsters consist of "[[Infernoid Tierra]]", "[[Infernoid Evil]]", and "[[Infernoid Flood]]".
  * "Tierra" specifically synergizes with Fusing-from-Deck effects ("[[Void Imagination]]" in-theme-wise), allowing for the mass milling of in-Deck Fusion materials thanks to its uncapped material requirements.
  * "Evil" provides large amounts of "Infernoid" milling upon being Summoned.
  * "Flood" is a Link boss monster that provides a turn-1 interruption setup should the player succeed in swarming "Infernoid" monsters.

  The "Void" Spell/Trap support provide various searching, mass milling, recovery, utility, or Fusion Summoning effects, all searchable via "[[Void Vanishment]]". "[[Void Feast]]" in particular can tutor out multiple "Decatron" to provide large amounts of advantage and board building.

  Generally speaking, as of 2025, "Infernoid" decks focusing on milling "Infernoids" ''en masse'' in order to overwhelm the opponent with swarms of "Infernoid" monsters and high-impact boss monster effects. The Deck can easily OTK going second with its large amounts of board wipes and high ATK monsters, while going first the Deck can use its swarmed monsters for Link climbing (bypassing their on-field Level limit Summon restriction) to Summon Link boss monsters, such as the in-theme "Infernoid Flood".

  Key enablers of "Infernoid" mass milling include the following in-theme and external cards:
  * "Infernoid Tierra" + "Void Imagination", allowing Tierra to be Fusion Summoned with large amounts of "Infernoid" monsters from the Deck.
  * "Infernoid Evil". "[[Instant Fusion]]" can be used to turbo out "Infernoid Evil".
  * "[[Reasoning]]", "[[Monster Gate]]", "[[That Grass Looks Greener]]", staples that can mill large amounts of cards.
  * "[[Card Destruction]]", which cycles from the hand.
  * "[[Void Reignition]]", an in-theme "[[Card Destruction]]"

  Notably, due to the Deck's heavy synergy with the effects of "Reasoning" and "Monster Gate", which require a large amount of Main Deck [[Special Summon Monster]]s to function well, "Infernoids" synergize poorly with external milling engines that make use of Normal Summonable monsters, such as "[[Lightsworn]]".

  Aside from mass milling, other synergistic external engines include:
  * "[[Snake-Eye]]" engine, which can tutor out "Infernoid Decatron" and provide lots of materials for combo plays.
  * "[[Lair of Darkness]]", which can turn "Infernoids" Quick Effect Tribute effects into extra interruptions.
  * [[Activates from your Graveyard|Graveyard support]] to further capitalize on the theme's milling-centric playstyle.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The biggest way to counter "Infernoids" is to cut them off from banishing resources. They must banish cards from their hand or Graveyard in order to Special Summon themselves; cards that prevent banishing such as "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]", "[[Chaos Hunter]]", "[[Necrovalley]]", etc. can prevent "Infernoid" players from being able to banish cards, effectively preventing them from being able to Summon at all. This also cuts them off from additional support such as "[[Peropero Cerperus]]", "[[Galaxy Cyclone]]" and "[[Breakthrough Skill]]".
  * Cards that banish outright or that punish milling are also effective, such as "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]", "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", or "[[Earthshattering Event]]".
  * Cutting them off from Special Summoning by means of the "[[Djinn Releaser of Rituals|Djinn]] Lock" (currently Forbidden in the TCG), "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]" (also Forbidden in the TCG) or "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" can also shut down "Infernoids", since they cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. This forces "Infernoids" to rely on the very few monsters in their Deck they can Normal Summon/Set until they can get rid of the floodgate, forcing them to play slower and more defensively until they can remove it from the field.
  * Due to the low Trap Card count and occasional reliance on Spell Cards, cards that negate Spells such as "[[Imperial Order]]" can also slow down an "Infernoid" player.
  * Additionally, due to the large number of high level monsters in this deck, "[[Evilswarm Ophion]]" can prove to be an extremely bothersome monster (if one is able to Summon it).
