  "'''Jinzo'''", known as "'''Android'''" ({{Ruby|人|じん}}{{Ruby|造|ぞう}}{{Ruby|人|にん}}{{Ruby|間|げん}} ''Jinzōningen'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. Their [[Monster effect|effects]] revolve around the [[negate|negation]] of [[Trap Card]]s.

  == Appearances ==
  [[Espa Roba]] was the first character shown to use "Jinzo", and also used "[[Amplifier]]" to strengthen it. [[Joey Wheeler]] later won it off him and used it in many of his Duels. In the [[Virtual World (arc)|Virtual World]] arc, [[Leichter]] used "Jinzo" as his [[Deck Master]].
  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'', [[Jinzo (character)|Jinzo]] appears as a [[Duel Monster Spirit]] awakened by the school's occult club, seeking souls so he may exist in the human world. Jinzo is defeated by [[Jaden]] in a Duel and sent back to the [[Duel Monster Spirit World]].
  [[Makoto Inotsume]] also uses "Jinzo" cards in ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'', including "Jinzo - Returner" and "Jinzo - Lord", as part of his [[Jinzo Art]].

  == Playing style ==
  The main objective of this deck is to summon "Jinzo" to lock your opponent's Traps, with "Jinzo - Jector" being the best way to do it, either by using its own effect or by Special Summoning it (with a card like "[[Summoner Monk]]") and then using "[[Inferno Reckless Summon]]".
  More recent support helps drastically, as now "Jinzo" itself can be summoned much more easily, and the addition of "[[Jinzo the Machine Menace]]" now allows one to utilize [[Rank]] 6 [[Xyz Monster]]s as it reduces its own Level when Special Summoned via its effect, as long as there is a Trap on the field or in the GY. "[[Psychic Megacyber]]" can also help with using Rank 6 monsters, as well as [[Set]] an opposing [[Effect Monster]] as a [[Continuous Trap Card]] if it declares an attack on said monster. This helps with summoning "[[Jinzo - Layered]]", which can steal opposing monsters and Tribute them to destroy cards if a Trap is present. Meanwhile, "[[Psychic Bounder]]" is able to search ''any'' copies of "Jinzo" or a card listing the name in its text.
  "[[Law of the Cosmos]]" can allow for more searching on top of setting up the summon of "Jinzo the Machine Menace", while "[[Cosmos Channelling]]" can serve as a means to bring back any Machine monsters from the GY once per your turn. It can also draw 1 card during the opponent’s [[Draw Phase]] if the right card type is declared. "[[Cyber Energy Shock]]" can destroy a Spell/Trap during either player’s turn, but with the added bonus of negating a card’s effects or boosting the ATK of "Jinzo" by 800 if specifically a Trap was destroyed. "[[Everlasting Alloy]]" is another Quick-Play Spell that can negate effects targeting your Machine monsters, or prevent them from being destroyed by battle or card effect. Lastly, "[[Psychic Wave]]" can return any Machine monster from the GY to your hand as well as send "Jinzo" to the GY for later.

  === Weakness ===
  As the archetype has the effect that negates Traps, "[[Double Snare]]" can potentially take them out of the field. Their effects also still allows the use Quick-Play Spells, which could prove to be a disadvantage if faced with a card such as "[[Super Polymerization]]". "Amplifier" can become mandatory if one would want to use Trap Cards themselves. As all of them are Machine Monsters, anti-Machine cards like "[[Acid Rain]]" can give problems to "Jinzo".
