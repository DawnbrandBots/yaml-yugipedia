  "'''Icejade'''" ({{Ruby|氷|ヒ}}{{Ruby|水|スイ}} ''Hisui'') is an [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Aqua]] monsters introduced in ''[[Burst of Destiny]]''.

  == Etymology ==
  The Japanese name for this archetype, 「{{Ruby|氷|ヒ}}{{Ruby|水|スイ}}」 (''Hisui'') is a play on 「氷」 (''Hyou'', "ice") and 「水」 (''Sui'', "water"). The kanji 「氷」 is applied with one of its alternative readings, ''hi'', so that the name's combined reading forms ''Hisui'' (ヒスイ, lit. "jade").

  The "Icejade" monsters are named after members of two different silicate groups: monoclinic amphiboles and monoclinic pyroxenes. These two silicate groups are respectively associated with the two main types of jade: nephrite and jadeite.

  The "Icejade Creation" monsters are based on animals whose names have associations or similarities with jade. The kanji for jade (翡翠 ''hisui'') originates from the Chinese word for [[wikipedia:Kingfisher|kingfisher birds]] ("[[Icejade Creation Kingfisher]]"). The name of the prehistoric [[wikipedia:Aegirocassis|aegirocassis]] ("[[Icejade Creation Aegirocassis]]") is phonetically similar to the name of the mineral [[wikipedia:Aegirine|aegirine]]

  == Design ==
  The "Icejade" monsters are feminine humanoids made out of a crystalline substance with water-like properties. At the end of their lifespans, they condense and harden into patterned black crystals, which are then used to forge the swords wielded by the "[[Swordsoul]]" monsters. This is also reflected in the appearance of the humanoid members, with the visually youngest "[[Icejade Aegirine|Aegirine]]" having an almost entirely white body, and the visually oldest "[[Icejade Kosmochlor|Kosmochlor]]" being almost entirely blackened.

  Several "Icejade" monsters wear ornaments modeled after [[wikipedia:Strongylodon macrobotrys|jade vines]], a plant that is native to their home, as depicted in "[[Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle]]".

  The "Icejade" monsters based on pyroxene silicates wear crowns to represent their statuses as royalty. This also reflects jadeite's status as a higher-quality jade.

  == Playing style ==
  "Icejade" is an archetype that has a defensive strategy, stalling the opponent's moves by hampering their monsters' effect activation and severely reducing their [[ATK]] during battles. "[[Icejade Cenote Enion Cradle]]" and "[[Icejade Kosmochlor]]" are vital pieces to the [[Deck]]'s strategy, with the former recycling used cards and debuffing the opponent's monsters, and the latter being able to Summon itself while the former is on the [[field]], while granting an effect limiter and even more debuffs to the opponent's monsters. "[[Icejade Creation Kingfisher]]" lets the [[equip]]ped monster attack using their higher [[DEF]] instead of its ATK, which in tandem with "Kosmochlor" and "Enion Cradle", makes for a very powerful attacker that can get over most monsters. In addition, "Kingfisher" can also bounce problematic monsters that are resilient to destruction and has a good 2500 ATK that synergizes excellently with "Enion Cradle's" debuff effect. "[[Icejade Curse]]" adds a layer of offense to the Deck by [[burn]]ing the opponent whenever a monster is [[destroy]]ed by battle involving an "Icejade" monster; this lets "Icejade" monsters pack more punch with each battle, destroying a debuffed high-ATK monster to severely burn the opponent with said high ATK after. Its first effect is more situational, but when setup, it may completely lock the opponent from using the effect of Summoned monsters at all, putting them at a severe disadvantage.

  To assist in assembling the pieces needed for the Deck's strategy, the Deck's other monsters and [[Spell]]/[[Trap]] supports are necessary. "[[Icejade Aegirine]]" and "[[Icejade Acti]]" both help with setup, the former tutoring an "Icejade" Spell/Trap while the latter ditches a [[WATER]] monster and lets the player draw a card. "Aegirine" can also [[Special Summon]] another WATER monster from the [[hand]] when it's targeted for an attack or card effect, which can be used to trigger the on-Summon effect of other monsters, such as "Acti" or even "[[Crystal Girl]]". Both "[[Icejade Tinola]]" and "[[Icejade Tremora]]" deal with Summoning monsters onto the field quickly, the former from the [[GY]] and the latter from the hand. All of the [[Level]] 5 or lower monsters, except "Aegirine", are also able to [[banish]] themselves with their second effects if a [[face-up]] WATER monster the player controls is destroyed, which works well with both "[[Icejade Cradle]]", so it can search out the same copy that just banished themselves, and "[[Icejade Erosion]]", which can be used to disrupt the opponent's plays by destroying an "Icejade" monster to [[negate]] the effects of an opponent's face-up card.

  Outside of the archetype, both "Crystal Girl" and "[[True King Bahrastos, the Fathomer]]" play well with this Deck; the former is able to Special Summon herself from the GY when the player controls "Kosmochlor" or "Kingfisher" to add one or the other during the [[End Phase]], and the latter can trigger the banishing effects of the Level 5 or lower monsters with its self-Special Summon effect. Both "[[Ice Barrier (card)|Ice Barrier]]" and "[[The Ice-Bound God]]" can also complement "Kosmochlor" and "Kingfisher", either by tutoring them or supporting the Deck's main strategy. If desired, "[[Genex Undine]]" can be used to dump the Level 5 or lower monsters to use their banish effects later, and "[[Genex Controller]]" unlocks the potential for [[Synchro Summon]]ing Level 6, 7 or 8 monsters with them. "[[Wall of Revealing Light]]" can be used as a [[floodgate]] in tandem with "Enion Cradle", to prevent the opponent from attacking.
