  "'''Favorite'''" (フェイバリット ''Feibaritto'') is a ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|TCG]]''/''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game|OCG]]''-original [[archetype]] of cards that support the archetypes used by [[Jaden Yuki]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime.

  == Playing style ==
  "Favorite" cards support the "[[HERO]]" ("[[Elemental HERO]]" in particular) and "[[Yubel (archetype)|Yubel]]" archetypes. For "HERO" support, "[[Favorite Hero]]" is an [[Equip Spell Card]] can search [[Field Spell Card]]s and protect Level 5 or higher "HERO" monsters from being targeted by the opponent's card effects while there was a Field Spell is present, while "[[Favorite Contact]]" is a [[Normal Trap Card]] can Summon a Fusion Monster that lists a "HERO" monster by recycling the materials back into the Deck.

  The archetype is supported by "[[Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage]]", a [[Fusion Monster]] which requires two "Elemental HERO" monsters with different [[Attribute]]s, which can search or recycle one of the archetype's cards upon its Special Summon. It can then Tribute itself to Special Summon an "Elemental HERO" monster that cannot be Normal Summoned/Set from the Deck or Extra Deck if it was Fusion Summoned using a Normal Monster as material. One ideal choice to Summon is the "Favorite" archetype's own "[[Winged Kuriboh LV6]]" which can be used as [[Link Material]] for a [[Link Summon]], then Special Summon itself back from the GY by banishing "Infernal Rage" as a piece of disruption.

  For "Yubel", "[[Eternal Favorite]]" serves as a means of reviving a "Yubel" monster, then it can send itself to the GY allow a Fusion Summon using monsters from either field. While "Eternal Favorite" is supported by "Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage", the "HERO" and "Yubel" archetypes have minimal synergy with each other.

  == Trivia ==
  * With the exception of "[[Eternal Favorite]]", all members and support for the "Favorite" archetype depict "[[Elemental HERO Flame Wingman]]" or one of its counterparts in their artworks. The archetype's name and its connection to the said card may be a reference to the numerous instances in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime where the series' protagonist [[Jaden Yuki]] (who uses "[[Elemental Hero Flame Wingman (later anime)|Elemental HERO Flame Wingman]]" as one of his signature cards) has described it as "his favorite monster".
  ** "Eternal Favorite" references Jaden's bond with [[Yubel (character)|Yubel]], whom he reconciled with at the end of their final Duel. "[[Yubel (anime)|Yubel]]" was his favorite card during his childhood, although the spirit within the card inflicted pain on his opponents whenever he played the card itself as a testament of its overprotectiveness towards Jaden.
  * In the ''[[TCG]]'', the "Favorite" archetype's support cards refer to it using this phrasing for archetypes: "''card with "Favorite" in its name''". This is similar to but not the same as the pre-[[Simplified Effect Text]] phrasing for [[archetype]] support: "''card(s) that include "[archetype]" in their names''". It was likely intended to use this phrase to remove ambiguity between the cards from this archetype and a person's favorite card in general.
