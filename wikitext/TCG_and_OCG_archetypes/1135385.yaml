  "'''Hecahands'''", known as "'''Hecatoncheir'''" (ヘカトンケイル ''Hekatonkeiru'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an archetype of [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] [[Illusion]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Phantom Revengers]]''. 

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The archetype is named after the [[wikipedia:Hecatoncheires|Hecatoncheires]] ("Hundred-handed ones"), a group of three hundred-armed giants from Greek mythology.

  The archetype's "hand" theme is also a reference to the star [[wikipedia:Betelgeuse|Betelgeuse (α Orionis)]]. The traditional name Betelgeuse is said to be derived from Arabic names: ''Ibṭ al-Jawzā' '' ("Armpit of the Central One"), ''Yad al-Jawzā' '' ("Hand of the Central One") or ''Mankib al-Jawzā' '' ("Shoulder of the Central One"). Betelgeuse is also identified as the dwelling place of the [[wikipedia:Cthulhu Mythos deities#Elder Gods|Elder Gods]] in [[wikipedia:Cthulhu Mythos|Cthulhu Mythos]].

  The archetype's [[DARK]] monsters are named after the Hecatoncheires, while the [[LIGHT]] monsters are named after the Arabic names for Betelgeuse.

  == Playing style ==
  The archetype is thematically tied around using the opponent's cards. The Level 7 monsters can Summon monsters from one of the opponent's hand, Deck, or GY, and "[[Hecahands Xeno]]" can Summon from the opposing Extra Deck as a Quick Effect. In addition, if "Xeno" is destroyed by opposing card effect, it can take control of the opponent's field. The Counter Traps can negate an effect and Set that card.

  The main consistency tools are the Level 6 monsters, with "[[Hecahands Ibtel]]", "[[Hecahands Yadel]]" can shuffle themselves back to tutor a monster or search a Spell/Trap respectively, "[[Hecahands Makibel]]" can Fusion Summon using itself in the hand, "[[The Hidden Hecahands]]", which can search a monster and (at the cost of another card) Set a Spell/Trap, and "[[Hecahands Jauzah]]", which can be Contact Fused with an Illusion monster and a monster taken by the opponent, and can search any card in the archetype.
