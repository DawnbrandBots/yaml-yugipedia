  == Playing style ==
  "Ghostrick" is a predominantly Control archetype that revolves around flipping monsters (both yours and your opponent's) up and down. Their typical gameplan is to whittle the opponent's LP through a prolonged game, attacking directly through the effects of "[[Ghostrick Mansion]]" or "[[Ghostrick Museum]]", while protecting their face-down monsters and locking down the opponent. Once a lockdown is established, there are alternate ways to win, including burn, mill, and, most recently, an [[Ghostrick Angel of Mischief|Alternative Win Condition]].

  All of the Main Deck monsters have a common effect:
  : ''"Cannot be Normal Summoned, unless you control a "Ghostrick" monster. Once per turn: You can change this card to face-down Defense Position"''.
  Also, the Xyz Monsters, except for "[[Ghostrick Socuteboss]]" and "[[Ghostrick Angel of Mischief]]", share the following common effect:
  : ''"If this card is sent to the Graveyard: You can target 1 other "Ghostrick" card in your Graveyard; add that target to your hand"''.

  The three strata of monsters each follow a set of general effect guidelines:
  * The Fiend Level 1 monsters have effects that trigger while in the hand, and they react to destruction, attacks and damage, providing bonuses and acting like hand traps; design-wise, they share a prankster, infantile appearance, maybe hinting to the "tricks" they play against the attacks of the opponent's monsters.
  * The Spellcaster Level 2 monsters have effects related to Battle Position control, allowing its controller to [[Ghostrick Doll|search]] for a monster or [[Ghostrick Nekomusume|stall]] the opponent's moves; they share a feminine, delicate, appearance.
  * The Zombie Level 3 monsters all provide useful bonuses while they are face-up or when flipped face-up. Their effects range from [[Ghostrick Jiangshi|searching]] to [[Ghostrick Warwolf|burning]], or even [[Ghostrick Skeleton|milling the opponent's deck]] or [[Ghostrick Ghoul|giving bulk]] to a "Ghostrick" monster; their motif is basically of male figures of Halloween and Folklore.

  Most of the Ghostrick monsters aren't strong by themselves, thus they're left relying heavily on getting "[[Ghostrick Mansion]]" on the board as soon as possible in order to launch several consecutive direct attacks early in the game. Since "Mansion" also protects any face-down monsters from attacks, it is easy to repeatedly activate Ghostrick monster's effects like "[[Ghostrick Jiangshi]]" and "[[Ghostrick Witch]]". "[[Ghostrick Scare]]", "[[Floodgate Trap Hole]]" and "[[Swords of Concealing Light]]" are also useful in this deck to provide disruptions and lockdown.

  The support provided by the on-theme Spell/Trap Cards is also diverse, with effects that range from [[Ghostrick Vanish|protecting]] "Ghostrick" monsters from targeting and destroying effects, [[Ghostrick Scare|switching]] the battle position of opposing monsters, [[Ghostrick Break|reviving]] "Ghostrick" monsters and [[Ghostrick Night|locking]] the opponent from Flip Summoning. The only Spell Cards of the Deck is a trio of Field Spell Cards that share the common effect of allowing a player from attacking direcly if all opposing monsters are in face-down Defense Position. They can either [[Ghostrick Parade|search]] for resources, [[Ghostrick Museum|halve]] the battle damage and [[Ghostrick Museum|manipulating]] the battle position of the opponent's monsters.

  The archetype could also be used as an engine to Summon "[[Number F0: Utopic Draco Future]]" in any Deck that can make Rank 1-3 monsters. Summon a "Ghostrick" Xyz, then use it as material to Summon "[[Ghostrick Angel of Mischief]]", which can search "[[Ghostrick Shot]]". "Shot" can revive the detached Xyz, which can be used as material for another "Angel of Mischief". The two "Angel of Mischiefs" can be used to make "[[Number F0: Utopic Future]]" and thus "Draco Future".

  === Ghostrick Mill ===
  This Deck focus on [[mill]]ing your opponent's Deck and win by [[Deck out]]. "[[Ghostrick Parade]]" is the only recommended Field because of its searching effect and damage to your opponent is unecessary. Note that sending cards to your opponent's Graveyard may help their strategy, so "[[Ghostrick Skeleton]]" and "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" are used to banish the cards instead.

  === Weaknesses ===
  Despite this archetype's unorthodox "bait and switch" tactics, "Ghostricks" have many weaknesses.

  * The archetype is very slow for the modern game. A large portion of the archetype is focused on flip effects and battle-related effects; both have become less relevant as the game sped up.
  * The archetype relies on flipping its monsters down, and aims to control the board by repeatedly flipping opponent's monsters down. Therefore, cards that prevent the opponent from Setting or flipping (like "[[Dark Simorgh]]", "[[Searchlightman]]", and "[[Light of Intervention]]"), or cards that prevent your cards from being flipped down, are effective.
  ** The debut of [[Link Monster]]s has further aggravated this, as they are very common monsters that cannot be flipped down.
  * Most "Ghostricks" depends on their [[Field Spell Card]]s, "[[Ghostrick Mansion]]" and "[[Ghostrick Museum]]", to deal damage, and will struggle to do much [[Battle damage]] to your opponent without it, due to most of them having low ATK stats. This can be even worse with cards like "[[Spell Shattering Arrow]]" and "[[Eradicator Epidemic Virus]]" around.
  ** Cards like "[[Stardust Dragon]]", "[[Malefic Stardust Dragon]]" or "[[Stardust Spark Dragon]]" can be used to protect it.
  ** [[Ancient Gear]] Decks in particular will chew through Ghostricks, due to their ability to prevent the activation of the trap cards and effects that Ghostricks heavily rely on.

  == Trivia ==
  * The "Ghostrick" monsters' battle-flipping effects resemble the activities of children pranksters or mischievous spirits: popping out and scaring people, then running away and hiding. This is underscored by the archetype name "Ghostrick" a blatant portmanteau of the words "ghost" and "trick".
  * The "Ghostrick" archetype was originally released in ''[[Shadow Specters]]'', which debuted in the U.S. in November 2013, and may have been intended to coincide with the celebration of [[wikipedia:Halloween|Halloween]]. The "Ghostrick" monsters are largely based on mythological creatures that children in the western world would dress up as for Halloween (witch, ghost, Jack-O'-Lantern, Frankenstein's Monster, Mummy, etc.), and their playstyle (as described above) mirrors the tradition of trick-or-treating.
  ** Most monsters of the "Ghostrick" archetype are [[Effect Monster]]s or [[Xyz Monster]]s, whose card frames are orange and black, respectively, the traditional colors of Halloween.
  * "Ghostrick" monsters' artworks share the background scheme with the "[[Lightsworn]]s", as they have the same concept of patterning.
