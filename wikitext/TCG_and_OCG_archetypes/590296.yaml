  "'''Time Thief'''", known in the ''[[OCG]]'' as "'''Chronodiver'''" (クロノダイバー ''Kuronodaibā''), is an [[archetype]] of [[Level 4 Monster Cards|Level]]/[[Rank 4 Monster Cards|Rank 4]] [[DARK]] [[Psychic]]/[[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] introduced in ''[[Savage Strike]]'' as a [[TCG Exclusive]]. They also have connections to the "[[S-Force]]" archetype, as seen in "[[S-Force Showdown]]".

  ==Design==
  The Psychic members are scientists with clothing to match, wearing uniforms and glasses befitting of their time travel theme. The Machine members primarily take on the appearance of robotic animals doubling as time travel gadgets, bar "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" which as one can surmise is a ship.

  They appear to take inspiration from the science fiction series ''[[wikipedia:Doctor Who|Doctor Who]]'', the manhua/anime series ''[[wikipedia:Chronos Ruler|Chronos Ruler]]'', and the book series ''[[wikipedia:The Gideon Trilogy|Gideon Trilogy]]''.

  ==Playing Style==
  Their main strategy is to swarm the board with [[Level]] 4 monsters and [[attach]] different [[card type]]s, including the opponent's cards, to their ace monster, the [[Rank]] 4 [[Xyz Monster]] "[[Time Thief Redoer]]". The Machine members tend to [[Tribute]] themselves to aid with this. To accomplish this, "[[Time Thief Winder]]" is able to [[add]] "Time Thief" cards from the [[Deck]] to your [[hand]], making it a valuable asset. This can be done by [[Normal Summon]]ing it, or by [[Special Summon]]ing it via detaching [[material]] from an Xyz Monster you control. Alternatively, you could use the effect of "[[Time Thief Regulator]]" to Tribute itself (while controlling no other monsters) to immediately Special Summon "Winder" and another "Time Thief" from the Deck. "Regulator" can also revive itself from the [[GY]] if an Xyz Monster you control is [[destroyed by battle]], though be careful as it will [[banish]] itself when it [[leaves the field]] after doing so. "[[Time Thief Chronocorder]]" will do the same though it can Tribute itself during your opponent's [[Battle Phase]] to make them take [[battle damage]] that turn if they continue to [[attack]]. 
  "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" Tributes itself to [[attach]] cards from the opponent's GY to your "Time Thief" Xyz Monsters (effectively acting as a tribal "[[D.D. Crow]]"), but can also [[detach]] those materials to bring itself back to the [[field]]. Said Xyz Monsters are "[[Time Thief Perpetua]]" and "Redoer"; "Perpetua" can Special Summon "Time Thief" Monsters from your GY during your [[Standby Phase]]s, as well as [[target]] another Xyz Monster of yours and attach 1 "Time Thief" card from your Deck to it. This makes her perfectly capable of supplying "Redoer" with the needed materials for his own effects (and other powerful Xyz Monsters, for that matter), as he is able to detach up to 3 different kinds of materials from himself to activate the corresponding effects: detaching a monster banishes "Redoer" until the [[End Phase]], a [[Spell]] will let you [[draw]] 1 card, and a [[Trap]] will place a [[face-up]] Card the opponent controls on the top of their Deck. Given this is a [[Quick Effect]], this allows "Redoer" to become tricky to deal with on top of him being able to snatch cards from the top of your opponent's Deck each Standby Phase.

  "[[Time Thief Startup]]" is a [[Quick-Play Spell]] that lets you immediately [[Summon]] a "Time Thief" monster from your hand, instantly triggering the effect of "Winder" or setting up "Regulator"; it is also able to banish itself from the GY to supply your "Time Thief" Xyz Monsters with all 3 materials needed for their effects, making it highly valuable. "[[Time Thief Hack]]" is a [[Continuous Spell]] that protects your Xyz Monsters from being destroyed or targeted by opposing effects the turn they are Summoned, on top of letting you boost your monster's [[ATK]] by 300 for each material it has, but also lets them attack directly if at least 1 of their materials belongs to the opponent. "[[Time Thief Flyback]]" is a [[Normal Trap]] that can be used to supply your "Time Thief" Xyz Monsters with material from the hand or Deck, and can banish itself after this to attach any card in your opponent's GY to your monsters as material (similar to the aforementioned "Bezel Ship"). "[[Time Thief Retrograde]]" is a [[Counter Trap]] that can [[negate]] the activation of opposing Spells/Traps and, instead of destroying them, turns them into material for monsters, thus making it a powerful option against cards that would benefit from being in the GY.

  The [[Continuous Trap]] "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" has great synergy with the card "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]" (searched by "[[Xyz Armor Fortress]]", which can be easily made given the archetype's ease of making Rank 4's with which to overlay for said "Armor Fortress") by allowing the player to Xyz Summon a Rank 4 during the opponent's turn, especially a "Redoer" or "Double Barrel" with their respective spin and negation effects immediately online. Furthermore, it adds another method of non-targeting removal as its GY effect by banishing a card on the field as a "[[Spell Speed 2]]" effect, provided the user's Xyz Monster(s) is supplied with a Spell and Trap as material.

  The archetype has great synergy with the "[[Heraldic]]" archetype, which supports both Psychic and Machine Decks. As all members are of the DARK Attribute, they also benefit from generic DARK support as well as some Machine support like "[[Gear Gigant X]]". "[[Raidraptor]]" and "[[Phantom Knights]]" can also prove a boon for the deck, by searching/tutoring other Level 4 DARK monsters to extend Special Summons and/or setting up cards in the GY and backrow to do the same. "[[Raidraptor - Force Strix]]" in particular can search extender monsters like "[[Raidraptor - Singing Lanius|Singing Lanius]]", "[[Raidraptor - Strangle Lanius|Strangle Lanius]]", and "[[Raider's Wing]]" to allow for additional Level 4 monsters with which to Xyz Summon with, while "[[The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche|Rusty Bardiche]]" can send monsters like "Raider's Wing" to the GY in order to set "[[The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine|Shade Brigandine]]" for the same purpose.

  Generic Xyz Monster support can also work amazingly well with the Deck, such as "[[Overlay Regen]]" and "[[Xyz Reborn]]". This extends to other generic [[Rank 4 Monster Cards|Rank 4 monsters]] in general, including "[[Abyss Dweller]]" and "[[Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir]]" to limit the opponent's actions, "[[Tornado Dragon]]" for backrow removal, and "[[Number 60: Dugares the Timeless]]" to extend the user's plays.

  === Sample Combos ===
  "Time Thief" can work well as an engine for fellow Xyz archetypes, and vice versa. Its synergy with "Raidraptor" in particular can allow for easy Summoning of "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]" using "[[Rank-Up-Magic Soul Shave Force]]", in addition to their existing plays.

  Below is a sample combo with the following objectives:
  # Summon an untargetable "[[Time Thief Redoer]]" with a Trap attached to act as a scout for the opponent's Deck as well as "spin" removal.
  # Place "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" and "[[Time Thief Flyback]]" in the GY as forms of interruption to both [[banish]] an opponent's card and attach 1 card from the opponent's GY as material to a "Time Thief" Xyz Monster.
  # Summon "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" to act as an additional GY interruption.
  # Use "[[Xyz Armor Fortress]]" and "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]" to search "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]" and subsequently attach an opponent's monster to it upon equipping one Xyz Monster to another.
  # Summon "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]" as an end piece and enabler for "[[Raidraptor - Strangle Lanius]]" to make an additional Xyz Monster.

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Time Thief Regulator]]"
  | end     = "[[Time Thief Redoer]]" and "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]" (both with "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" attached), "[[Time Thief Perpetua]]", "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]" and "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" in the Monster Zone + "[[Time Thief Flyback]]" and "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]" in the GY
  | steps   = 
  # Normal Summon "[[Time Thief Regulator]]" as your only monster, Tributing it afterward to Summon "[[Time Thief Winder]]" and "[[Time Thief Adjuster]]" (or "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" if "Adjuster" is in your hand).
  # Use "Winder's" effect to search "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]", and "Adjuster's" effect to send "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" from Deck to GY.
  # Overlay both monsters for "[[Raidraptor - Force Strix]]" and use its effect to detach one material to search "[[Raidraptor - Singing Lanius]]".
  # Revive "Bezel Ship" in GY by detaching "Force Strix's" remaining material, then Summon "Singing Lanius" from your hand.
  # Link Summon "[[Raidraptor - Wise Strix]]" using "Force Strix" and "Singing Lanius", then use its effect to Summon "[[Raider's Wing]]" from Deck.
  # Overlay "Bezel Ship" and "Raider's Wing" for a second "Force Strix", then use its effect to detach "Wing" and not only search "[[Raidraptor - Strangle Lanius]]" but activate "Wise Strix's" second effect to Set "[[Rank-Up-Magic Soul Shave Force]]" from Deck.
  # Activate "Soul Shave Force" to revive the first "Force Strix" from GY and overlay it into "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]", who will target "Wise Strix" to attach as material and free up the Extra Monster Zone.
  # Revive "Raider's Wing" in GY with its effect by detaching "Force Strix's" remaining material.
  # Overlay "Force Strix" into "[[Xyz Armor Fortress]]" in the Extra Monster Zone and use its effect to detach a material and search "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]" for you to Set. Afterwards, overlay "Fortress" into "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]".
  # Activate "Strangle Lanius" in hand to Summon itself, then use its second effect to revive "Singing Lanius" in GY, and overlay both into "[[Time Thief Perpetua]]", whose effect you will use to attach a second "Power Reserve" from Deck to "Infinity" as material.
  # Pass turn, then during your opponent's Standby Phase activate "Power Reserve" to Summon itself and a second "Bezel Ship" from the Deck and activate "Full-Armored Xyz" immediately after to overlay "Power Reserve" and "Raider's Wing" into "[[Time Thief Redoer]]" (doing so will make "Redoer" untargetable by card effects via "Raider's Wing's" effect).
  # Use "Redoer's" effect to attach the opponent's top card of Deck, then use "Perpetua's" to detach a material and revive "Adjuster" from GY, which will send "[[Time Thief Flyback]]" from the Deck to the GY.
  # After detaching "Power Reserve" from either "Redoer" or "Infinity", use "Perpetua" to attach "[[Time Thief Startup]]" to the other, enabling the GY effect of "Power Reserve".

  ===Weaknesses===
  As effective as the "Time Thief" monsters can be in providing out-of-the-box interactions with the opponent, they suffer a great weakness to cards such as the "[[Yo-kai Girl|Ghost Girls]]" (namely "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" and "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]"). A well-timed activation of such cards on the opponent's end can easily stop the effects of "Regulator" and "Redoer" in particular dead in their tracks, and the Deck's setup/strategy by proxy. The card "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" can also prove a major problem for them by preventing them from [[Xyz Summon|Xyz Summoning]] outright, therefore locking them out of both their ace and toolbox monsters.

  Furthermore, the Deck often requires use of supplementary archetypes and/or "free agent" cards to get the ball rolling when it comes to providing necessary monsters for setup. Hence why more often than not, "Time Thief" is found in joint builds alongside archetypes such as "[[Heraldic Beast]]", "[[Phantom Knights]]", "[[Onomat]]", and "[[Gunkan]]".
