  "'''Time Thief'''", known as "'''Chronodiver'''" (クロノダイバー ''Kuronodaibā'') in Japan and Korea, is an [[archetype]] of [[Level 4 Monster Cards|Level]]/[[Rank 4 Monster Cards|Rank 4]] [[DARK]] [[Psychic]]/[[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] introduced in ''[[Savage Strike]]'' as a [[TCG Exclusive]]. They also have connections to the "[[S-Force]]" archetype, as seen in "[[S-Force Showdown]]".

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#The Girl who Crossed Over Time}}

  == Design ==
  "Time Thief" monsters consist of human characters (Psychic monsters) and robots (Machine monsters). The human characters consist of three individuals: "[[Time Thief Redoer]]", a white-haired, brown-eyed man dressed as a high-tech phantom thief, "[[Time Thief Winder]]", a gray-haired, blue-eyed man dressed like a high-tech agent, and "[[Time Thief Perpetua]]", a brown-haired, blue-eyed girl who is usually dressed as a scientist.

  The Machine members primarily take on the appearance of robotic animals who can transform into high-tech gadgets (alternate form visible in their background artworks), bar "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]", which seems to be a non-transforming ship. Based on the ''Valuable Book EX 4'' card storyline and the card artwork present in "Time Thief" cards, it can be surmised that the trio of "Redoer", "Winder", and "Perpetua" are a trio of high-tech, time traveling agents who perform missions across time, using "Bezel Ship" as a time machine and assisted by their transforming gadgets (the Machine monsters).

  In particular, several "Time Thief" cards depict "Perpetua" at different points in her life, where she is either a young girl being saved by future "Time Thief" agents or an official member of the group helping the team develop its gadgets. The story suggests that the future "Perpetua" used her knowledge of the future to ensure her survival and the creation of the "Time Thief" gadgets in the past, forming a bootstrap paradox.

  Almost all "Time Thief" "story" artworks feature an icon of a logo that incorporates design elements of a clock face, a compass, and gears, suggested to either be the icon of the group or the symbol that indicates the group's activation of time travel powers.

  They appear to take inspiration from the manhua/anime series ''[[wikipedia:Chronos Ruler|Chronos Ruler]]'', and the book series ''[[wikipedia:The Gideon Trilogy|Gideon Trilogy]]''. Most notably in the case of ''Chronos Ruler'', "Redoer" seems to bear heavy resemblance to series protagonist [[wikia:w:c:chronosruler:Victor Putin|Victor Putin]].

  '''Spells/Traps'''

  The Spells and Traps bear artwork chronicling "[[Time Thief Perpetua|Perpetua]]" as attempts on her life and research are thwarted by "[[Time Thief Winder|Winder]]" and "[[Time Thief Redoer|Redoer]]", eventually inspiring her to join their cause with the aid and tutelage of her future self (as seen in the artwork of "[[Time Thief Adjuster]]"). They feature a diverse array of supportive effects; most also have a secondary supportive effect, more often than not involving banishing themselves from GY.

  == Playing style ==
  "Time Thief" is a [[Rank 4]] [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]]-based archetype with a focus on [[attach]]ing different [[card type]]s, including the opponent's cards, to its Xyz Monsters as materials, and deriving beneficial effects from it.

  At the Deck's core is their ace monster, the Rank 4 "[[Time Thief Redoer]]", who can attach top card of the opponent's [[Deck]] to itself and gain advantage by detaching materials of different card types as a [[Quick Effect]]: temporarily [[banish]] self for Monsters, draw one for Spells, and non-Targeting [[spin]] removal for Traps. "[[Time Thief Perpetua]]" meanwhile provides support to "Redoer" by providing it with revival and additional materials of any desired card type. Lastly, "[[Time Thief Double Barrel]]" provides additional interruptions, but is less flexible than "Redoer".

  The "Time Thief" Main Deck monsters meant to facilitate the summon of "Redoer" includes the following key monsters:

  * "[[Time Thief Regulator]]": Advantage-generating searcher; can banish itself to summon 2 "Time Thief" monsters from the Deck.
  * "[[Time Thief Winder]]": Searcher, extender from hand
  * "[[Time Thief Adjuster]]": Send-to-GY searcher, OR extender from hand

  The other "Time Thief" Machine monsters have only situational effects; most can Special Summon themselves from the GY, but cannot easily send themselves to the GY, and typically require additional setup for self-revival, making them inefficient as extenders. However, consistent combos that make use of "Adjuster"'s searching effect may be able to make use of their specific self-revival effects as combo pieces. On the field, "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" is the only member among them with an interruption effect.

  "Time Thief" Spell/Trap cards provide various levels of field support. Since they are only searchable in a usable form by "Winder", they are usually only tutored out as end pieces. The strongest member is "[[Time Thief Flyback]]", who provides advantage and a from-GY interruption. Other "Time Thief" Spell/Traps also have GY-activated interruption effects; they can be tutored out using "Perpetua"'s attach-from-Deck effect or "Adjuster".

  "Time Thief" cards impose no xenolocks whatsoever, and all of its Xyz monsters have generic materials, meaning the Deck can easily make use of external Rank 4 engines to turbo out its boss monsters, and also make use of external Rank 4 boss monsters. "Redoer" in particular benefits from Level 4 [[Trap Monster]]s due to its effect. Synergistic external engines/packages/singletons include:

  * "[[The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine]]", an easily-Summoned Level 4 Trap Monster.
  * "[[Onomat]]", allowing easy access to Level/Rank 4 extenders (only a few of which impose a "soft-lock" into Xyz Monsters, meaning one can still [[Link Summon]] supplementary monsters before using said extenders' effects).
  * "[[Heraldic Beast]]", potent resource engine with incidental Machine/Psychic typing synergies
  * "[[Raidraptor]]" and "[[Phantom Knights]]", providing more Rank 4 boss monster options, "Shade Brigandine" access, and DARK Attribute synergy
  * "[[Armored Xyz (archetype)|Armored Xyz]]", accessible via any Rank 4 and allowing "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]" to immediately turn "Power Reserve" into a Rank 4 during the opponent's turn.
  * "[[Sakitama]]" as a generic Level 4 extender
  * "[[Small World]]" as a generic searcher (using "Sakitama" as a bridge)
  * "[[Silhouhatte Rabbit]]", a searcher for "Power Reserve"
  * Generic DARK, Psychic, and/or Machine support (e.g. "[[Gear Gigant X]]")
  * Generic Xyz Monster support (e.g. "[[Overlay Regen]]", "[[Xyz Reborn]]")

  === Strengths ===
  * '''Concise and versatile [[Main Deck]] engine''' - The Main Deck monsters and their self-Summon/extension effects allow them to be splashed in a number of fellow Xyz Decks, aided by their one true required Normal Summon in "Regulator" which leaves greater room for other Xyz enablers that do not necessarily require a Normal Summon to go live.
  * '''Unconventional interaction''' - The "spin" and "GY steal" effects of cards such as "Redoer" and "Bezel Ship" provide a unique type of disruption, given few cards bear immunity to being returned to the Deck and the aforementioned "GY steal" effects target "Time Thief" monsters; not the card(s) in GY one intends to steal.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * '''Susceptibility to particular handtraps or staples''' - "Time Thief" monsters suffer a great weakness to cards such as the "[[Yo-kai Girl|Ghost Girls]]" (namely "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" and "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]"). A well-timed activation of such cards on the opponent's end can easily stop the effects of "Regulator" and "Redoer" in particular dead in their tracks, and the Deck's setup/strategy by proxy. 
  * '''Limited independent performance capacity''' - The pure "Time Thief" engine doesn't provide a significant amount of card advantage, meaning the Deck often requires use of supplementary archetypes and/or "free agent" cards to get the ball rolling when it comes to providing necessary monsters for setup. Hence why more often than not, "Time Thief" is found in joint builds alongside archetypes such as "[[Heraldic Beast]]", "[[Phantom Knights]]", "[[Onomat]]", and "[[Gunkan]]" to name a few.
  * '''Manipulation of archetype's GY''' - The effects of "Bezel Ship", "Chronocorder", "Flyback", and "Perpetua" in particular are reliant on utilizing the GY's, so cards such as "[[Necrovalley]]" and the "[[Exosister]]" monsters which would either prevent or punish GY interaction can severely damage the Deck's performance.
  * '''"[[Dimensional Barrier]]"''' - This particular card proves a major problem by preventing the Deck from [[Xyz Summon|Xyz Summoning]] outright, therefore locking it out of both its ace and toolbox monsters.
  * '''Lack of negates''' - The archetype has no negates in its staple end board, making it weak to interruptions like "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]".

  === Sample combos ===
  "Time Thief" can work well as an engine for fellow Xyz archetypes, and vice versa. Its synergy with "Raidraptor" in particular can allow for easy Summoning of "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]" using "[[Rank-Up-Magic Soul Shave Force]]", in addition to their existing plays.

  Below is a sample combo with the following objectives:
  # Summon an untargetable "[[Time Thief Redoer]]" with a Trap attached to act as a scout for the opponent's Deck as well as "spin" removal.
  # Place "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" and "[[Time Thief Flyback]]" in the GY as forms of interruption to both [[banish]] an opponent's card and attach 1 card from the opponent's GY as material to a "Time Thief" Xyz Monster.
  # Summon "[[Time Thief Perpetua]]" to enable both "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" as an additional GY interruption and provide specific/plentiful materials to its fellow Xyz Monsters for their particular effects.
  # Use "[[Xyz Armor Fortress]]" to search "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]", which will make use of both monsters Summoned by "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" and subsequently allow "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]" to attach an opponent's monster to itself upon equipping one Xyz Monster to another.
  # Summon "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]" as an end piece and enabler for "[[Raidraptor - Strangle Lanius]]" to make an additional Xyz Monster.

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Time Thief Regulator]]"
  | end     = "[[Time Thief Redoer]]" and "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]" (both with "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" attached), "[[Time Thief Perpetua]]", "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]" and "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" in the Monster Zone + "[[Time Thief Flyback]]" and "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]" in the GY
  | steps   = 
  # Normal Summon "[[Time Thief Regulator]]" as your only monster, Tributing it afterward to Summon "[[Time Thief Winder]]" and "[[Time Thief Adjuster]]" (or "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" if "Adjuster" is in your hand).
  # Use "Winder's" effect to search "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]", and "Adjuster's" effect to send "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" from Deck to GY (if "Bezel Ship" is neither on the field to be used as [[Xyz Material]] nor already in your GY).
  # Overlay both monsters for "[[Raidraptor - Force Strix]]" and use its effect to detach one material to search "[[Raidraptor - Singing Lanius]]" (if using "Bezel Ship" as material, detach it for the preceding effect to enable the next step).
  # Revive "Bezel Ship" in GY by detaching "Force Strix's" remaining material, then Summon "Singing Lanius" from your hand.
  # Link Summon "[[Raidraptor - Wise Strix]]" using "Force Strix" and "Singing Lanius", then use its effect to Summon "[[Raider's Wing]]" from Deck.
  # Overlay "Bezel Ship" and "Raider's Wing" for a second "Force Strix", then use its effect to detach "Wing" and not only search "[[Raidraptor - Strangle Lanius]]" but activate "Wise Strix's" second effect to Set "[[Rank-Up-Magic Soul Shave Force]]" from Deck.
  # Activate "Soul Shave Force" to revive the first "Force Strix" from GY and overlay it into "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]", who will target "Wise Strix" to attach as material and free up the Extra Monster Zone.
  # Revive "Raider's Wing" in GY with its effect by detaching "Force Strix's" remaining material.
  # Overlay "Force Strix" into "[[Xyz Armor Fortress]]" in the Extra Monster Zone and use its effect to detach a material and search "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]" for you to Set. Afterwards, overlay "Fortress" into "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]".
  # Given you control the [[DARK]] monster "Raider's Wing", activate "Strangle Lanius'" effect in hand to Summon itself, then use its second effect to revive "Singing Lanius" in GY, and overlay both into "[[Time Thief Perpetua]]", whose effect you will use to attach a second "Power Reserve" from Deck to "Infinity" as material.
  # Pass turn, then during your opponent's Standby Phase activate "Power Reserve" to Summon itself from the Spell/Trap Zone and "Bezel Ship" (either from GY or a second copy from the Deck) and activate "Full-Armored Xyz" immediately after to overlay "Power Reserve" and "Raider's Wing" into "[[Time Thief Redoer]]" (doing so will make "Redoer" untargetable by card effects via "Raider's Wing's" effect).
  # Use "Redoer's" effect to attach the opponent's top card of Deck, then use "Perpetua's" to detach a material and revive "Adjuster" from GY, which will send "[[Time Thief Flyback]]" from the Deck to the GY.
  # After detaching "Power Reserve" from either "Redoer" or "Infinity", use "Perpetua" to attach "[[Time Thief Startup]]" to the other, enabling the GY effect of "Power Reserve".
  }}

  With the inclusion of "[[Silhouhatte Rabbit]]", the Deck is afforded an additional route to "Power Reserve" which allows them to conserve their "Winder" search for other options such as "Retrograde".

  Following Step 6 of the prior combo, this alternative route can be taken:

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Raidraptor - Wise Strix]]" in [[Extra Monster Zone]] + "[[Time Thief Winder]]" or "[[Sakitama]]" in hand
  | end = "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" [[Set]] in [[Spell & Trap Zone]]
  | steps =
  # Activate the effect of "[[Time Thief Winder|Winder]]" or "[[Sakitama]]", which will detach a material from an Xyz Monster to Summon itself and Normal Summon respectively.
  # Link the above Monster and "[[Raidraptor - Wise Strix]]" into "[[Silhouhatte Rabbit]]", who will Set "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" from Deck.
  # After using "[[Rank-Up-Magic Soul Shave Force]]" Set by "Wise Strix's" effect to Summon "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]", use said monster's effect to attach "Rabbit" and free up the Extra Monster Zone for other Xyz Monsters.
