  "'''Time Thief'''", known as "'''Chronodiver'''" (クロノダイバー ''Kuronodaibā'') in Japan and Korea, is an [[archetype]] of [[Level 4 Monster Cards|Level]]/[[Rank 4 Monster Cards|Rank 4]] [[DARK]] [[Psychic]]/[[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] introduced in ''[[Savage Strike]]'' as a [[TCG Exclusive]]. They also have connections to the "[[S-Force]]" archetype, as seen in "[[S-Force Showdown]]".

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#The Girl who Crossed Over Time}}

  == Design ==
  The Psychic members are scientists with clothing to match, wearing uniforms and glasses befitting of their time travel theme. The Machine members primarily take on the appearance of robotic animals doubling as time travel gadgets, bar "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" which as one can surmise is a ship.

  They appear to take inspiration{{citation needed}} from the science fiction series ''[[wikipedia:Doctor Who|Doctor Who]]'', the manhua/anime series ''[[wikipedia:Chronos Ruler|Chronos Ruler]]'', and the book series ''[[wikipedia:The Gideon Trilogy|Gideon Trilogy]]''. Most notably in the case of ''Chronos Ruler'', "Redoer" seems to bear heavy resemblance to series protagonist [[wikia:w:c:chronosruler:Victor Putin|Victor Putin]].

  ===Members===
  '''Humans (Main Deck)'''

  The human members of the archetype are past versions of their [[Xyz Monster]]s, each bearing effects to both get archetypal cards into rotation on Summon and Summon themselves from the hand respectively.

  '''Humans (Extra Deck)'''

  The human members in the [[Extra Deck]] are future/aged versions of the Main Deck humans, each bearing a [[Quick Effect]] to further the archetype's playing style and an effect during the [[Standby Phase]] that aid in said playing style's preparation respectively (with the exception of "[[Time Thief Double Barrel|Double Barrel]]" for the latter).

  '''Spells/Traps'''

  The Spells and Traps bear artwork chronicling "[[Time Thief Perpetua|Perpetua]]" as attempts on her life and research are thwarted by "[[Time Thief Winder|Winder]]" and "[[Time Thief Redoer|Redoer]]", eventually inspiring her to join their cause with the aid and tutelage of her future self (as seen in the artwork of "[[Time Thief Adjuster]]"). Most have a secondary effect, more often than not to banish themselves from GY in order to preserve the archetype's gameplan.

  == Playing style ==
  The archetype's main strategy is to swarm the board with [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 4 monsters and [[attach]] different [[card type]]s, including the opponent's cards. This is typically to the end of removing said opponent's cards before they can be exploited and providing specific materials to their ace monster, "[[Time Thief Redoer]]". Said "Redoer" can provide its own materials during the [[Standby Phase]] by attaching the top card of the opponent's [[Deck]] to itself, both potentially acquiring specific card types as material for its different effects and giving its owner information on the Deck their opponent is using. Afterwards, it can then detach up to three material types as a [[Quick Effect]] to banish itself until the [[End Phase]] to avoid attacks and disruptions (Monster), draw one card (Spell), or act as non-targeting removal by placing a face-up card of the opponent's on top of the Deck (Trap). For that reason, "[[The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine]]" is an excellent tech card for the archetype as it can be Summoned right away and used to make "Redoer" with its removal effect immediately online.

  Another Xyz Monster for the archetype vital to their setup is "[[Time Thief Perpetua]]". During the Standby Phase, it can detach one material to revive a "Time Thief" monster in GY. As a Quick Effect of her own, she provides any targeted Xyz Monster with a "Time Thief" card from Deck as material, making her vital to either keeping external end piece Xyz Monsters stocked up on material or specific material for the particular effects of "Time Thief's" own Xyz Monsters.

  Although not as immediately powerful, "[[Time Thief Double Barrel]]" can prove a useful secondary end piece for the Deck. When the opponent activates a card or effect, it can respond as a Quick Effect to detach up to three different material types much like "Redoer", albeit with different effects per type. These include granting itself 400 additional ATK (Monster), taking control of an opponent's monster until the End Phase (Spell), or negating the effects of an Effect Monster on the field without targeting (Trap).

  In terms of Main Deck monsters, easily the most important card for the archetype is "[[Time Thief Regulator]]". While it is the only monster on its owner's field, it can be Tributed to Special Summon two "Time Thief" monsters with different names from the Deck, simultaneously allowing their on-Summon effects to set up and allowing a Rank 4 monster to be Summoned immediately after. Should an Xyz Monster be destroyed by battle, it can revive itself from the GY to protect its owner or allow them to recover the following turn by providing material to Xyz Summon again.

  Among "Regulator's" typical targets to Summon is "[[Time Thief Winder]]", the Deck's de facto searcher. Upon Summon, it can search any "Time Thief" card barring itself. Even outside of "Regulator", it can be Summoned from the hand by detaching a material from an Xyz Monster, making it an extender as well. In such a case, one can reserve "Regulator's" Summons to other Main Deck "Time Thief" monsters and Summon "Winder" with its own effect once an Xyz Summon has been performed.

  A fellow Psychic monster imperative to setup is "[[Time Thief Adjuster]]", who on-Summon sends a "Time Thief" card from the Deck to the GY. This will usually include the Deck's Machine monsters which revive themselves from GY in order to extend the user's Rank 4 Summons. It can also act as an extender by Summoning itself from hand after another "Time Thief" monster is Summoned. The catch to this, however, is both its effects being "only one per turn, and only once that turn", so major discretion is required to secure routes to the Deck's setup monsters while working within this restriction.

  "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" Tributes itself as a Quick Effect to [[attach]] cards from the opponent's GY to your "Time Thief" Xyz Monsters (effectively acting as an archetypal "[[D.D. Crow]]"), making it an effective end piece that can be Summoned on the opponent's turn using "Perpetua's" Standby Phase Effect. It can also detach one material from an Xyz Monster during the user's turn to revive itself and, much like its fellow Machine monsters, extend Rank 4 Summons.

  In a similar vein, "[[Time Thief Chronocorder]]" can revive itself after an Xyz Monster leaves the field by card effect (i.e., "Redoer's" effect to detach a monster). As an emergency option, it can Tribute itself as a Quick Effect to have the opponent take the next Battle Damage they would inflict unto the user in place of them.

  The monster lineup is rounded out with "[[Time Thief Temporwhal]]", who like its fellow Machine monsters Summons itself from GY for Rank 4 extension by returning a differently-named "Time Thief" monster on field to the hand. Its Tribute effect targets and banishes an opponent's monster until the [[End Phase]], similar to the likes of "[[S:P Little Knight]]". However, given neither of the aforementioned effects are Quick Effects (thereby broadening its interaction potential), "Temporwhal" does not typically see play as "Bezel Ship" is a more easily exploitable tool for the Deck's gameplan.

  "[[Time Thief Startup]]" is a [[Quick-Play Spell]] that lets you immediately [[Summon]] a "Time Thief" monster from your hand, instantly triggering the effect of "Winder" or "Adjuster" without consuming a [[Normal Summon]]. It is also able to banish itself from the GY to supply your "Time Thief" Xyz Monsters with all 3 materials needed for their effects, making it highly valuable when playing the long game.

  "[[Time Thief Hack]]" is a [[Continuous Spell]] that protects the user's Xyz Monsters from being destroyed or targeted by opposing effects the turn they are Summoned, allowing the Deck's setup to flow with less fear of disruption. Its second effect targets an Xyz Monster to grant it 300 ATK for each of its materials, as well as allow it to attack directly should one of said materials be a card owned by the opponent. With 6 materials attached and the attack doubling effect of "Dugares the Timeless", "Time Thief Redoer" can use this effect of "Time Thief Hack" to attack directly for over 8000 damage.

  "[[Time Thief Flyback]]" is a [[Normal Trap]] that can be used to supply "Time Thief" Xyz Monsters with specific material from the hand or Deck much like "Perpetua". Its arguably stronger effect takes place in the GY, banishing itself to attach any card in the opponent's GY to archetypal Xyz Monsters as material, filling a similar role to "Bezel Ship" and effectively making it possible for the Deck to steal two of the opponent's cards from the GY as a Quick Effect (this particular effect being "[[Spell Speed 2]]") in a single turn. Hence, it is generally preferred to either send "Flyback" to the GY using "Adjuster or - more resourcefully - using "Perpetua" to attach it to an Xyz Monster for its own effect(s), placing it in the GY afterwards to enable its "steal" effect immediately.

  "[[Time Thief Retrograde]]" is a [[Counter Trap]] that can [[negate]] the activation of opposing Spells/Traps and, instead of destroying them, attaches them to "Time Thief" Xyz Monsters as material, thus making it a powerful option against cards that would benefit from being in the GY or to provide backrow cards as material for said Xyz Monsters' particular effects.

  The [[Continuous Trap]] "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" has great synergy with the card "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]", which when combined allows the Xyz Summon a Rank 4 during the opponent's turn with merely two Trap activations, especially a "Redoer" or "Double Barrel" with their respective spin and negation effects immediately online. Given the ease at which the archetype can make and synergize with Rank 4 Monsters and their associated archetypes, "[[Xyz Armor Fortress]]" slots perfectly into the Deck's combos in order to search "Full-Armored Xyz", especially upon a setup monster whose materials have been exhausted such as "[[Raidraptor - Force Strix]]", "[[Number 60: Dugares the Timeless]]", and "[[Ryzeal Duo Drive]]". This also opens up the opportunity for "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]" to be Summoned afterward upon "Fortress" as an additional end piece that can "steal" an opponent's monster with its monster attach effect. After being used and/or detached, "Power Reserve" provides another method of non-targeting removal via its GY effect by banishing a card on the field as a "[[Spell Speed 2]]" effect, provided the user's Xyz Monster(s) is supplied with a Spell and Trap as material. Aside from this, if "Perpetua" cannot otherwise, "Power Reserve" can allow for the Summon of "Bezel Ship" during the opponent's turn for said monster's "D.D. Crow-like" effect.


  The archetype has great synergy with the "[[Heraldic]]" archetype, which supports both Psychic and Machine Decks. As all members are of the DARK Attribute, they also benefit from generic DARK support as well as some Machine support like "[[Gear Gigant X]]". "[[Raidraptor]]" and "[[Phantom Knights]]" can also prove a boon for the deck, by searching/tutoring other Level 4 DARK monsters to extend Special Summons and/or setting up cards in the GY and backrow to do the same. "[[Raidraptor - Force Strix]]" in particular can search extender monsters like "[[Raidraptor - Singing Lanius|Singing Lanius]]", "[[Raidraptor - Strangle Lanius|Strangle Lanius]]", and "[[Raider's Wing]]" to allow for additional Level 4 monsters with which to Xyz Summon with, while "[[The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche|Rusty Bardiche]]" can send monsters like "Raider's Wing" to the GY in order to set "[[The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine|Shade Brigandine]]" for the same purpose. This is to say nothing of the potential allowed to Link Summon "[[Raidraptor - Wise Strix]]", whom can not only Summon an additional Level 4 monster from Deck but also set up "[[Rank-Up-Magic Soul Shave Force]]" to revive an expended "Force Strix" and promote it into a powerful omni-negate option in "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]", whom can subsequently attach "Wise Strix" to itself and free up the Extra Monster Zone for additional Xyz Monsters to take its place and enable the effect(s) of "Strangle Lanius" to Summon an additional DARK Rank 4 that turn.

  Generic Xyz Monster support can also work amazingly well with the Deck, such as "[[Overlay Regen]]" and "[[Xyz Reborn]]". This extends to other generic [[Rank 4 Monster Cards|Rank 4 monsters]] in general, including "[[Abyss Dweller]]" and "[[Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir]]" to limit the opponent's actions, "[[Tornado Dragon]]" for backrow removal, and "[[Number 60: Dugares the Timeless]]" to extend the user's plays. Given that "Bagooska" is immune to destructive and targeting effects whilst in [[Attack Position]], it can also act as a reliable route to "[[Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder]]" as a board wipe option, especially if the player's ability to set up normally becomes compromised. The Deck can also function reasonably well under the restriction of "[[Super Starslayer TY-PHON - Sky Crisis]]" on either side, as two of its monsters most often part of its end board in "Redoer" and "Cyber Dragon Infinity" fit below the 3000 ATK threshold, and can therefore punish high concentrations of opposing Extra Deck monsters by restricting their effect activations.

  A small [[Spirit monster]] package can be useful for enabling Rank 4 Summons, acting as an additional Normal Summon for the Deck besides "Regulator". "[[Aratama]]" can search "[[Sakitama]]" upon Normal Summon, the latter of which can Summon itself via its own effect immediately after.

  The archetype on its own may have issues with monster consistency, but thankfully in addition to the aforementioned "Raidraptor" synergy, "[[Small World]]" makes for a sufficient solution in addition to all of the Level 4 monsters they can run. "[[Sakitama]]" can act as a bridge between any Main Deck Level 4 "Time Thief"/"Raidraptor" monster '''OR''' "[[Effect Veiler]]"/"[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]" (sharing only a Level and Attribute respectively) and another "Time Thief" monster (sharing only a Level). The inclusion of such "handtrap" monsters like "Veiler" and "Ogre", as well as "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" (a fellow [[LIGHT]] monster to bridge to "Sakitama") for "Small World" purposes, can also be useful alongside "[[Crossout Designator]]", given the archetype's susceptibility to such cards.

  "[[Silhouhatte Rabbit]]" is a reliable route to "Power Reserve" that can be made with spare bodies on board after the important Xyz Monsters are in play, like "Wise Strix", "Raider's Wing", or "Sakitama". This way, one can reserve their "Winder" search for an additional disruption in "Retrograde".


  === Strengths ===
  * '''Concise and versatile [[Main Deck]] engine''' - The Main Deck monsters and their self-Summon/extension effects allow them to be splashed in a number of fellow Xyz Decks, aided by their one true required Normal Summon in "Regulator" which leaves greater room for other Xyz enablers that do not necessarily require a Normal Summon to go live.

  * '''Unconventional interaction''' - The "spin" and "GY steal" effects of cards such as "Redoer" and "Bezel Ship" provide a unique type of disruption, given few cards bear immunity to being returned to the Deck and the aforementioned "GY steal" effects target "Time Thief" monsters; not the card(s) in GY one intends to steal.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * '''Susceptibility to particular handtraps or staples''' - "Time Thief" monsters suffer a great weakness to cards such as the "[[Yo-kai Girl|Ghost Girls]]" (namely "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" and "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]"). A well-timed activation of such cards on the opponent's end can easily stop the effects of "Regulator" and "Redoer" in particular dead in their tracks, and the Deck's setup/strategy by proxy. 

  * '''Limited independent performance capacity''' - The Deck often requires use of supplementary archetypes and/or "free agent" cards to get the ball rolling when it comes to providing necessary monsters for setup. Hence why more often than not, "Time Thief" is found in joint builds alongside archetypes such as "[[Heraldic Beast]]", "[[Phantom Knights]]", "[[Onomat]]", and "[[Gunkan]]" to name a few.

  * '''Manipulation of archetype's GY''' - The effects of "Bezel Ship", "Chronocorder", "Flyback", and "Perpetua" in particular are reliant on utilizing the GY's, so cards such as "[[Necrovalley]]" and the "[[Exosister]]" monsters which would either prevent or punish GY interaction can severely damage the Deck's performance.

  * '''"[[Dimensional Barrier]]"''' - This particular card proves a major problem by preventing the Deck from [[Xyz Summon|Xyz Summoning]] outright, therefore locking it out of both its ace and toolbox monsters.


  === Sample combos ===
  "Time Thief" can work well as an engine for fellow Xyz archetypes, and vice versa. Its synergy with "Raidraptor" in particular can allow for easy Summoning of "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]" using "[[Rank-Up-Magic Soul Shave Force]]", in addition to their existing plays.

  Below is a sample combo with the following objectives:
  # Summon an untargetable "[[Time Thief Redoer]]" with a Trap attached to act as a scout for the opponent's Deck as well as "spin" removal.
  # Place "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" and "[[Time Thief Flyback]]" in the GY as forms of interruption to both [[banish]] an opponent's card and attach 1 card from the opponent's GY as material to a "Time Thief" Xyz Monster.
  # Summon "[[Time Thief Perpetua]]" to enable both "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" as an additional GY interruption and provide specific/plentiful materials to its fellow Xyz Monsters for their particular effects.
  # Use "[[Xyz Armor Fortress]]" to search "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]", which will make use of both monsters Summoned by "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" and subsequently allow "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]" to attach an opponent's monster to itself upon equipping one Xyz Monster to another.
  # Summon "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]" as an end piece and enabler for "[[Raidraptor - Strangle Lanius]]" to make an additional Xyz Monster.

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Time Thief Regulator]]"
  | end     = "[[Time Thief Redoer]]" and "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]" (both with "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" attached), "[[Time Thief Perpetua]]", "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]" and "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" in the Monster Zone + "[[Time Thief Flyback]]" and "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]" in the GY
  | steps   = 
  # Normal Summon "[[Time Thief Regulator]]" as your only monster, Tributing it afterward to Summon "[[Time Thief Winder]]" and "[[Time Thief Adjuster]]" (or "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" if "Adjuster" is in your hand).
  # Use "Winder's" effect to search "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]", and "Adjuster's" effect to send "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" from Deck to GY (if "Bezel Ship" is neither on the field to be used as [[Xyz Material]] nor already in your GY).
  # Overlay both monsters for "[[Raidraptor - Force Strix]]" and use its effect to detach one material to search "[[Raidraptor - Singing Lanius]]" (if using "Bezel Ship" as material, detach it for the preceding effect to enable the next step).
  # Revive "Bezel Ship" in GY by detaching "Force Strix's" remaining material, then Summon "Singing Lanius" from your hand.
  # Link Summon "[[Raidraptor - Wise Strix]]" using "Force Strix" and "Singing Lanius", then use its effect to Summon "[[Raider's Wing]]" from Deck.
  # Overlay "Bezel Ship" and "Raider's Wing" for a second "Force Strix", then use its effect to detach "Wing" and not only search "[[Raidraptor - Strangle Lanius]]" but activate "Wise Strix's" second effect to Set "[[Rank-Up-Magic Soul Shave Force]]" from Deck.
  # Activate "Soul Shave Force" to revive the first "Force Strix" from GY and overlay it into "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]", who will target "Wise Strix" to attach as material and free up the Extra Monster Zone.
  # Revive "Raider's Wing" in GY with its effect by detaching "Force Strix's" remaining material.
  # Overlay "Force Strix" into "[[Xyz Armor Fortress]]" in the Extra Monster Zone and use its effect to detach a material and search "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]" for you to Set. Afterwards, overlay "Fortress" into "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]".
  # Given you control the [[DARK]] monster "Raider's Wing", activate "Strangle Lanius'" effect in hand to Summon itself, then use its second effect to revive "Singing Lanius" in GY, and overlay both into "[[Time Thief Perpetua]]", whose effect you will use to attach a second "Power Reserve" from Deck to "Infinity" as material.
  # Pass turn, then during your opponent's Standby Phase activate "Power Reserve" to Summon itself from the Spell/Trap Zone and "Bezel Ship" (either from GY or a second copy from the Deck) and activate "Full-Armored Xyz" immediately after to overlay "Power Reserve" and "Raider's Wing" into "[[Time Thief Redoer]]" (doing so will make "Redoer" untargetable by card effects via "Raider's Wing's" effect).
  # Use "Redoer's" effect to attach the opponent's top card of Deck, then use "Perpetua's" to detach a material and revive "Adjuster" from GY, which will send "[[Time Thief Flyback]]" from the Deck to the GY.
  # After detaching "Power Reserve" from either "Redoer" or "Infinity", use "Perpetua" to attach "[[Time Thief Startup]]" to the other, enabling the GY effect of "Power Reserve".
  }}

  With the inclusion of "[[Silhouhatte Rabbit]]", the Deck is afforded an additional route to "Power Reserve" which allows them to conserve their "Winder" search for other options such as "Retrograde".

  Following Step 6 of the prior combo, this alternative route can be taken:

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Raidraptor - Wise Strix]]" in [[Extra Monster Zone]] + "[[Time Thief Winder]]" or "[[Sakitama]]" in hand
  | end = "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" [[Set]] in [[Spell & Trap Zone]]
  | steps =
  # Activate the effect of "[[Time Thief Winder|Winder]]" or "[[Sakitama]]", which will detach a material from an Xyz Monster to Summon itself and Normal Summon respectively.
  # Link the above Monster and "[[Raidraptor - Wise Strix]]" into "[[Silhouhatte Rabbit]]", who will Set "[[Time Thief Power Reserve]]" from Deck.
  # After using "[[Rank-Up-Magic Soul Shave Force]]" Set by "Wise Strix's" effect to Summon "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]", use said monster's effect to attach "Rabbit" and free up the Extra Monster Zone for other Xyz Monsters.
