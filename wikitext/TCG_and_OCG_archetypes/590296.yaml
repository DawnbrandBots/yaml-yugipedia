  "'''Time Thief'''", known in the ''[[OCG]]'' as "'''Chronodiver'''" (クロノダイバー ''Kuronodaibā''), is an [[archetype]] of [[Level 4 Monster Cards|Level]]/[[Rank 4 Monster Cards|Rank 4]] [[DARK]] [[Psychic]]/[[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] introduced in ''[[Savage Strike]]'' as a [[TCG Exclusive]]. They also have connections to the "[[S-Force]]" archetype, as seen in "[[S-Force Showdown]]".

  ==Design==
  The Psychic members are scientists with clothing to match, wearing uniforms and glasses befitting of their time travel theme. The Machine members primarily take on the appearance of robotic animals doubling as time travel gadgets, bar "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" which as one can surmise is a ship.

  They appear to take inspiration from ''[[wikipedia:Doctor Who|Doctor Who]]'' and the ''[[wikipedia:The Gideon Trilogy|Gideon Trilogy]]'' book series.

  ==Playing Style==
  Their main strategy is to swarm the board with [[Level]] 4 monsters and [[attach]] different [[card type]]s, including the opponent's cards, to their ace monster, the [[Rank]] 4 [[Xyz Monster]] "[[Time Thief Redoer]]". The Machine members tend to [[Tribute]] themselves to aid with this. To accomplish this, "[[Time Thief Winder]]" is able to [[add]] "Time Thief" cards from the [[Deck]] to your [[hand]], making it a valuable asset. This can be done by [[Normal Summon]]ing it, or by [[Special Summon]]ing it via detaching [[material]] from an Xyz Monster you control. Alternatively, you could use the effect of "[[Time Thief Regulator]]" to Tribute itself (while controlling no other monsters) to immediately Special Summon "Winder" and another "Time Thief" from the Deck. "Regulator" can also revive itself from the [[GY]] if an Xyz Monster you control is [[destroyed by battle]], though be careful as it will [[banish]] itself when it [[leaves the field]] after doing so. "[[Time Thief Chronocorder]]" will do the same though it can Tribute itself during your opponent's [[Battle Phase]] to make them take [[battle damage]] that turn if they continue to [[attack]]. 
  "[[Time Thief Bezel Ship]]" Tributes itself to [[attach]] cards from the opponent's GY to your "Time Thief" Xyz Monsters (effectively acting as a tribal "[[D.D. Crow]]"), but can also [[detach]] those materials to bring itself back to the [[field]]. Said Xyz Monsters are "[[Time Thief Perpetua]]" and "Redoer"; "Perpetua" can Special Summon "Time Thief" Monsters from your GY during your [[Standby Phase]]s, as well as [[target]] another Xyz Monster of yours and attach 1 "Time Thief" card from your Deck to it. This makes her perfectly capable of supplying "Redoer" with the needed materials for his own effects (and other powerful Xyz Monsters, for that matter), as he is able to detach up to 3 different kinds of materials from himself to activate the corresponding effects: detaching a monster banishes "Redoer" until the [[End Phase]], a [[Spell]] will let you [[draw]] 1 card, and a [[Trap]] will place a [[face-up]] Card the opponent controls on the top of their Deck. Given this is a [[Quick Effect]], this allows "Redoer" to become tricky to deal with on top of him being able to snatch cards from the top of your opponent's Deck each Standby Phase.

  "[[Time Thief Startup]]" is a [[Quick-Play Spell]] that lets you immediately [[Summon]] a "Time Thief" monster from your hand, instantly triggering the effect of "Winder" or setting up "Regulator"; it is also able to banish itself from the GY to supply your "Time Thief" Xyz Monsters with all 3 materials needed for their effects, making it highly valuable. "[[Time Thief Hack]]" is a [[Continuous Spell]] that protects your Xyz Monsters from being destroyed or targeted by opposing effects the turn they are Summoned, on top of letting you boost your monster's [[ATK]] by 300 for each material it has, but also lets them attack directly if at least 1 of their materials belongs to the opponent. "[[Time Thief Flyback]]" is a [[Normal Trap]] that can be used to supply your "Time Thief" Xyz Monsters with material from the hand or Deck, and can banish itself after this to attach any card in your opponent's GY to your monsters as material (similar to the aforementioned "Bezel Ship"). "[[Time Thief Retrograde]]" is a [[Counter Trap]] that can [[negate]] the activation of opposing Spells/Traps and, instead of destroying them, turns them into material for monsters, thus making it a powerful option against cards that would benefit from being in the GY.

  The archetype has great synergy with the "[[Heraldic]]" archetype, which supports both Psychic and Machine Decks. As all members are of the DARK Attribute, they also benefit from generic DARK support as well as some Machine support like "[[Gear Gigant X]]". "[[Raidraptor]]" and "[[Phantom Knights]]" can also prove a boon for the deck, by searching/tutoring other Level 4 DARK monsters to extend Special Summons and/or setting up cards in the GY and backrow to do the same. "[[Raidraptor - Force Strix]]" in particular can search extender monsters like "[[Raidraptor - Singing Lanius|Singing Lanius]]", "[[Raidraptor - Strangle Lanius|Strangle Lanius]]", and "[[Raider's Wing]]" to allow for additional Level 4 monsters with which to Xyz Summon with, while "[[The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche|Rusty Bardiche]]" can send monsters like "Raider's Wing" to the GY in order to set "[[The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine|Shade Brigandine]]" for the same purpose.

  Generic Xyz Monster support can also work amazingly well with the Deck, such as "[[Overlay Regen]]" and "[[Xyz Reborn]]". This extends to other generic [[Rank 4 Monster Cards|Rank 4 monsters]] in general, including "[[Abyss Dweller]]" and "[[Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir]]" to limit the opponent's actions, "[[Tornado Dragon]]" for backrow removal, and "[[Number 60: Dugares the Timeless]]" to extend the user's plays.

  ==Weaknesses==
  As effective as the "Time Thief" monsters can be in providing out-of-the-box interactions with the opponent, they suffer a great weakness to cards such as the "[[Yo-kai Girl|Ghost Girls]]" (namely "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" and "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]"). A well-timed activation of such cards on the opponent's end can easily stop the effects of "Regulator" and "Redoer" in particular dead in their tracks, and the Deck's setup/strategy by proxy. The card "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" can also prove a major problem for them by preventing them from [[Xyz Summon|Xyz Summoning]] outright, therefore locking them out of both their ace and toolbox monsters.

  Furthermore, the Deck often requires use of supplementary archetypes and/or "free agent" cards to get the ball rolling when it comes to providing necessary monsters for setup. Hence why more often than not, "Time Thief" is found in joint builds alongside archetypes such as "[[Heraldic Beast]]", "[[Phantom Knights]]", "[[Onomat]]", and "[[Gunkan]]".
