  "'''Floowandereeze'''" (ふわんだりぃず ''Fuwandaryizu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[WIND]]/[[WATER]] [[Winged Beast]] monsters introduced in ''[[Burst of Destiny]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines#No. 06: Floowandereeze}}

  == Etymology ==
  The Japanese name is a blend of three words, ふわふわ (''fuwafuwa'', "soft" or "fluffy"), ワンダー (''wandā'' "wander") and ブリーズ (''burīzu'' "breeze") (see the concept art below). The English name likely substitutes ふわふわ with the word ''flew''.

  == Design ==
  <div style="float:right">[[File:Floowandereeze-ConceptArt.png|thumb|250px|"Floowandereeze" concept art]]</div>
  These cards all show in their artwork the titular three "Floowandereeze" birds, which are based on the [[wikipedia:Arctic tern|Arctic tern]], traveling to various locations (as seen in the artwork of "[[Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map|Magnificent Map]]" and other [[Spell]]s/[[Trap]]s) to meet a different type of bird. The travel of the "Floowandereeze" birds and the locations they visit (Europe, the Americas, and Africa) is based on the Arctic tern's long North-South migration route from the Arctic to the Antarctic.
  The [[Level]] 10 "Floowandereeze" monsters are both based on birds from polar regions, while the Level 1 "Floowandereeze" monsters are based on birds in non-polar regions.

  == Playing style ==
  The archetype is centered around [[Normal Summon]]ing many times per turn and gaining advantage out of those Normal Summons. The main gameplan is to get out floodgates by Tribute Summoning its Level 10 boss monsters, "[[Floowandereeze & Empen]]" (which prevents [[Attack Position]] monsters from activating effects) and "[[Floowandereeze & Snowl]]" (which can [[flip]] all of the opponent's Special Summoned as a Quick Effect).

  Each of the [[Level]] 1 monsters shares the following effects:
  * A two-part [[Trigger Effect]]: The first part provides some form of advantage, the second allows another Normal Summon of a [[Winged Beast]] monster. This prevents the player from Special Summoning.
  * If this face-up card would leave the field, it is banished instead.
  * If you Normal Summon a Winged Beast monster while this card is banished: you can add this card from hand.

  {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center"
  ! Level 1 "Floowandereeze"
  ! Trigger Effect (1st Part)
  |-
  | [[Floowandereeze & Eglen|Eglen]]
  | Add 1 Level 7 or higher Winged Beast monster from your Deck to your hand.
  |-
  | [[Floowandereeze & Robina|Robina]]
  | Add 1 Level 4 or lower Winged Beast monster from your Deck to your hand.
  |-
  | [[Floowandereeze & Stri|Stri]]
  | Target 1 card in either GY; banish it.
  |-
  | [[Floowandereeze & Toccan|Toccan]]
  | Target 1 of your banished "Floowandereeze" cards; add it to your hand.
  |}

  The key starter card for the deck is "Robina", who provides a 1 card combo: "Robina" can search out and Normal Summon "Eglen", who can then search out a Level 7 or higher Winged Beast monster, such as one of the "Floowandereeze" boss monsters, and [[Tribute Summon]] it.

  The archetype's [[Spell]]/[[Trap]] [[support]] reaffirms its Normal Summon-centered strategy and rounds out the strategy with protection and consistency.
  * "[[Floowandereeze and the Magnificent Map]]" and "[[Floowandereeze and the Advent of Adventure]]" both provide [[search]] power and resistance against negates (via chain blocking and banishing the player's cards as cost to dodge targeted effects).
  * "[[Floowandereeze and the Unexplored Winds]]" provides [[Draw a card|draw]] power and card removal during Tribute Summoning.
  * "[[Floowandereeze and the Dreaming Town]]" enables the player to Normal Summon during the opponent's turn, allowing the player to rapidly expand their board, search for follow-up, and disrupt the opponent.
  * "[[Floowandereeze and the Scary Sea]]", the theme's [[Counter Trap]], is an additional piece of floodgate that [[negate]]s an opponent's Special Summon, locks them from Special Summoning for the rest of that turn, but in exchange allows them to Normal Summon 3 times during that turn.

  Because the player is usually prevented from Special Summoning (and thus has little use for an [[Extra Deck]]), it benefits from generic cads like "[[Pot of Duality]]", "[[Pot of Prosperity]]", "[[Dogmatika Punishment]]", "[[The Monarchs Stormforth]]", "[[Tribute Burial]]", and floodgates, whose costs are of little issue. Additionally, the archetype's focus on banish and recursion allows mass banishing floodgates like "[[Dimension Shifter]]" to be freely used in the Deck.

  Externally, "Robina" and "Eglen" can search for a variety of other Winged Beast monsters and Normal Summon them. Robina can get out "[[Barrier Statue of the Stormwinds]]" to floodgate the opponent (banned in the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'') or search for "[[D.D. Crow]]". "Eglen" can search for "[[Mist Valley Apex Avian]]", "[[Raiza the Mega Monarch]]", "[[Simorgh, Lord of the Storm]]", "[[Dark Simorgh]]", and "[[Simorgh of Darkness]]", providing a diverse array of boss monster options.

  === Not recommended ===
  * "[[The Monarchs Erupt]]" might seem attractive in the first place, but it locks out all of your level 1 "Floowandereeze" monsters.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As the archetype is heavily reliant on banishing their own cards, cards that prevent banishing, such as "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" or "[[Chaos Hunter]]" can shut down most of the deck's recursion plays.
  * As the archetype is dependent on requiring Winged Beast monsters on the field to activate their effects, cards that change the [[Type]] of monsters can slow down the deck. In particular, "[[Zombie World]]" also prevents any of the deck's Tribute Summons entirely.
