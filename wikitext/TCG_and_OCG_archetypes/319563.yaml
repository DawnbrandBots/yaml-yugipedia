  "'''Pendulum Dragon'''" (ペンデュラム・ドラゴン ''Pendyuramu Doragon'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yuya Sakaki]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Pendulum (archetype)|Pendulum]]" archetype. All members of this archetype are [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] monsters, except for the [[EARTH]] "[[Beast-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]]" and the [[Spellcaster]] "[[Double Iris Magician]]".

  ! [[Card type]] !! Monster

  == Playing style ==
  The "Pendulum Dragon" archetype does not have a common playstyle shared by its members; instead the Main Deck members benefit from the many support cards from the "[[Odd-Eyes]]"/"[[Magician]]" playstyles which in turn, the "Pendulum Dragon" members also support. The three "Pendulum Dragon" Fusion Monsters are best used with "[[Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]]" (since it is a compatible material for all of them) alongside a specific type of monster ([[Spellcaster]] for "[[Rune-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]]", [[Warrior]] for "[[Brave-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]]" and [[Beast]] for "[[Beast-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]]". 

  === With "Fusion Dragon", "Synchro Dragon" and "Xyz Dragon" ===
  The play style offered by using the "[[Fusion Dragon]]", "[[Synchro Dragon]]", "[[Xyz Dragon]]" and "Pendulum Dragon" archetypes together is desgined to interact with the various [[Supreme King]] cards which support "[[Supreme King Z-ARC]]". Both "[[Astrograph Sorcerer]]" and "[[Chronograph Sorcerer]]" can banish monsters of the four archetypes to Summon "Supreme King Z-ARC". In contrast, "[[Soul of the Supreme King]]" is the complete reverse of this, which can Special Summon "Z-ARC" without using any materials (though its effects are negated) but it can banish "Z-ARC" to Special Summon monsters from the four archetypes. "[[Supreme King Gate Magician]]" can Special Summon itself from the hand by sending one monster of the four archetypes to proc its on-Special Summon effect to add of "Supreme King Z-ARC"'s support cards.
