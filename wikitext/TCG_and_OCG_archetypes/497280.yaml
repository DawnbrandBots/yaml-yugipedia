  "'''Bonding'''" (ボンディング ''Bondingu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card|Trap Cards]] used by [[Bastion Misawa]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. It works in tandem with the unofficial "Chemical" series, which consists of a small number of cards named after and formed from things like elements and minerals, like hydrogen.

  == Playing style ==
  At the time of the archetype's initial release, the strategy relied upon getting 2 copies of "[[Hydrogeddon]]" and 1 copy of "[[Oxygeddon]]" onto the Field and then using "[[Bonding - H2O]]" to play "[[Water Dragon]]."

  The greatest strength of "Water Dragon" is removing the ATK of all Pyro-Type or FIRE Attribute monsters. One strategy is to use "[[DNA Surgery]]" or "[[DNA Transplant]]" to apply the effect to your opponent's monsters on a broad scale, with [[Tyrant's Temper]] protecting your own monsters. Another is to use monsters such as "[[Volcanic Queen]]" and "[[Lava Golem]]" to set up targets for "Water Dragon". The other effect of "Water Dragon" Special Summons its materials from the Graveyard when it's destroyed, facilitating its re-Summon if you can reuse "Bonding - H2O" with "[[Magical Stone Excavation]]" or "[[Recycle]]", or setting the stage for an Xyz or Link Summon.

  "[[Carboneddon]]" is a related card but has little synergy with the rest of the archetype; it can benefit from using "DNA Transplant" as it gains 1,000 ATK when battling a FIRE monster, but its main usage is banishing itself to Special Summon a Level 7 or lower Normal Dragon from the Deck, such as "[[Hyozanryu]]". This primarily lends itself to Synchro Summoning by playing a Tuner such as "[[Labradorite Dragon]]" or Xyz Summoning by easily summoning a high-Level material from your Deck. 

  In 2017, the release of "[[Duoterion]]", "[[Bonding - D2O]]", "[[Bonding - DHO]]", and the new ace "[[Water Dragon Cluster]]" made the archetype far more viable, streamlining searching and Summoning effects while giving an overwhelming boss monster. A solid strategy is to remove your opponent's back row with cards such as "[[Lightning Storm]]" or "[[Harpie's Feather Duster]]" before summoning "Water Dragon Cluster" to de-power your opponent's monsters, then split it into 2 copies of "Water Dragon" in the middle of the Battle Phase to overwhelm the opponent. You can go further with cards such as "[[Destruct Potion]]" to destroy Water Dragon and swarm its materials from the Graveyard.

  As the materials for "Water Dragon" are Dinosaurs, search cards such as "[[Babycerasaurus]]", "[[Fossil Dig]]", and "[[Petiteranodon]]" are a must, while "[[Jurassic World]]" facilitates the effect of "Hydrogeddon" and turns "Oxygeddon" into a more solid beatstick. "[[Souleating Oviraptor]]" gives even more searching power and revive effects and "[[Miscellaneousaurus]]", while vulnerable to the effect of "Water Dragon", is useful in both the hand and the Graveyard. Due to this, "[[Ultimate Conductor Tyranno]]" is another option for a powerful boss monster.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Since one of the main difficulties of a "Bonding" deck is the setup needed to make the "Bonding" Spells/Traps work, destruction effects can prove extremely helpful against this deck. "[[Raigeki]]", "[[Dark Hole]]", "[[Interrupted Kaiju Slumber]]" or "[[Torrential Tribute]]" can destroy any progress the "Bonding" player built up and might end the duel then and there.
  * The deck needs to Special Summon most of the cards it plans to use. Therefore "[[Archlord Kristya]]", "[[Vanity's Fiend]]" or "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]" are able to halt the deck rather effectively.
  * By the same token, cards that negate summons are also effective against this deck; examples include "[[Solemn Warning]]", "[[Solemn Strike]]" or "[[Solemn Judgment]]".
  * Since "Bonding" works with the GY to some extent, cards like "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Banisher of the Light]]", "[[Banisher of the Radiance]]" or "[[Macro Cosmos]]" can cripple the deck, as they can simply banish crucial cards like "Hydrogeddon" or "Duoterion".
