  "'''Bonding'''" (ボンディング ''Bondingu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card|Trap Cards]] used by [[Bastion Misawa]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. It works in tandem with the unofficial "Chemical" series, which consists of a small number of cards named after and formed from things like elements and minerals, like hydrogen.

  == Playing style ==
  Each "Bonding" card, except "[[Magnet Bonding]]", tributes monsters to Summon "[[Water Dragon]]" or "[[Water Dragon Cluster]]".
  * At the time of the archetype's initial release, only "[[Bonding - H2O]]" existed, which tributed 2 copies of "[[Hydrogeddon]]" and 1 copy of "[[Oxygeddon]]" on field to Summon "[[Water Dragon]]", which reduced the ATK of FIRE or Pyro monsters to 0, and could float back to its original parts. The ATK drop could be taken advantage of by giving the opponent "[[Lava Golem]]" / "[[Volcanic Queen]]", but the strategy was too inconsistent (requiring 4 cards for "Water Dragon" alone) and niche to see serious play.

  * In 2017, "[[Duoterion]]", "[[Bonding - D2O]]", "[[Bonding - DHO]]", and the new ace "[[Water Dragon Cluster]]" were released. "Water Dragon Cluster" can neutralize any opposing monster on field on the turn its summoned, and "DHO" can summon it on the opponent's turn. It can also split itself into 2 "Water Dragons", allowing an [[OTK]] by itself. However, the strategy remained inconsistent, and the effect of "Cluster" can be negated.

  * "[[Light Water Dragon]]" can Summon 3 WATER/WIND Dinosaurs by itself, thus fulfilling the cost of any "Bonding" card, although this is still a 2-card combo.

  As the materials required for the "Bonding" cards are Dinosaurs, search cards such as "[[Babycerasaurus]]", "[[Fossil Dig]]", and "[[Petiteranodon]]" are a must, while "[[Jurassic World]]" facilitates the effect of "Hydrogeddon" and turns "Oxygeddon" into a more solid beatstick. "[[Souleating Oviraptor]]" gives even more searching power and revive effects and "[[Miscellaneousaurus]]", while a FIRE monster, is useful in both the hand and the Graveyard. Due to this, "[[Ultimate Conductor Tyranno]]" is another option for a powerful boss monster.

  "[[Magnet Bonding]]" is related to the "[[Magnet Warrior]]" archetype, and has little to do with the "Water Dragon" side of the archetype (although it can be searched by "Duoterion"). Similarly, "[[Carboneddon]]" is thematically related, but is generic Dinosaur support and not related to "Water Dragon".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The archetype is inconsistent, even for the time. Each "Bonding" card requires 4+ specific cards (counting itself) in a certain location. "[[Light Water Dragon]]" can get access to 3 materials, making it a 2-card combo, but that is not consistent for the modern game.
  ** In the past, board wipe cards like "[[Torrential Tribute]]" and "[[Dark Hole]]" hurt as the archetype would rely on setting up over multiple turns.
  * The "Bonding" cards and "Light Water Dragon" are vulnerable to disruption. The latter is a clear target for common handtraps like "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]", and the former loses major card advantage if negated by any means.
  * The deck needs to Special Summon most of the cards it plans to use. Therefore, cards like "[[Archlord Kristya]]" or "[[Vanity's Fiend]]" are able to halt the deck rather effectively.
  * Since "Bonding - DHO" relies on the GY to some extent, cards like "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Banisher of the Light]]", "[[Banisher of the Radiance]]" or "[[Macro Cosmos]]" can cripple the deck.
