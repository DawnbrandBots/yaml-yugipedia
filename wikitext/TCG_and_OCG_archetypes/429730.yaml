  "'''Earthbound'''" ({{Ruby|地|じ}}{{Ruby|縛|ばく}} ''Jibaku''), is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by the [[Dark Signers]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' and [[Sergey Volkov]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. The archetype contains two sub-archetypes,  "[[Earthbound Immortal]]" and "[[Earthbound Servant]]", and one sub-series, "Earthbound Prisoner".

  The "[[Earthbound Spirit]]" is not a member of the archetype, as its name does not contain「{{Ruby|地|じ}}{{Ruby|縛|ばく}}」.

  == Design ==
  The monsters are based on either figures depicted in the [[Nazca Lines]] (in the case of the "[[Earthbound Immortal]]s"), or simply mythological or abstract creatures. The vast majority of monsters have a jet black body with glowing patterns of a single color which varies from monster to monster.

  == Playing Style ==
  "Earthbound Immortals" are Level 10 DARK monsters with various Types; as they were individually used as the Main Deck boss monsters of various characters and lack any inherent way to Summon them more easily, trying to combine them into a single Deck can cause issues with consistency and bricking, especially if one does not make use of newer "Earthbound" support released alongside the Servants.

  The "Earthbound Servants", conversely, have various levels but share a Type ([[Fiend]]), and are meant to be played together in a single Deck that utilizes both [[Fusion Summon]]ing and [[Synchro Summon]]ing. Being focused on the Extra Deck means they largely avoid the aforementioned issues that the Immortals have.

  The "Earthbound Prisoner" sub-series provides general support for the other "Earthbound" cards, but mostly does so for the Servants' playstyle.

  == Trivia ==
  * Though "Earthbound Spirit" is not a member of the archetype,  two other cards associated with [[Yami Bakura]]'s occult deck are technically included, "[[Call of the Earthbound]]" and "[[Zoma the Earthbound Spirit]]".
