  "'''Necrovalley'''" (ネクロバレー ''Nekurobarē'') is an [[archetype]] which supports the [[Field Spell]] of the [[Necrovalley|same name]] and the related "[[Gravekeeper's]]" archetype.

  == Playing style ==
  {{Main|Gravekeeper's#Playing style}}

  The original "[[Necrovalley]]" is a [[floodgate]] that prevents players from moving cards out of either GY. The rest of the "Necrovalley" cards support the Field Spell, either increasing consistency, protecting a "Necrovalley" on field, or slowing the game down with an added floodgate.
