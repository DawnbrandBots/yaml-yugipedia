  "'''Necrovalley'''" (ネクロバレー ''Nekurobarē'') is an [[archetype]] based around the [[Field Spell]] of the same name and is best used with the "[[Gravekeeper's]]" archetype. They focus on controlling the [[field]] and limiting the options of your opponent by preventing them from using their [[Graveyard]] as a resource, [[banish]]ing cards in the Graveyard, denying [[Special Summon]]ing of non-"Gravekeeper's" [[Monster Card|monsters]], and [[negate|negating]] [[card effect|effects]] that [[activate]] on the field.
  "[[Necrovalley]]" was introduced in ''[[Pharaonic Guardian]]'', with "[[Hidden Temples of Necrovalley]]" and "[[Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley]]" being introduced in ''[[Legacy of the Valiant]]''. While "Necrovalley" works as a stand-alone Field Spell, "Hidden Temples" and "Imperial Tombs" require the player to [[control]] "Necrovalley" itself and at least 1 "Gravekeeper's" monster. The same set also introduced "[[Gravekeeper's Ambusher]]" as [[support]] for this archetype.
