  "'''Endymion'''" is an [[archetype]] that debuted in ''[[Structure Deck: Lord of the Magician]]'', with further support in ''[[Structure Deck R: Lord of Magician]]''.
  ==Etymology==
  They're named after ''[[wikipedia:Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]]'' from Greek mythology. "[[Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians]]" is based on ''[[wikipedia:Selene|Selene]]'', lover of ''Endymion''.
  ==Design==
  ===Pendulum Monsters===
  The four "Endymion" Pendulum Monsters introduced in ''[[Structure Deck: Order of the Spellcasters]]'' form the core of the "Endymion" archetype. Design-wise, they can be divided by their gender and in-story status:
  * Female "Endymion" Pendulum Monsters have Pendulum Scale of 2, while male "Endymion" Pendulum Monsters have [[Pendulum Scale]] of 8.
  * The aide "Endymion" Pendulum Monsters are level 3, while the royalty "Endymion" Pendulum Monsters are Level 7.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Endymion" archetype is an archetype focused on using [[Spell Counter]]s and [[Pendulum Monster]]s, taking advantage of the fact that Pendulum Monsters can be activated as [[Spell Card]]s in the [[Pendulum Zone]].
  The four key cards of the archetype are their four [[Pendulum Monster|Effect Pendulum Monsters]], "[[Servant of Endymion]]", "[[Magister of Endymion]]", "[[Reflection of Endymion]]", and "[[Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic]]", the latter of which is their boss monster. Each of these monsters have multiple Pendulum Effects and Monster Effects. These effects can be divided into four types across all of these four monsters:
  * Spell Counter-generating Continuous Pendulum Effect 
  * Monster-Summoning Ignition Pendulum Effect
  * On-field Monster Effect
  * Floating Monster Effect

  The general playstyle of the "Endymion" archetype involves accumulating Spell Counters by using Spell Cards (including activating Pendulum Monsters in the Pendulum Zone), using the Pendulum Effects of the "Endymion" monsters to Special Summon themselves and each other, and ending the board with at least an "Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic", who is a card negate, a high-protection boss monster, and a going-second board-breaker through his card destroying Pendulum Effect. Their individual monster effects can serve as additional pieces of disruption: "Reflection" can return an enemy card to the hand when Special Summoned, and "Magister" can Special Summon her directly from the Deck in the opponent's turn.
  "Endymion" monsters do not passively generate Spell Counters after they're summoned from the Pendulum Zone; "[[Magical Citadel of Endymion]]" and "[[Endymion's Lab]]" fill in this gap by being Spell Counter generating Field/Continuous Spells with additional situational effects. The Link Monster "[[Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians]]" provides an immediate boost of Spell Counters when Link Summoned, has good Link Points for Pendulum Summoning, and can provide play extension/disruption by summoning "Endymion" monsters from the hand/Graveyard as a Quick Effect. Lastly, "[[Spell Power Mastery]]" is the archetype's main search Spell, and also provides additional Spell Counters.
  As another archetype of Spell Counter-using [[Spellcaster]] Pendulum Monsters, the "[[Mythical Beast]]" archetype has excellent synergy with "Endymion". "Endymion" monsters can summon "Mythical Beast" monsters with their Pendulum Effects, including extra negates like "[[Mythical Beast Jackal King|Jackal King]]" and board breakers like "[[Mythical Beast Master Cerberus|Master Cerberus]]". Meanwhile, "Mythical Beast" monsters continuously produce Spell Counters when summoned as monsters, supplementing the Spell Counter needs of "Endymion". Their main support Spell, "[[Mythical Institution]]", is also a generic searcher for Spell Counter-using monsters, making it good support for "Endymion".
  The archetype also has synergy with the "[[Magician]]s", another Pendulum-focused [[Spellcaster]] archetype. "Endymion" also supports the generic Pendulum boss monster duo of "[[Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon]]" and "[[Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon]]", as the archetype contains Level 7 monsters.
