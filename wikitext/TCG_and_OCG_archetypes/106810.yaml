  "'''Endymion'''" (エンディミオン ''Endimion'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Structure Deck: Lord of Magician]]'', with further support in ''[[Structure Deck R: Lord of Magician]]''.

  == Etymology ==
  They're named after ''[[wikipedia:Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]]'' from Greek mythology. "[[Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians]]" is based on ''[[wikipedia:Selene|Selene]]'', lover of ''Endymion''.

  == Design ==
  === Pendulum Monsters ===
  The four "Endymion" Pendulum Monsters, introduced in ''[[Structure Deck: Order of the Spellcasters]]'', form the core of the modern "Endymion" archetype. Design-wise, they can be divided by their gender and in-story status:
  * Female one have [[Pendulum Scale]] of 2, while male ones have Pendulum Scale of 8.
  * The "aides" are [[Level]] 3, while the "royalty" are Level 7.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Endymion" archetype is an archetype focused on using [[Spell Counter]]s and [[Pendulum Monster]]s, taking advantage of the fact that Pendulum Monsters can be activated as [[Spell Card]]s in the [[Pendulum Zone]]. The four key cards of the archetype are their four own Pendulums: "[[Servant of Endymion]]", "[[Magister of Endymion]]", "[[Reflection of Endymion]]", and "[[Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic]]", the latter of which is their boss monster. Each of these monsters have multiple [[Pendulum Effect|Pendulum]]s and [[monster effect]]s, which can be divided into four kinds:
  * A [[Continuous-like Effect|Continuous-like]] Pendulum Effect that generates 1 Spell Counter each time a Spell Card is activated (except "Mighty Master")
  * A self-Summoning [[Ignition-like Effect|Ignition-like]] Pendulum Effect
  * One or two on-field monster effects
  * A monster effect on floating

  | Can attack directly while it has Spell Counters, and during the opponent's turn it can discard a card to place 1 on all of your cards that can have them

  | [[Magister of Endymion|Magister]]

  | Gains a Spell Counter each time it attacks, and during the opponent turn it can remove 3 from any of your cards to Summon a monster from the Deck that can have them
  |-
  | [[Reflection of Endymion|Reflection]]
  | Can remove 3 of its Spell Counters to Summon itself and a monster from the hand that can have them, and places 1 on each
  | Can bounce an opponent's card and one of yours that has Spell Counters when Summoned, and takes the Spell Counters of the latter
  | Searches an "Endymion" card when destroyed by battle while it had Spell Counters
  |-
  | [[Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic|Mighty Master of Magic]]
  | Can remove 6 Spell Counters from any of your cards to Summon itself, destroys cards up to the numbers of yours that have Spell Counters, and gains 1 for each card destroyed
  | Cannot be targeted or destroyed by card effects while it has Spell Counters, also can bounce one of your cards with Spell Counters to negate a Spell/Trap activation, destroys it, and takes the Spell Counters of the bounced card
  | Searches a Normal Spell when destroyed by battle while it had Spell Counters
  |}

  The general playstyle of the "Endymion" archetype involves accumulating Spell Counters by using Spell Cards (including activating Pendulum Monsters in the Pendulum Zone), using the Pendulum Effects of the "Endymion" monsters to Special Summon themselves and each other, and ending the board with at least an "Endymion, the Mighty Master of Magic", who is a card negate, a high-protection boss monster, and a going-second board-breaker through his card-destroying Pendulum Effect. Their individual monster effects can serve as additional pieces of disruption: "Reflection" can return an opponent's card on their field to the hand when Special Summoned, and "Magister" can Special Summon her directly from the Deck in the opponent's turn.

  "Endymion" monsters do not passively generate Spell Counters after they're summoned from the Pendulum Zone; "[[Magical Citadel of Endymion]]" and "[[Endymion's Lab]]" fill in this gap by being Spell Counter generating [[Field Spell Card|Field]]/[[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous]] Spells with additional situational effects. The Link Monster "[[Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians]]" provides an immediate boost of Spell Counters when Link Summoned, has good [[Link Arrow]]s for Pendulum Summoning, and can provide play extension/disruption by Speical Summoning "Endymion" monsters from the hand or Graveyard as a Quick Effect. Lastly, "[[Spell Power Mastery]]" is the archetype's main searcher, and also provides additional Spell Counters.

  As another archetype of Spell Counter-using [[Spellcaster]] Pendulum Monsters, the "[[Mythical Beast]]" archetype has excellent synergy with "Endymion". "Endymion" monsters can Summon "Mythical Beast" monsters with their Pendulum Effects, including extra disruptions (like "[[Mythical Beast Jackal King|Jackal King]]" and "[[Mythical Beast Garuda|Garuda]]") and board breakers like "[[Mythical Beast Master Cerberus|Master Cerberus]]". Meanwhile, "Mythical Beast" monsters continuously produce Spell Counters when Summoned as monsters, supplementing the Spell Counter needs of "Endymion". Their main support Spell, "[[Mythical Institution]]", is also a generic searcher and recovery tool for Spell Counter-using monsters, making it good support for "Endymion". Both archetypes' playstyles also benefit from "[[Magical Abductor]]", which can also gain Spell Counters to eventually search any Pendulum Monster (as its Pendulum Effect) or any Level 1 Spellcaster monster (as its monster effect) from the Deck.

  The archetype also has synergy with "[[Magician]]", another Pendulum-focused [[Spellcaster]] archetype. "Endymion" also supports the generic Pendulum boss monster duo of "[[Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon]]" and "[[Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon]]", as the archetype contains Level 7 monsters.
