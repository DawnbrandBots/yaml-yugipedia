  '''"PSY-Frame"''' ({{Ruby|ＰＳＹ|サイ}}フレーム ''Saifurēmu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Psychic]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] debuting in ''[[Booster SP: High-Speed Riders]]''. They are related to the "[[S-Force]]" archetype as stated in the lore of "[[PSY-Frame Driver]]" and seen in the artwork of "[[S-Force Specimen]]".

  == Design ==
  This archetype is somewhat like "[[Vylon]]", as they are similar in appearance, focus on [[Synchro Summon]], share the same [[Attribute]] of LIGHT, and are named after letters after the Greek alphabet. Their gameplay also appears similar to the "[[Genex]]" archetype, with multiple [[Effect Monster]]s supporting one key [[Normal Monster]] ("[[Genex Controller]]" and "PSY-Frame Driver").
  The archetype primarily consists of "PSY-Frame Driver"/"[[PSY-Frame Multi-Threader]]" and several "PSY-Framegear" monsters which are donned by "Driver" to form more powerful monsters (the [[Synchro Monster]]s and single [[Link Monster]]).

  |}

  == Playing style ==
  The core strategy of the archetype consists of a single basic move: using the "[[PSY-Framegear]]" members as [[hand trap]]s to disrupt the opponent's moves while [[Special Summon]]ing themselves alongside "PSY-Frame Driver", performing a Synchro Summon during the opponent's turn with "[[PSY-Frame Circuit]]" if possible; "Circuit" is also able to provide significant [[ATK]] boosts, allowing members to easily beat over a healthy amount of other monsters. The archetype also gains banish-centered additional effects with "[[PSY-Frame Overload]]" and the Synchro Monsters, "[[PSY-Framelord Omega]]" and "[[PSY-Framelord Zeta]]", allowing the player to manipulate their own banished cards while banishing the opponent's to further disrupt their moves. By banishing themselves along with the opponent's cards, the "PSY-Framelord" monsters can temporarily leave the field in order to pave the way for the "PSY-Framegear" to trigger their effects, so the hand trap effects of the "Gear" monsters together with these quick banishing effects can have a great impact on the opponent's strategy, countering many moves they could perform. "[[PSY-Framelord Lambda]]" can allow one to use the "Gear" monsters even while controlling a monster, making the archetype more powerful as they can then gather up more materials for Summons if need be. "Multi-Threader" is also highly recommended as it provides protection for the other "PSY-Frame" cards and treats itself as "Driver" in the hand and GY, as well as Special Summoning itself if another member of the archetype is Summoned for potential [[Xyz Summon]]s or more Synchro material.
  Being a Synchro and banish-centered Psychic archetype, "PSY-Frame" has great synergy with general Psychic support such as "[[Esper Girl]]", "[[Psychic Feel Zone]]", "[[Psychic Path]]", "[[Bright Future]]" and "[[Past Image]]", for example. One may also want to consider [[Trap]]s such as "[[Summon Limit]]" to further disrupt an opponent's plays, as well as "[[World Legacy Awakens]]" to quickly get out "PSY-Framelord Lambda" or other Link Monsters. "[[Mischief of the Yokai]]" might also be a worthy addition to more easily Summon a powerful monster like "[[Overmind Archfiend]]" or "[[Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  The archetype's dependence to "PSY-Frame Driver" makes it vulnerable to cards such as "[[Prohibition]]". Furthermore, the effect of the "PSY-Framegear" members require the player to control no monsters to be activated, so unless you use the self-banishing effects of the "PSY-Frame" Synchro Monsters during your opponent's turn or have "Lambda" present, you usually won't be able to trigger more than one "Gear" per turn. This also makes "PSY-Frame" a tricky archetype, because while they can disrupt the opponent's moves acting as hand traps, they are also dependent to the opponent's moves, meaning that if you don't have the right "Gear" in the right moment, you might not be able to trigger their effects. Since all the "PSY-Framegears" are hand traps, cards like "[[Mind Drain]]" and "[[Debunk]]" can stop the deck dead in its tracks. This archetype is also vulnerable to cards that can Special Summon monster(s) to your side of the field, such as "[[Black Garden]]", "[[Grinder Golem]]", etc., since your opponent can play normally while you control a monster and just leave that monster alone until they are prepared to counter the "PSY-Framegear" monster on your hand.
  This deck also tends to struggle against the "[[Kaiju]]" archetype, and vice-versa. As both decks require the opponent to be able to make plays to counter, each Deck will be forced to stall against the other.

  == Trivia ==
  * In their Japanese names, the names of the "PSY-Framegear" monsters includes a lowercase Greek letters to denote their name whereas the names of the "PSY-Framelord" members include uppercase Greek letters.
  * The "PSY-Frame" archetype as a whole seem to have a ''[[wikipedia:Kamen Rider Series|Kamen Rider]]'' reference, either to [[wikia:c:kamenrider:Category:Heisei Era Riders|Heisei Era Riders]] as a whole (who have different powers based on their different forms/gear, as well as the main monster being named "Driver", a name also used for [[wikia:c:kamenrider:Category:Transformation Gear|every transformation device used by Heisei Phase 2 Riders]]), or strictly to the show ''[[wikia:c:kamenrider:Kamen Rider 555|Kamen Rider 555]]'' (which also uses Greek letters in its themes).
