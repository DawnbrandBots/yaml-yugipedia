  "'''Vendread'''", known as "'''Vendead'''" (ヴェンデット ''Vendetto'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Zombie]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. It is one of the two [[World Premiere]] [[archetype]]s that debuted in ''[[Code of the Duelist]]'', the other being "[[F.A.]]".

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|Master Duel card storylines#Dark, Dead Vengeance}}

  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  The "Vendread" monsters resemble mutated creatures and zombies, common from several horror series, in particular the ''[[wikipedia:Resident Evil|Resident Evil]]'' franchise, as well as a few possible nods to the ''[[wikipedia:Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'' franchise and ''[[wikipedia:The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]''.

  ===Etymology===
  "Vendread" is a portmanteau of "vengeance" and "dread". The archetype's ''[[OCG]]'' name, "Vendead" (ヴェンデット ''Vendetto''), is a portmanteau of "vengeance" and "undead" (アンデット ''andetto''), which is the Japanese name of the [[Zombie]] [[Type]].

  ==Playing style==
  The "Vendread" archetype focuses on [[Ritual Summon]]ing. So far, all non-Ritual monsters in the archetype come with two effects, each of which can only be used once per turn: the first effect revolves around the [[Special Summon]] of the monster from your [[GY]] when a certain condition is met, but comes at the cost of the monster being [[banished]] when it [[leaves the field]]. The second effect grants a "Vendread" [[Ritual Monster]] that was Ritual Summoned using the "Vendread" non-Ritual monster ''on the field'' an effect that enables considerable field advantage. "[[Vendread Revenants]]" and "[[Vendread Houndhorde]]" give the Ritual Monster a [[Quick Effect]] that allows it to [[banish]] the opponent's cards, giving its owner several ways to respond to the opponent's plays.

  Their first [[Ritual Spell Card]], "[[Revendread Origin]]", is easily one of the most practical Ritual Spell Cards seen in recent times. It is can Ritual Summon the monster ''from the GY'', which makes discarding the archetype's Ritual Monsters to activate effects a viable strategy, and enables the Spell to act as a recovery option for the archetype's Ritual Monsters after they leave the field. In addition, the Ritual Spell allows the player to Tribute monsters whose total [[Level]]s ''may'' exceed the Level of the Ritual Monster that is to be Ritual Summoned, and enables banishing ''any'' [[Zombie]] type monsters from the GY should one lack the needed monsters on the field or hand. This in turn opens a lot of possible combinations with the "[[Shiranui]]" archetype, as well as "[[Zombie World]]". Given that "Revendread Origin" has a protection effect that specifically lists and applies to only "[[Revendread Slayer]]", this card can be searched by "[[Pre-Preparation of Rites]]" which gives the deck the speed which every Ritual Summon deck needs, something that sets it apart from every other archetype-generic Ritual Spell Card that came before it.

  "Revendread Slayer" can add a Ritual Spell from the Deck to the hand, while also sending a "Vendread" monster from the Deck to the GY, when it is sent to the GY after being Ritual Summoned. Since "Revendread Origin" can Ritual Summon "Slayer" back from the GY, it should be ideally used as material for [[Link Summon|Link]] and [[Synchro Summon]]s to get more resources before Ritual Summoning it again later. The same can be done with "[[Vendread Battlelord]]", but it adds a [[Ritual Monster]] instead of a Spell.

  The archetype's [[Link Monster]], "[[Avendread Savior]]", can retrieve "Vendread" cards from the GY. Its usual targets will be their Spell Cards, as they can be immediately used. Since "Savior" makes it easy to reuse Ritual Spells, the player doesn't have to rely on "Slayer" to get more copies of "Revendread Origins" from the Deck, and can instead add the archetype's second Ritual Spell, "[[Revendread Evolution]]". While it cannot be searched by "Pre-Preparation of Rites", "Evolution" can use up to 1 "Vendread" monster from the Deck for the Ritual Summon, at the cost of requiring total Levels that exactly equal the Ritual Monster's. By using "Revendread Slayer", the player can send "Vendread Battlelord" to the GY and add "Evolution", which can be instantly be activated to Ritual Summon the "Battlelord" from the GY by using a second one from the Deck.

  "Slayer" and "Battlelord" can send "[[Vendread Striges]]" or "[[Vendread Core]]" to the GY, since both of them can be Special Summoned with no difficulties. The Deck's initial plays using its monsters as material for other Summons can help them Link Summon "[[Vampire Sucker]]" and "[[Summon Sorceress]]" to get more advantage. The latter can be used to Special Summon a "Vendread" monster from the Deck, gathering more effects to the final Ritual Monsters.

  The last Ritual Monster is "[[Revendread Executor]]". It protects all the other cards on your side of the field from being targeted by the opponent's card effects. If "[[Vendread Core]]" is used on the field for its Ritual Summon, "Executor" will also become unable to be targeted. This also protects your Set Spell/Trap Cards from common cards such as "[[Twin Twisters]]" and "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]".

  Due to the sheer number of generic Zombie support released through the years, "Vendread" have access to a plethora of useful support cards to make up for the small number of their own cards, in particular the likes of "[[Uni-Zombie]]", "[[Shiranui Solitaire]]", "[[Mezuki]]", and "[[Shiranui Spectralsword Shade]]", which can fill the GY with Zombie monsters, Special Summon them back, and gain advantage from banishing cards.
