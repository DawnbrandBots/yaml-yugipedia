  "'''Nouvelles'''", spelled "'''Nouvellez'''" (ヌーベルズ ''Nūberuzu'') in Japanese, is an [[Archetype|archetype]] made up of mostly [[DARK]] [[Beast-Warrior]] and [[Warrior]] [[Ritual Monster]]s with 1850 DEF introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Wild Survivors]]''/''[[Wild Survivors]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  "Nouvelles" is named after [[wikipedia:Nouvelle cuisine|nouvelle cuisine]], a style of French cuisine characterized by delicate dishes that emphasize presentation.

  The archetype's Chinese name, 饿魔新飨, includes 饿魔, a pun on "恶魔" (''Èmó'' lit. "demon") using a homophonous character 饿 (''È'' lit. "hungry"). The name also includes 新飨 (lit. "new banquet"), a stylized translation of "nouvelle cuisine".

  === Members ===
  Each of the "Nouvelles" monsters (except the "[[Nouvelles Token]]") are based on both a demon (principally from the ''[[wikipedia:Ars Goetia|Ars Goetia]]'') and an aspect of French cuisine. Their utilization of [[Ritual Summon]]ing resembles typical depictions of summoning such demons through rituals and deals.
  Their names are a combination of the name of the demon each represent and the French name of the aspect of French cuisine. Each member has a varying number of star decoration(s) on their body, matching with their Level as well as the stars awarded by the ''[[wikipedia:Michelin Guide|Michelin Guide]]'' to chefs and dishes for their quality. Except for "[[Poissonniere de Nouvelles]]", all "Nouvelles" monsters have 1850 [[DEF]], the same as the related "[[Hungry Burger]]".

  The archetype's effects to [[Tribute]] [[Attack Position]] monsters to [[Special Summon]] their [[Ritual Monsters]] from hand or Deck resemble a multiple course meal, with the lower to higher [[Level]]s of the monsters ranging from appetizers to main courses.

  == Playing style ==
  "Nouvelles" is an archetype of [[Ritual Monster]]s centered around [[Tribute|Tributing]] [[Attack Position]] monsters. All "Nouvelles" monsters have effects that allow them to Tribute cards when targeted for an attack or a card effect to [[Special Summon]] a "Nouvelles" monster that is 1 or 2 Levels higher than that monster's Level. Each pair of monsters also share activation conditions with one another. For example: The [[Level]] 1 and 2 monsters, "[[Buerillabaisse de Nouvelles]]" and "[[Confiras de Nouvelles]]", share the effect that when they are targeted for an attack or effect, they can Tribute themselves and 1 Attack Position monster on either side of the field to Special Summon a new "Nouvelles" monster with 1 or 2 Levels higher than them from the [[hand]] or Deck. The Level 3 and 4 monsters, "[[Poeltis de Nouvelles]]" and "[[Foie Glasya de Nouvelles]]", share a similar effect, which can be activated when any monster is targeted, and they can also Tribute other "Nouvelles" monsters over themselves. Finally, the Level 5 "[[Balameuniere de Nouvelles]]" can Tribute just an opponent's Attack Position monster to Summon only a Level 6 monster while the Level 6 "[[Baelgrill de Nouvelles]]" can Tribute the opponent's Attack Position monsters to Special Summon "[[Hungry Burger]]" or "[[Angry Burger]]".

  The main goal of "Nouvelles" is to establish a quick chain of Special Summons in order to speed through making the higher Levels of Rituals in order to remove the opponent's field through powerful effects. Their monsters are also supported by the "[[Recipe]]" cards, an archetype that helps establish board presence and interrupt the opponent's plays.

  "[[Chef de Nouvelles]]" fills the role of a starter in the [[Pendulum Zone]], as the turn it is activated allows it to search any non-[[Pendulum Monster]] "Nouvelles" card. Upon an opponent's Special Summon, it can Summon itself from the Pendulum Zone to provide two means of interaction: one to target an on-field monster to increase its Level by up to three as a [[Quick Effect]], and another to respond to an opponent's Special Summon by banishing a "Recipe" Ritual Spell from hand, Deck, or GY to copy its activation effect.

  Besides "[[Diviner of the Herald]]" (whom can be easily slotted into the Deck as an engine alongside "[[Cyber Angel Benten]]" and "[[Preparation of Rites]]"), the main [[Normal Summon]]/alternate starter is "[[Poissonniere de Nouvelles]]". Upon Summon, it searches either a Level 1 Ritual Monster (i.e. "Buerillabaisse") or "[[Recipe]]" card from Deck. When Tributed for either the Summon or effect of the Ritual Monsters, it can place itself in the Pendulum Zone to set up its other effect to target a monster on field to reposition after Special Summoning itself. Given its Level of 1 and ability to search out "Buerillabaisse", it makes the perfect material for said monster. The ideal way to Summon "Poissoniere" is through "[[Concours de Cuisine (Culinary Confrontation)]]", which will Summon not only it but "[[Patissciel Couverture]]" to the opponent's field to act as Tribute fodder for the effects of the Ritual Monsters' effects to Summon their higher-leveled counterparts.

  "[[Balameuniere de Nouvelles]]" is the Deck's central end piece, as its conditional [[Quick Effect]] to target an opponent's monster to Tribute and Special Summon "[[Baelgrill de Nouvelles]]" is capable of utterly decimating entire boards with the proper timing, especially in response to the opponent's effects that would Summon other monsters or cards on field whose effects have yet to resolve (in short, a "[[Dark Ruler No More]]" for all the opponent's cards and subsequent one-sided "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]"). "Poeltis de Nouvelles" is the preferred method to Summon "Balameuniere" for the above example, as when it itself is Summoned it provides an additional draw, and its effect to Summon a fellow "Nouvelles" monster will activate if any monster is targeted for an effect or attack (unlike its lower-Leveled "Buerillabaisse" and "Confiras", whose effects activate if they themselves are targeted).

  "[[Nouvelles Recipe Book "Recettes de Nouvellez"]]" provides multiple roles for the Deck, including targeting a "Nouvelles" Ritual Monster upon its Summon to both search a non-[[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous Spell]] archetypal card and enable said monster's on-target effect to tutor its fellow monsters. Whilst one controls a "Nouvelles" Ritual Monster, it forces their opponent's monsters into Attack Position (essentially acting as an archetypal "[[Final Attack Orders]]"), more easily setting up the opponent's board as Tribute fodder for the Deck's disruption.

  "[[Chef's Special Recipe]]" is another important end piece as a [[Counter Trap]] that can act as an omni-negate while you control a "Nouvelles" Ritual Monster (and subsequent destruction if you control a monster Summoned by one of their monsters' effects). After use, it is possible to use "Baelgrill's" effect to Tribute an opponent's Attack Position monster to Summon "Hungry Burger" from hand or Deck, which will trigger "Special Recipe's" GY effect to banish itself and Tribute all of the opponent's monsters, effectively allowing for two [[Nibiru, the Primal Being|Nibiru]]-like effects in a single turn. The card is searchable with "At Table", "Poissoniere", and "Balameuniere". It is preferred to relegate searching this card for the end of one's turn when all the above pieces are already on board and utilized, as the "Recipe" Ritual Spells and their recursion are not once-per-turn and can potentially loop resources and bodies for additional advantage.

  "[[Foie Glasya de Nouvelles]]", meanwhile, is a good situational tech option within the Deck's theme due to its ability to target multiple cards in either [[GY]] to be shuffled into the Deck. This aids in either recycling the Deck's own key cards or removing the opponent's own from the GY before they can be exploited, similar to the likes of "[[D.D. Crow]]". In a pinch, it can also act as another route to "Balameuniere" or "Baelgrill", especially as its effect to Summon either triggers upon any monster becoming the target for an effect or attack, just as "Poeltis'".

  The tangentially-related Ritual Monster "[[Angry Burger]]" serves as both a searcher for "Nouvelles" monsters and an additional option for both "Baelgrill" and "[[Hamburger Recipe]]" to Summon whilst providing interaction of its own. On field, it forces all able opponent's monsters to attack itself, as well as provides a [[Quick Effect]] to Tribute an Attack Position monster on either field to Summon a "[[Hungry Burger]]" with 2000 ATK from hand or Deck.

  The effects of the Ritual Monsters which Summon each other can be proactively activated during one's own turn using the [[Pendulum Effect]]s of "[[Poissonniere de Nouvelles]]", [[Quick Effect]] of "Chef de Nouvelles", or the [[Graveyard]] effect of "[[Concours de Cuisine (Culinary Confrontation)]]". "[[Nouvelles Recipe Book "Recettes de Nouvellez"]]" and "[[Recette de Personnel (Staff Recipe)]]" can accomplish this same goal during your opponent's turn by targeting a "Nouvelles" monster to either search a non-[[Continuous Spell]] "Nouvelles" or "Recipe" card and increase the target's Level by 1, or Summon a "[[Nouvelles Token]]" copying its Level. Non-engine cards like "[[Enemy Controller]]", "[[Book of Moon]]", and "[[Final Bringer of the End Times]]" can also fill such a role.

  "[[Dyna Mondo]]" is an excellent, nigh-indispensible card for the Deck. Not only does it provide simultaneous removal of the opponent's cards on field and recycling of Ritual Monsters (especially when Summoned on the opponent's turn using "[[I:P Masquerena]]"), but it can also Tribute itself as a Quick Effect to target and revive a "Nouvelles" monster in GY (provided it was previously properly Ritual Summoned), an especially good asset as said monsters have on-Summon effects that can either aid in the generation of card advantage or disrupting the opponent's plays.

  "[[Nephthys, the Sacred Flame]]" makes for a good late-game cleaner for the Deck given the sheer number of Ritual Monsters it is able to swarm with and recur (namely "Baelgrill" and "Hungry Burger" following a successful disruption attempt). With three Ritual Monsters used as its [[Link Material]], it bears a titanic 4800 [[ATK]] with targeting, destruction, and battle protection, helping to mitigate the archetypal monsters' comparatively meager ATK.

  == Strengths ==
  * '''Ability to generate advantage''' - Numerous cards in the Deck can provide ample cards in hand and/or bodies on field to extend interaction or Extra Deck monsters with which to toolbox. "Buerillabaisse", "Poeltis", and "Balameuniere" are +1's on-Summon even during the opponent's turn. Meanwhile "At Table" can search a "Recipe" card upon activation,r return a Ritual Monster in hand to the Deck to draw one, and recycle both a "Recipe" Ritual Spell and another card in GY to draw another card.
  * '''Ease of recycling and resultant engine potential''' - Due to the recycling ability provided by cards such as "At Table", "Foie Glasya", and "Pre-Preparation of Rites", the Deck can afford running lower numbers of its archetypal monsters and opt for various engine and tech cards in their place. Popular among these is the de facto LIGHT Fairy Ritual package (including "[[Diviner of the Herald]]", "[[Cyber Angel Benten]]", "[[Eva]]", and/or "[[Herald of Orange Light]]") as well as "[[Dogmatika]]" to more easily play going second. This also leaves space for various handtrap monsters to be played, especially ones with significant Levels that can be used for Ritual fodder if they are otherwise unable to go live.
  * '''High Consistency''' - The Deck's search ability is aided by "[[Pre-Preparation of Rites]]", essentially a +1 for "Nouvelles" as it adds both potential searcher "Buerillabaisse" and the "Recette de Poisson (Fish Recipe)" that facilitates it. "[[Preparation of Rites]]", meanwhile, searches virtually all of the Deck's Ritual Monsters and the potential tech card "Cyber Angel Benten" as both examples fit within said Spell's Level 6 and below threshold.

  == Weaknesses ==
  * '''Prevention/punishment of searching''' - As Ritual Decks require numerous specific pieces to establish proper board presence, "Nouvelles" being no exception, cards such as "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" and "[[Thunder Dragon Colossus]]" can severely hamper the Deck's ability to set up.
  * '''Conscious circumvention of Deck's Attack Position gimmick''' - Opponents who are familiar with "Nouvelle's" mechanics and consciously Summon their monsters in Defense Position can easily sidestep the Deck's interaction. This is, however, a case-by-case scenario as numerous modern Decks to some degree rely upon Attack Position monsters - such as Normal or Link Summoning - to set up. Furthermore, "Recipe Book" can help alleviate this issue with its "Final Attack Orders-like" effect.
  * '''"[[Dimensional Barrier]]"''' - Virtually all of the Deck's local setup involves Summoning of Ritual Monsters, a category included by "Dimensional Barrier" for preventing the Summon and effects of for an entire turn.
  * '''Non-targeting [[Spell Speed 2]] effects''' - Such effects activated on the opponent's end can cause certain Ritual Monsters of the Deck's to miss timing, so one must commit to preventing or consciously playing around said effects to properly establish boards.
