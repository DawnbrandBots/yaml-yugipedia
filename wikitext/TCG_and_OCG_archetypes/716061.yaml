  "'''Nouvelles'''", spelled "'''Nouvellez'''" (ヌーベルズ ''Nūberuzu'') in Japanese, is an [[Archetype|archetype]] made up of mostly [[DARK]] [[Beast-Warrior]] and [[Warrior]] [[Ritual Monster]]s with 1850 DEF introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Wild Survivors]]''/''[[Wild Survivors]]''.

  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#No. 08: A Demonic Menu}}

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  "Nouvelles" is named after [[wikipedia:Nouvelle cuisine|nouvelle cuisine]], a style of French cuisine characterized by delicate dishes that emphasize presentation.

  === Members ===
  Each of the "Nouvelles" monsters (except the "[[Nouvelles Token]]") are based on both a demon (principally from the ''[[wikipedia:Ars Goetia|Ars Goetia]]'') and an aspect of French cuisine. Their utilization of [[Ritual Summon]]ing resembles typical depictions of summoning such demons through rituals and deals.
  Their names are a combination of the name of the demon each represent and the French name of the aspect of French cuisine. Each member has a varying number of star decoration(s) on their body, matching with their Level as well as the ''[[wikipedia:Michelin Star|Michelin Stars]]'' awarded to chefs and dishes for their quality. They all have 1850 [[DEF]], the same as the related "[[Hungry Burger]]".

  The archetype's effects to [[Tribute]] [[Attack Position]] monsters to [[Special Summon]] their [[Ritual Monsters]] from hand or Deck resemble a multiple course meal, with the lower to higher [[Level]]s of the monsters ranging from appetizers to main courses.

  == Playing style ==
  "Nouvelles" is an archetype of [[Ritual Monster]]s centered around [[Tribute|Tributing]] [[Attack Position]] monsters. All "Nouvelles" monsters have effects that allow them to Tribute cards when targeted for an attack or a card effect to [[Special Summon]] a "Nouvelles" monster that is 1 or 2 Levels higher than that monster's Level. Each pair of monsters also share activation conditions with one another. For example: The [[Level]] 1 and 2 monsters, "[[Buerillabaisse de Nouvelles]]" and "[[Confiras de Nouvelles]]", share the effect that when they are targeted for an attack or effect, they can Tribute themselves and 1 Attack Position monster on either side of the field to Special Summon a new "Nouvelles" monster with 1 or 2 Levels higher than them from the [[hand]] or Deck. The Level 3 and 4 monsters, "[[Poeltis de Nouvelles]]" and "[[Foie Glasya de Nouvelles]]", share a similar effect, which can be activated when any monster is targeted, and they can also Tribute other "Nouvelles" monsters over themselves. Finally, the Level 5 "[[Balameuniere de Nouvelles]]" can Tribute just an opponent's Attack Position monster to Summon only a Level 6 monster while the Level 6 "[[Baelgrill de Nouvelles]]" can Tribute the opponent's Attack Position monsters to Special Summon "[[Hungry Burger]]".

  The main goal of "Nouvelles" is to establish a quick chain of Special Summons in order to speed through making the higher Levels of Rituals in order to remove the opponent's field through powerful effects. Due to the ease at which the cards are able to be recurred, the theme is able to afford running lower numbers of their actual monsters and going for various engines and tech cards. "Nouvelles" monsters are also supported by the "[[Recipe]]" cards, an archetype that helps establish board presence and interrupt the opponent's plays.

  A major asset of the archetype is its ability to generate card advantage in both the hand and bodies on the field with which to [[Link Summon]] supplemental monsters. "Buerillabaisse de Nouvelles" is a standout example due to not only potentially excavating and adding on-theme cards but also being a target for both "[[Voici la Carte (Today's Menu)]]" and "[[Pre-Preparation of Rites]]", making it extremely easy to acquire both the Deck's go-to searcher and "[[Recette de Poisson (Fish Recipe)]]" (which can search a second "Recipe" [[Ritual Spell]] upon Summoning "Buerillabaisse") that facilitates it. "[[Nouvelles Restaurant "At Table"]]" is equally valuable, being a source of a lot of the Deck's draw power and recursion by recycling any card in GY alongside a "Recipe" to draw one as well as "de-bricking" hands by placing Ritual Monsters from them on the bottom of the Deck for the same effect.

  Besides "[[Diviner of the Herald]]" (whom can be easily slotted into the Deck as an engine alongside "[[Cyber Angel Benten]]" and "[[Preparation of Rites]]"), the main [[Normal Summon]]/starter is "[[Poissonniere de Nouvelles]]". Upon Summon, it searches either a Level 1 Ritual Monster (i.e. "Buerillabaisse") or "[[Recipe]]" card from Deck. When Tributed for either the Summon or effect of the Ritual Monsters, it can place itself in the Pendulum Zone to set up its other effect to target a monster on field to reposition after Special Summoning itself. Given its Level of 1 and ability to search out "Buerillabaisse", it makes the perfect material for said monster. The ideal way to Summon "Poissoniere" is through "[[Concours de Cuisine (Culinary Confrontation)]]", which will Summon not only it but "[[Patissciel Couverture]]" to the opponent's field to act as Tribute fodder for the effects of the Ritual Monsters' effects to Summon their higher-leveled counterparts.

  "[[Balameuniere de Nouvelles]]" is the Deck's central end piece, as its conditional [[Quick Effect]] to target an opponent's monster to Tribute and Special Summon "[[Baelgrill de Nouvelles]]" is capable of utterly decimating entire boards with the proper timing, especially in response to the opponent's effects that would Summon other monsters or cards on field whose effects have yet to resolve (in short, a "[[Dark Ruler No More]]" for all the opponent's cards and subsequent one-sided "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]"). "Poeltis de Nouvelles" is the preferred method to Summon "Balameuniere" for the above example, as when it itself is Summoned it provides an additional draw, and its effect to Summon a fellow "Nouvelles" monster will activate if any monster is targeted for an effect or attack (unlike its lower-Leveled "Buerillabaisse" and "Confiras", whose effects activate if they themselves are targeted).

  "[[Chef's Special Recipe]]" is another important end piece as a [[Counter Trap]] that can act as an omni-negate while you control a "Nouvelles" Ritual Monster (and subsequent destruction if you control a monster Summoned by one of their monsters' effects). After use, it is possible to use "Baelgrill's" effect to Tribute an opponent's Attack Position monster to Summon "Hungry Burger" from hand or Deck, which will trigger "Special Recipe's" GY effect to banish itself and Tribute all of the opponent's monsters, effectively allowing for two [[Nibiru, the Primal Being|Nibiru]]-like effects in a single turn. The card is searchable with "At Table", "Poissoniere", and "Balameuniere". It is preferred to relegate searching this card for the end of one's turn when all the above pieces are already on board and utilized, as the "Recipe" Ritual Spells and their recursion are not once-per-turn and can potentially loop resources and bodies for additional advantage.

  "[[Foie Glasya de Nouvelles]]", meanwhile, is a good situational tech option within the Deck's theme due to its ability to target multiple cards in either [[GY]] to be shuffled into the Deck. This aids in either recycling the Deck's own key cards or removing the opponent's own from the GY before they can be exploited, similar to the likes of "[[D.D. Crow]]". In a pinch, it can also act as another route to "Balameuniere" or "Baelgrill", especially as its effect to Summon either triggers upon any monster becoming the target for an effect or attack, just as "Poeltis'".

  The effects of the Ritual Monsters which Summon each other can be proactively activated during your turn using either the [[Pendulum Effect]] of "[[Poissonniere de Nouvelles]]" (which targets a monster to Special Summon itself and subsequently change the target's [[Battle Position]]), or the [[Graveyard]] effect of "[[Concours de Cuisine (Culinary Confrontation)]]" (which banishes itself to target an on-field monster to increase its [[ATK]] for each "[[Recipe]]" card in the GY's). "[[Recette de Personnel (Staff Recipe)]]" can accomplish this same goal during your opponent's turn by targeting a "[[Nouvelles]]" monster to Summon a "[[Nouvelles Token]]" copying its Level, as well as "[[Enemy Controller]]" and other such chainable targeting effects.

  "[[Dyna Mondo]]" is an excellent, nigh-indispensible card for the Deck. Not only does it provide simultaneous removal of the opponent's cards on field and recycling of Ritual Monsters (especially when Summoned on the opponent's turn using "[[I:P Masquerena]]"), but it can also Tribute itself as a Quick Effect to target and revive a "Nouvelles" monster in GY (provided it was previously properly Ritual Summoned), an especially good asset as said monsters have on-Summon effects that can either aid in the generation of card advantage or disrupting the opponent's plays.

  "[[Nephthys, the Sacred Flame]]" makes for a good late-game cleaner for the Deck given the sheer number of Ritual Monsters it is able to swarm with and recur (namely "Baelgrill" and "Hungry Burger" following a successful disruption attempt). With three Ritual Monsters used as its [[Link Material]], it bears a titanic 4800 [[ATK]] with targeting, destruction, and battle protection, helping to mitigate the archetypal monsters' comparatively meager ATK.

  == Weaknesses ==
  * As is the case the the majority of Decks that center around a single Summoning mechanic, "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" and other such cards that prevent [[Ritual Summon]]ing or [[Tribute|Tributing]] monsters outright can prevent "Nouvelles" from ever setting up their boards in the first place.
  * Cards that prevent searching such as "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" and "[[Thunder Dragon Colossus]]" prove a major problem as the archetype is extremely dependent on being able to retrieve its specific pieces from Deck to establish proper board presence, especially as a Ritual Deck.
  * An opponent who is familiar with "Nouvelles'" condition of Tributing [[Attack Position]] monsters and consciously Summons their monsters in [[Defense Position]] accordingly can easily circumvent the archetype's ability to remove monsters on field to tag in others from hand or Deck. This is, however, a case-by-case scenario and at least in some capacity the majority of Decks rely on at least one [[Normal Summon]] and/or [[Link Summon]]ing, which will provide at least one Attack Position monster and opportunity for this Deck's monsters to interact.
