  "'''Nouvelles'''" (ヌーベルズ ''Nūberuzu'') is an [[Archetype|archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Beast-Warrior]] and [[Warrior]] [[Ritual Monster]]s with 1850 DEF introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Wild Survivors]]''/''[[Wild Survivors]]''.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  "Nouvelles" is named after [[wikipedia:Nouvelle cuisine|nouvelle cuisine]], a style of French cuisine characterized by delicate dishes that emphasize presentation.

  ===Members===
  Each of the "Nouvelles" monsters (except the "[[Nouvelles Token]]") are based on both a demon (principally from the ''[[wikipedia:Ars Goetia|Ars Goetia]]'') and an aspect of French cuisine. Their utilization of [[Ritual Summon]]ing resembles typical depictions of summoning such demons through rituals and deals.
  Their names are a combination of the name of the demon each represent and the French name of the aspect of French cuisine. Each member has a varying number of star decoration(s) on their body, matching with their Level as well as the ''[[wikipedia:Michelin Star|Michelin Stars]]'' awarded to chefs and dishes for their quality. They all have 1850 [[DEF]], the same as the related "[[Hungry Burger]]".

  The archetype's effects to [[Tribute]] [[Attack Position]] monsters to [[Special Summon]] their [[Ritual Monsters]] from hand or Deck resemble a multiple course meal, with the lower to higher [[Level]]s of the monsters ranging from appetizers to main courses.

  ==Playing style==
  "Nouvelles" is an archetype of [[Ritual Monster]]s centered around [[Tribute|Tributing]] [[Attack Position]] monsters. All "Nouvelles" monsters have effects that allow them to Tribute cards when targeted for an attack or a card effect to [[Special Summon]] a "Nouvelles" monster that is 1 or 2 Levels higher than that monster's Level. Each pair of monsters also share activation conditions with one another. For example: The [[Level]] 1 and 2 monsters, "[[Buerillabaisse de Nouvelles]]" and "[[Confiras de Nouvelles]]", share the effect that when they are targeted for an attack or effect, they can Tribute themselves and 1 Attack Position monster on either side of the field to Special Summon a new "Nouvelles" monster with 1 or 2 Levels higher than them from the [[hand]] or Deck. The Level 3 and 4 monsters, "[[Poeltis de Nouvelles]]" and "[[Foie Glasya de Nouvelles]]", share a similar effect, which can be activated when any monster is targeted, and they can also Tribute other "Nouvelles" monsters over themselves. Finally, the Level 5 "[[Balameuniere de Nouvelles]]" can Tribute just an opponent's Attack Position monster to Summon only a Level 6 monster while the Level 6 "[[Baelgrill de Nouvelles]]" can Tribute the opponent's Attack Position monsters to Special Summon "[[Hungry Burger]]".

  The main goal of "Nouvelles" is to establish a quick chain of Special Summons in order to speed through making the higher Levels of Rituals in order to remove the opponent's field through powerful effects. Due to the ease at which the cards are able to be recurred, the theme is able to afford running lower numbers of their actual monsters and going for various engines and tech cards. "Nouvelles" monsters are also supported by the "[[Recipe]]" cards, an archetype that helps establish board presence and interrupt the opponent's plays.

  "Balameuniere de Nouvelles" is the Deck's central end piece, as its conditional [[Quick Effect]] to target an opponent's monster to Tribute and Special Summon "Baelgrill de Nouvelles" is capable of utterly decimating entire boards with the proper timing, especially in response to the opponent's effects that would Summon other monsters or cards on field whose effects have yet to resolve. "Poeltis de Nouvelles" is the preferred method to Summon "Balameuniere" for the above example, as when it itself is Summoned it provides an additional draw, and its effect to Summon a fellow "Nouvelles" monster will activate if any monster is targeted for an effect or attack (unlike its lower-Leveled "Buerillabaisse" and "Confiras", whose effects activate if they themselves are targeted).

  "Foie Glasya de Nouvelles", meanwhile, is a good situational tech option within the Deck's theme due to its ability to target multiple cards in either [[GY]] to be shuffled into the Deck. This aids in either recycling the Deck's own key cards or removing the opponent's own from the GY before they can be exploited, similar to the likes of "[[D.D. Crow]]".

  The effects of the Ritual Monsters which Summon each other can be proactively activated during your turn using either the [[Pendulum Effect]] of "[[Poissonniere de Nouvelles]]" (which targets a monster to Special Summon itself and subsequently change the target's [[Battle Position]]), or the [[Graveyard]] effect of "[[Concours de Cuisine (Culinary Confrontation)]]" (which banishes itself to target an on-field monster to increase its [[ATK]] for each "[[Recipe]]" card in the GY's). "[[Recette de Personnel (Staff Recipe)]]" can accomplish this same goal during your opponent's turn by targeting a "[[Nouvelles]]" monster to Summon a "[[Nouvelles Token]]" copying its Level, as well as "[[Enemy Controller]]" and other such chainable targeting effects.

  "[[Dyna Mondo]]" is an excellent, nigh-indispensible card for the Deck. Not only does it provide simultaneous removal of the opponent's cards on field and recycling of Ritual Monsters (especially when Summoned on the opponent's turn using "[[I:P Masquerena]]"), but it can also Tribute itself as a Quick Effect to target and revive a "Nouvelles" monster in GY (provided it was previously properly Ritual Summoned), an especially good asset as said monsters have on-Summon effects that can either aid in the generation of card advantage or disrupting the opponent's plays.
