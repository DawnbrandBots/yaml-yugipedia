  "'''Sea Stealth'''" (シー・ステルス ''Shī Suterusu'') is an [[archetype]] mainly consisting of [[Spell]]s/[[Trap]]s related to the [[Umi (series)|Umi]] [[series]]. It is based on the strategies used by [[Mako Tsunami]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|manga]]. Both its first member and its first supporting card, "[[Sea Stealth Attack]]" and "[[Ocean Dragon Lord - Kairyu-Shin]]", were first released in ''[[Duelist Pack]]'' set: ''[[Legendary Duelists]]''/''[[Duelist Pack: Legend Duelist]]'' and ''[[Duelist Pack: Duelists of the Abyss]]'' respectively. However, "Sea Stealth Attack" was already supported by name by "[[Citadel Whale]]", which was first released in its same set.

  The [[Monster Card]] "[[Galaxy Stealth Dragon]]" is part of this archetype due to its Japanese name, but it is completely unrelated both technically and thematically. Also, its membership causes no problems, because "Ocean Dragon Lord - Kairyu-Shin" only supports Spells/Traps.
