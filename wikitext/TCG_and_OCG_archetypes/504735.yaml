  "'''Ultimate Crystal'''", known as "'''Ultimate Gem God'''" ({{Ruby|究|きゅう}}{{Ruby|極|きょく}}{{Ruby|宝|ほう}}{{Ruby|玉|ぎょく}}{{Ruby|神|しん}} ''Kyūkyoku Hōgyokushin'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Dragon]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Jesse Anderson]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime that [[support]]s the "[[Crystal Beast]]" archetype. This archetype is a sub-archetype of the "[[Crystal]]" archetype.

  In the ''TCG'', prior to the release of "[[Ultimate Crystal Rainbow Dragon Overdrive]]" in ''[[Structure Deck: Legend of the Crystal Beasts]]'', none of the members of this archetype had the archetype as part of their name, instead using [[archetype condition]]s to indicate membership. This is because for over ten years, this archetype's only two members were "[[Rainbow Dragon]]" and "[[Rainbow Dark Dragon]]", and all support for the archetype referenced those two specific cards by name. When "[[Rainbow Overdragon]]", the first new member of this archetype, was released in the ''TCG'', the original two members and "Overdragon" were given an [[archetype condition]] stating that they were always treated as "Ultimate Crystal" monsters. All support for the archetype subsequently received errata appropriately (except "[[Rainbow Path]]", but since it only affects "Ultimate Crystal" monsters in the Main Deck, and all newer "Ultimate Crystal" monsters are Extra Deck monsters, this does not make a difference).

  ==Playing style==
  {{See also|Crystal Beast#Playing style}}

  The "Ultimate Crystal" monsters serve as the boss monsters of the "[[Crystal Beast]]" decks, with the cumulative goal of their strategy is to fill the field and GY with "Crystal Beast" cards in order to Summon them. Alongside the many "[[Crystal]]" [[Spell Card|Spells]] and [[Trap Card|Traps]] that made filling the field and GY with "[[Crystal Beast]]" monsters more easily, another archetype closely supporting the "Crystal" archetype is "[[Rainbow Bridge (archetype)|Rainbow Bridge]]". "[[Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon]]" can Special Summon another "Crystal Beast" monster from the Deck while adding an "Ultimate Crystal" monster from the Deck by banishing itself as a Continuous Spell (placed there either with "[[Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus]]" or "[[Crystal Bond]]"). Having an "Ultimate Crystal" monster in the hand then enables the usage of "[[Awakening of the Crystal Ultimates]]" which can either search or mill a "Rainbow Bridge" card (if either "[[Rainbow Bridge]]" or "[[Rainbow Bridge of the Heart]]" is searched, their effects can then search a "Crystal" Spell/Trap) or Special Summon a "Crystal Beast" monster from anywhere (except for [[banish]]ed ones). This gave the Main Deck "Ultimate Crystal" monsters utility as an engine piece for enabling the effects of these two cards to be used.

  Between the current two Main Deck "Ultimate Crystal" monsters, the original "[[Rainbow Dragon]]" is far easier to Summon in a dedicated "Crystal Beast" deck while "[[Rainbow Dark Dragon]]" is more useful in any DARK-centric decks or with "[[Advanced Dark]]" in "Crystal Beast" decks. After the player Special Summons either "Rainbow Dragon" or "Rainbow Dark Dragon", they can then Special Summon "[[Rainbow Overdragon]]" by tributing that Level 10 "Ultimate Crystal" monster, then finally Summoning "[[Ultimate Crystal Rainbow Dragon Overdrive]]" by banishing the Level 10 "Ultimate Crystal" monster and the "Crystal Beast" monsters. With two high ATK beatsticks, the two "Ultimate Crystal" [[Fusion Monster]]s serve as the deck's OTK enablers while "Overdrive's" effect of clearing the entire field and Special Summon a horde of "Crystal Beast" monsters at anytime makes it a powerful boardbreaker and a piece of disruption.
