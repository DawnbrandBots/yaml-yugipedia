  "'''HERO'''" ({{Ruby|ＨＥＲＯ|ヒーロー}} ''Hīrō'') is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[Warrior]] monsters introduced in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' that includes five sub-archetypes as well as several other cards. "HERO" monsters are often based on comic, cartoon, or cinematic superheroes.
  This archetype was used by [[Jaden Yuki]], [[Aster Phoenix]], and [[The Supreme King]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, and an alternate version of [[Aster Phoenix (ARC-V)|Aster Phoenix]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. It was also used by [[Jaden Yuki (manga)|Jaden Yuki]], [[Aster Phoenix (manga)|Aster Phoenix]], and [[Koyo Hibiki]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (manga)|''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' manga]], and [[Fusion Mask]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL]]'' manga.

  The "HERO" archetype is the second largest archetype in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' franchise, behind "[[Number]]".

  == Sub-themes ==
  The "HERO" archetype exists to unify various related themes that primarily appear in the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' anime and manga. The primary themes that comprise the "HERO" archetype are "[[Elemental HERO]]", "[[Evil HERO]]", "[[Destiny HERO]]", "[[Masked HERO]]" and "[[Vision HERO]]". There are several monsters that are not part of any of these five themes by name: "[[Contrast HERO Chaos]]" (although it is treated as an "Elemental HERO" card), the [[Xtra HERO]] cards, and the [[Illegal]] [[Match winner]] "[[E☆HERO Pit Boss]]". Additionally, the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel|Rush Duel]]'' "HERO" series features the “[[Rising HERO]]" series, with other new HERO cards to come. The archetype also includes two [[Spell Card]]s ("[[HERO's Bond]]" and "[[Legacy of a HERO]]") and two [[Skill Card]]s ("[[HEROES UNITE - FUSION!!]]" and "[[HERO World]]").

  |}

  == Naming ==
  === ''OCG'' ===
  The Japanese cards use 「{{Ruby|Ｅ・ＨＥＲＯ|エレメンタルヒーロー}}」, 「{{Ruby|Ｅ－ＨＥＲＯ|イービルヒーロー}}」, 「{{Ruby|Ｅ☆ＨＥＲＯ|エンターテイメントヒーロー}}」 「{{Ruby|Ｃ・ＨＥＲＯ|コントラスト・ヒーロー}}」, 「{{Ruby|Ｄ－ＨＥＲＯ|デステニーヒーロー}}」, 「{{Ruby|Ｍ・ＨＥＲＯ|マスクドヒーロー}}」, 「{{Ruby|Ｖ・ＨＥＲＯ|ヴィジョンヒーロー}}」 and 「{{Ruby|Ｘ・ＨＥＲＯ|エクストラヒーロー}}」 at the start of their names so only those eight would work with 「{{Ruby|ＨＥＲＯ|ヒーロー}}」. Note that "Elemental HERO", "Evil HERO", and "Entertainment HERO" use 「Ｅ・ＨＥＲＯ」, 「Ｅ－ＨＥＲＯ」, and 「Ｅ☆ＨＥＲＯ」, and their furigana is different: "Elemental HERO" monsters have 「エレメンタルヒーロー」, "Evil HERO" monsters have 「イービルヒーロー」, and "Entertainment HERO" monsters have 「エンターテイメントヒーロー」.

  ==== ''TCG'' ====
  In the ''TCG'' originally, card text supporting this archetype specified "Elemental Hero" and "Destiny Hero" monsters separately, rather than supporting this as an independent archetype; after the release of "Evil Hero" cards in the ''TCG'', support cards for this archetype began to specify all three sub-themes ("Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero" and "Evil Hero"). This was done in the old texts of "[[Elemental Hero Stratos]]", "[[Elemental Hero Ocean]]", "[[Elemental Hero Divine Neos]]", "[[Evil Hero Infernal Prodigy]]", "[[Elemental Hero Absolute Zero]]", and "[[Hero's Bond]]". The original print of "[[Card Errata:Elemental HERO Divine Neos|Elemental Hero Divine Neos]]" was the only card to reference this archetype (albeit as "Hero"), although it only did so after already specifying that those same monsters must be "Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero" or "Evil Hero" monsters.

  As part of the introduction of [[Problem-Solving Card Text]], in anticipation of the upcoming release of "[[Masked HERO]]" and "[[Vision HERO]]" cards, this archetype was introduced to the ''TCG'' as an independent archetype named "HERO". Starting in ''[[Generation Force]]'', "Elemental Hero", "Destiny Hero" and "Evil Hero" were renamed "Elemental HERO", "Destiny HERO" and "Evil HERO", respectively; and "Masked HERO" and "Vision HERO" had their names capitalized accordingly. "HERO" is rendered in all capital letters to distinguish members from cards such as "[[Hero Kid]]" and "[[Oscillo Hero]]", which have "Hero" in their names but are not part of this archetype.<ref name="part2">{{cite web |url=https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=2915 |title=Problem-Solving Card Text, Part 2: New Words & Phrases |last=Tewart |first=Kevin |author-link=Kevin Tewart |publisher=[[Konami]] |date=May 23, 2011 |access-date=October 16, 2022}}</ref>

  In addition, two Spell Cards were renamed to align with the ''OCG'': "HERO Flash!!" was renamed to "[[Hero Flash!!]]" (to exclude it) and "Hero's Bond" was renamed to "[[HERO's Bond]]" (to include it).

  == Playing style ==
  {{See also|Elemental HERO#Playing style|Destiny HERO#Playing style|Evil HERO#Plyaing style|Masked HERO#Playing style|Vision HERO#Playing style|Neo-Spacian#Playing style}}

  Due to the "HERO" archetype being generally divided across a few sub-archetypes, the overall playstyle of the "HERO" archetype is objectively varied although common traits between the sub-archetypes show that the "HERO" archetype is predominantly a [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]]-based playstyle; they focus on swarming the field by [[Summon]]ing "HERO" monsters, as well as searching "HERO" monsters and/or their "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]"/"[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" [[Spell Card]]s needed to [[Special Summon]] their Fusion Monsters (usually by a [[Fusion Summon]]).

  Many members (despite also being a member of a specific "HERO" sub-archetype) have effects that support the entire "HERO" archetype as a whole. The overall "HERO" meta-archetype playstyle highlights some of the key "HERO" members which are almost always worth including:

  * The "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype (specifically, a few individual members) are vital combo pieces to the overall "HERO" meta-archetype playstyle. The most important "Elemental HERO" monster is "[[Elemental HERO Stratos]]", a non-once-per-turn searcher for all "HERO" monsters. It is the ideal choice to Special Summon and search with "[[A Hero Lives]]" and "[[E - Emergency Call]]" respectively. "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]" is also a once-per-turn searcher for all other "HERO" monsters when [[sent]] to the [[GY]] (usually by "[[Vision HERO Vyon]]"). "[[Elemental HERO Solid Soldier]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier|Liquid Soldier]]" are good monsters to [[Normal Summon]], as they can [[Special Summon]] needed "HERO" monsters (usually "Shadow Mist" or "Stratos" for their on-Summon Trigger Effects) and can generate more advantage if they are used as material for the Fusion Summon of a "HERO" Fusion Monster. "[[Elemental HERO Honest Neos|Honest Neos]]" is an [[ATK]]-booster for all "HERO" monsters. For their [[Fusion Monsters]] "[[Elemental HERO Sunrise|Sunrise]]" is a [[Fusion Monster]] with generic "HERO" [[Fusion Material]]s that can search out "[[Miracle Fusion]]", a powerful Fusion Spell Card that can use monsters in the [[GY]] as Fusion Materials, allowing another Fusion Summon with zero card loss to the [[field]] advantage. "[[Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage]]" requires 2 "Elemental HERO" monsters with different Attributes as materials and can search "[[Favorite Contact]]", a "[[Normal Trap Card]]" which can cheat out a Fusion Monster that mentions a "HERO" monster as material by returning the materials from the hand, field, GY or banishment to the Deck (the most powerful under this effect being "[[Elemental HERO Shining Neos Wingman]]" due to its non-targeting destruction for each [[Attribute]] on the field, which can also punish Attribute variety on the opponent's end). "[[Wake Up Your Elemental HERO]]" can be Fusion Summoned with any number of Warrior monsters which can close out games with its attacks or be strategically destroyed to Special Summon another Warrior (i.e. another "HERO" monster) from the Deck.
  * The "[[Destiny HERO]]" archetype is one of the backbones in the overall "HERO" meta-archetype playstyle, thanks to the [[Link Summon|Link 'climbing']] ability offered by "[[Destiny HERO - Malicious]]" and "[[Destiny HERO - Denier]]". "[[Xtra HERO Cross Crusader]]" combos especially well with "Malicious" as a searcher for all "HERO" monsters. The power offered by the "Destiny HERO" boss monsters ("[[Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer]]", "[[Destiny HERO - Dystopia]]" and "[[Destiny HERO - Plasma]]" in particular) also makes them popular for other "HERO" decks to include, especially when their Fusion Monsters can be Fusion Summoned with "[[Fusion Destiny]]" which can use materials from the Deck.
  * "[[Vision HERO]]" monsters generically support "HERO" monsters outside of their "vision" playstyle. The archetype strongly supports, and is strongly supported by the "HERO" meta-archetype, with general "HERO" support giving the archetype more flexibility, and "Vision HERO" itself giving other "HERO" sub-archetypes multiple extenders, situational tools, and boss monsters. The inclusion of the "Vision HERO" archetype is often compacted into an engine of "[[Vision HERO Faris|Faris]]", "[[Vision HERO Increase|Increase]]", and "[[Vision HERO Vyon|Vyon]]"; "Faris" will Special Summon itself from the hand and place "Increase" in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] who will then tribute "Faris" to Special Summon itself and "Vyon", then "Vyon" will send other "HERO" monsters to the GY for their GY effects (usually "Destiny HERO" monsters or "Elemental HERO Shadow Mist") and search out a "[[Polymerization]]" to enable "HERO" Fusion plays, all the while providing multiple "HERO" monsters on the field that can enable even more plays. Its Fusion Monsters, "[[Vision HERO Adoration|Adoration]]" and "[[Vision HERO Trinity|Trinity]]" can use any "HERO" monsters as material and the latter serves as a very useful game closer.
  * Although "[[Masked HERO]]" Fusion Monsters can only be Special Summoned with "[[Change]]" [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s rather than Fusion Summons, these cards are also worth including due to the few "Masked HERO" members with disruptive effects and "Change" cards can be searched with "Elemental HERO Shadow Mist". These "Masked HERO" monsters notably include "[[Masked HERO Dark Law|Dark Law]]" (for its passive one-sided "[[Macro Cosmos]]" and hand-rip effects, also being easy to Summon due to the majority of the key "HERO" monsters being DARK including "Shadow Mist", all "Destiny HEROs" and all "Vision HEROs"), "[[Masked HERO Acid|Acid]]" (by using "[[Elemental HERO Absolute Zero]]" to perform a board wipe), and "[[Masked HERO Blast]]" for dealing with Spell/Traps. "Change" Quick-Play Spells are also useful for allowing "HERO" monsters to "dodge" certain [[target]]ed disruptions.
  * "[[Evil HERO]]" offers the greater archetype Fusion Monsters best suited for brute force offense and - more importantly with the release of ''[[Supreme Darkness]]'' - additional routes to disruption when going first and/or playing the long game. The monsters "[[Evil HERO Adusted Gold|Adusted Gold]]" and "[[Evil HERO Inferno Wing - Backfire|Inferno Wing - Backfire]]" act as the keys to such plays, able to search "[[Dark Fusion]]" or any card mentioning it, including a reliable omni-negate at the end of "Evil HERO"-associated combos in "[[Dark Supremacy]]". "[[Evil HERO Infernal Rider|Infernal Rider]]" can also remotely set "[[Super Polymerization]]" and simultaneously bypass the "Evil HEROes'" restriction of only being Summoned off "Dark Fusion", enabling the Fusion Summon of various "HERO" Fusion Monsters, including "[[Evil HERO Neos Lord]]" whose synergy with "Super Polymerization" makes it a possible monster removal and indestructible walking "[[Change of Heart]]".
  * Finally, despite the majority of the "HERO" Extra Deck members being Fusion Monsters, a few of them are [[Link Monster]]s, those being the [[Xtra HERO]] series of monsters. These have effects which either support a specific sub-archetype (such as "[[Xtra HERO Cross Crusader]]" with "Destiny HERO" monsters) or ones that support the general shared playstyle of "HERO", such as "[[Xtra HERO Wonder Driver]]" recycling "Change", "[[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]]" or "[[Polymerization (archetype)|Polymerization]]" Spells.

  == Sample combos ==
  "HERO" can function decently well going first by virtue of chainable removal such as "Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer" and "Favorite Contact" to bring out "Shining Neos Wingman" during the opponent's turn, not to mention "Dark Law" posing a threat to Graveyard-reliant strategies and generation of hand advantage. However, they can excel going second due to their ability to accrue high ATK, burn the opponent, and set up opportunity to tag out into additional powerful monsters to continue their onslaught.

  Below is a sample combo with the following objectives:
  # Fusion Summon "[[Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer]]" to act as chainable, non-targeting removal during either player's turn.
  # Set up the Special Summon of "[[Elemental HERO Shining Neos Wingman]]" during the opponent's turn through a combination of the "[[Xtra HERO]]" monsters and "[[Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage]]".
  # Destroy "[[Wake Up Your Elemental HERO]]" to allow it to Summon "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]" in order to search "[[Mask Change]]" with which to Summon "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" to restrict the opponent's ability to generate card advantage or utilize their GY.

  # Use "Vyon's" on-Summon effect to send the remaining "Destiny HERO" mentioned above to the GY, then use its second effect to banish "Faris" from GY and search "[[Polymerization]]".
  # Link Summon "[[Xtra HERO Cross Crusader]]" using "Increase" and "Vyon", and use its effect to revive either "Destiny HERO" in your GY to Tribute with "Crusader's" second effect and search "[[Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier]]".
  # Banish "Malicious" from GY to Summon a copy of itself from the Deck, and use both it and "Crusader" to Link Summon "[[Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer]]", whose effect will reveal "[[Elemental HERO Shining Neos Wingman]]" in your Extra Deck to search its mentioned material "[[Elemental HERO Neos]]".
  # Use "Polymerization" to fuse "Neos" and "Liquid Soldier" into "[[Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage]]". Upon Summon, chain "Liquid Soldier's" effect in GY and "Infernal Rage's" in sequence to search "[[Favorite Contact]]" and subsequently draw two cards, then discard one (doing so will avoid the risk of drawing "Favorite Contact" by "Liquid Soldier's" effect, thereby whiffing "Infernal Rage's").
  # Given "Infernal Rage" was Summoned with a Normal Monster as material in the form of "Neos", Tribute it to Summon "[[Elemental HERO Sunrise]]" from your Extra Deck, who will search "[[Miracle Fusion]]" upon Summon.
  # Link Summon "[[Xtra HERO Wonder Driver]]" using "Infernal Devicer" and "Sunrise", then activate "Miracle Fusion" to banish "Infernal Rage" and "Neos" from your GY as material for "[[Wake Up Your Elemental HERO]]", who will be Summoned to "Wonder Driver's" pointed Monster Zone to activate its effect, targeting and Setting "Polymerization" from GY.
  # Since the second copy of "Malicious" is in your GY, use "Denier's" effect to Summon itself and subsequently take the first copy of "Malicious" from your banishment to place on top of your Deck, thereby allowing you to Summon it again.
  # After Summoning the recycled "Malicious" from your Deck by banishing the second from GY, use "Polymerization" to fuse it and "Denier" into "[[Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer]]", whose Quick Effect will destroy itself and "Wake Up", triggering the former's to allow it to revive during the next Standby Phase, and the latter's effect to Summon "Elemental HERO Shadow Mist" from hand or Deck and enable it to search "[[Mask Change]]". From here you can either use it to tag "Shadow Mist" into "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" right away, or reserve it for your opponent's turn to use "Shadow Mist's" GY effect to search a "HERO" monster.
  # Set "Favorite Contact" and pass turn, then when an opportunity arises, use it to place "Infernal Rage" and "Neos" back into the Deck and Summon "Shining Neos Wingman", which can both destroy the opponent's cards without targeting and unable to be returned (or "spun") to the Extra Deck given "Favorite Contact" placed "Neos" into the Deck.

  === Strengths ===
  * '''High consistency''' - "HERO" has numerous routes to start combos, which more often than not enable one another in virtually any order. "[[A Hero Lives]]", "[[Fusion Destiny]]", and "[[Evil Assault]]" are all Normal Spells that turn their respective sub-archetypes live without a necessary [[Normal Summon]]. Meanwhile "[[Vision HERO Faris]]" secures 1 - 2 setup pieces in GY, "[[Polymerization]]" in hand, and ample monsters on field to enable "Link climbing".
  * '''[[OTK]] potential''' - The archetype's [[Fusion Monster]]s in particular allow for high-powered attacks and beneficial effects on offense, as well as ability to tag out into other monsters to clear the field. "[[Wake Up Your Elemental HERO|Wake Up]]" and "[[Evil HERO Darkest Knight|Darkest Knight]]" both attack multiple times and "float" into additional monsters, "[[Elemental HERO Shining Neos Wingman|Shining Neos Wingman]]" easily overpowers high-ATK threats with its self-buff and burn effects, "[[Elemental HERO Sunrise|Sunrise]]" and "[[Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer|Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer]]" modulate ATK to ease battle, and "[[Destiny HERO - Plasma|Plasma]]" both disables and "absorbs" other monsters to make opposing boards more manageable.
  * '''Non-targeting removal''' - In particular, "Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer" and "Shining Neos Wingman" do not target opposing cards for destruction. "[[Evil HERO Neos Lord|Neos Lord]]" can also "steal" an opponent's monster whilst being Summoned with "[[Super Polymerization]]" (whose activation cannot be responded to), as its secondary material requires one [[Effect Monster]] on the field.
  * '''"[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]"''' - This card is worth noting as both a method to disable use of the opponent's GY and punishing searching or generation of hand advantage. Given [[DARK]] is one of the most represented [[Attributes]] among "HERO" monsters (especially ones imperative for setup such as "Faris" and "Vyon"), it is also easy to access this card via "[[Mask Change]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * '''Board breakers''' - "[[Raigeki]]", "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]", and "[[Evenly Matched]]" in particular prove a struggle for "HERO" due to their inherent lack of protection, with few exceptions.
  * '''"Feast or famine" disruption''' - "HERO" end boards are generally reliant on being able to set up their combos to completion. Should one particular step be disrupted in some form or another, it can potentially disable the other(s) in sequence (For example, "[[Xtra HERO Cross Crusader|Cross Crusader]]" depends on a "[[Destiny HERO]]" in GY to enable its search effect, otherwise other searchers or pieces may be inaccessible), therefore resulting in a limited ability to interact with the opponent the following turn. "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" is an especially egregious case due to the number of pieces "HERO" searches from Deck. As such, they're heavily reliant on cards like "[[Called by the Grave]]", "[[Forbidden Droplet]]", and "[[Crossout Designator]]" to play through common handtraps and disruptions.
  * '''Floodgates''' - Cards like "[[There Can Be Only One]]" and "[[Gozen Match]]" can significantly limit "HERO"'s ability to Summon its monsters, due to their commonly-shared [[Type]]s and variety of Attributes (with the exception of "Destiny HERO", whom are all [[DARK]]).
  * '''High reliance on [[Extra Deck]]''' - Virtually all of "HERO"'s main pieces are Summoned from the Extra Deck, so cards like "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" and "[[Nekroz of Unicore]]" which would compromise their ability to utilize it severely damage their performance.
