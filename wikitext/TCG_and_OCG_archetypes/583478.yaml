  == Playing style ==
  "Infinitracks" focus on quickly Summoning [[EARTH]] Machine monsters in order to perform high-Rank Xyz Summons.

  Most Main Deck "Infinitracks" are [[Level]] 5 monsters that can be Special Summoned from hand by Tributing an EARTH Machine monster. The Level 5s each have effects that banish themselves or a Machine monster from the GY for advantage.
  * "[[Infinitrack Brutal Dozer|Brutal Dozer]]" is the Deck's key card as it allows for an immediate summon of "[[Infinitrack River Stormer]]", though it locks the player into EARTH Machines. 
  * "[[Infinitrack Tunneller|Tunneller]]" is another major card; it can banish itself and shuffle 5 EARTH Machine monsters from the GY to draw 2 cards, acting as a way to access more non-engine cards.
  The two non-Level 5 monsters either [[Infinitrack Harvester|search]] for resources or [[Infinitrack Anchor Drill|provide material]] for a Summon, and can target a Machine to change both of their Levels to their combined level. (7 for "[[Infinitrack Harvester|Harvester]]", 9 for "[[Infinitrack Anchor Drill|Anchor Drill]]").

  The Xyz monsters, meanwhile, can each summon themselves from the GY by Tributing a Machine Link monster. This combos with "[[Infinitrack Goliath]]", which when sent to the GY can attach itself to any Xyz, and gives Machine Xyz destruction protection. The in-archetype boss monster, "[[Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops]]", is a 4000 ATK monster that is unaffected by non-Xyz monster effects, though its steep Summoning requirement (3 Xyz monsters) makes it relatively difficult to Summon. "Megaclops" has been used by other Decks such as "[[Zoodiac]]" and "[[Numeron]]".

  The Deck synergizes with other EARTH Machine themes, such as "[[Machina]]" and "[[Train]]", due to shared Machine / EARTH Machine support. The card "[[Outrigger Extension]]" also gives the deck access to a variety of [[Extra Deck]] Machine boss monsters - including the likes of "[[Kashtira Arise-Heart]]" (''OCG''/Traditional Format) and "[[Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Juggernaut Liebe]]" - by using it to the rank up the Xyz "Infinitrack".
