  }}
  "'''Igknight'''" (イグナイト ''Igunaito'') is an archetype of [[FIRE]] [[Warrior]] [[Pendulum Monster|Pendulum]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] which debuted in ''[[Clash of Rebellions]]''. They were used by [[Shuto Go]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V The Strongest Duelist Yuya!!]] manga. 

  It is connected to the "[[Dracoslayer]]" storyline. It is also related to "[[Majespecter]]s" and "[[Dinomist]]s", as each are Pendulum archetypes that have a member part of the "[[Dracoslayer]]" archetype.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  The original six Pendulum "Igknights" are entirely 1 specific color from the color wheel: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple. For all 3 of the warm colors ("Margrave", "Templar" and "Squire"), the corresponding "Igknights" are the higher scale (7), which is usually paired with the red scale, which is also a warm color. The same can be said for the 3 cool colors ("Gallant", "Crusader" and "Paladin"). They are all the lower scale (2), which is usually paired with the blue scale, a cool color. "Cavalier" breaks this pattern, being a Scale 2 (blue) Pendulum with a warm color (pink). As well is "Veteran", being a Scale 7 (red) Pendulum with a cool color (light blue).

  === Etymology ===
  The name "Igknight" is a pun on the words "ignite" and "knight". In the ''OCG'', the majority of the archetype's members are named for various makes and models of guns and ammunition, and wield gunblades inspired by said guns with various types of blade attachments.

  In the ''TCG'', these names were changed to place more emphasis on the "knight" part of the name, rather than "ignite", by naming the members after medieval military positions (or other terms related to chivalric ideas).

  == Members ==
  With the exception of "[[Igknight Lancer|Lancer]]" and "[[Igknight Champion|Champion]]", which are non-Pendulum Effect Monsters, each "Igknight" is a [[Normal Pendulum Monster]] with a Scale of 2 or 7.

  == Playing style ==
  Most "Igknight" monsters are Normal Pendulum Monsters that share the following Pendulum effect:

  :''If you have an "Igknight" card in your other Pendulum Zone: You can destroy both cards in your Pendulum Zones, and if you do, add 1 FIRE Warrior-Type monster from your Deck or Graveyard to your hand.''

  This can search the correct Pendulum Scales while sending the destroyed monsters to the Extra Deck, enabling a mass Pendulum Summon. From there, the monsters can be used for various [[Extra Deck]] plays. (This strategy was nerfed by the [[New Master Rule]], which limited Pendulum Summoning from the Extra Deck.)  As a whole, the archetype can be combined with other Pendulum archetypes due to their scale-fixing effect, or with other FIRE Warrior archetypes like "[[Infernoble Knight]]".

  "[[Igknight Lancer|Lancer]]" and "[[Igknight Champion|Champion]]" are searchable Effect Monsters that can destroy 3 "Igknight" cards to summon themselves, and have board breaking effects, though they do not fit into the above "Igknight" gameplan.

  As an archetype of Warrior Normal Monsters, they benefit from support like "[[Reinforcement of the Army]]", "[[Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights]]" (''OCG'' / Traditional Format only), and "[[Summoner's Art]]". A pure Deck could also play dedicated Normal Monster support like "[[Skill Drain]]", "[[Summoner's Art]]", "[[First of the Dragons]]", and "[[Heart of the Underdog]]".
