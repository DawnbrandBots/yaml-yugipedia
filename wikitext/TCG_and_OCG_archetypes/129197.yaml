  "'''Scrap'''" (スクラップ ''Sukurappu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Duelist Revolution]]''. They are used by [[Toru]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2011: Over the Nexus]]'', [[Heartland Tower Security Robot]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' and [[Naoki Shima|Battle Braver]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]''.
  The [[Scrap-Iron]] series is not a part of this archetype, since its Japanese name, 「くず{{Ruby|鉄|てつ}}の」, does not contain 「スクラップ」 in it. However, because the ''[[TCG]]'' and ''[[OCG]]'' support for this archetype only works on [[Monster Cards]], this is not an issue. "[[Raviel, Lord of Phantasms - Shimmering Scraper]]", on the other hand, isn't part of this archetype but doesn't have an [[archetype-exclusion condition]].
  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  As their name suggests, "Scrap" monsters are all made of old, rusty fragments of steel, but in spite of their appearance and name, to date, only 4 of these monsters are [[Machine]]: "[[Scrap Hunter]]", "[[Scrap Mind Reader]]", "[[Scrap Breaker]]" and "[[Scrap Recycler]]".
  ===Etymology===
  "[[wikipedia:Scrap|Scrap]]" is discarded metal for reprocessing.
  ==Playing style==
  "Scrap" monsters focus on [[destroy]]ing one another with their own effects (maybe reflecting the fact they are made of scrap, being fragile and easily collapsible) and setting up [[Synchro Summon]]s. Many "Scrap" monsters have effects that activate when they are destroyed by the effect of a "Scrap" card, and each of those has an effect that can destroy themselves. Their destruction also allows the effects of "[[Scrap Factory]]" and "[[Scrap Wyvern]]" to activate and [[Special Summon]] "Scrap" monsters from the Deck, especially "[[Scrap Golem]]" to use its effect to Special Summon a "Scrap" monster from the Graveyard.

  Many of their Spells and Traps also destroy "Scrap" monsters. In particular, "[[Scrapstorm]]" and "[[Scrap Sheen]]" being [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s means they can be chained to the activation of an opponent's non-"Scrap" cards that would destroy a "Scrap" monster, to ensure their effects activate. Furthermore, they can be chained to an activated "Scrap" monster's effect that either destroys itself or targets a monster to destroy, allowing them to give the player additional advantage for a monster that will be destroyed anyways. This is especially useful in combination with "[[Scrap Raptor]]", as it gives the player an additional [[Normal Summon]] regardless of whether the monster it targeted is still on the field.

  Their strongest monsters are their [[Synchro Monster]]s, "[[Scrap Dragon]]", "[[Scrap Twin Dragon]]" and "[[Atomic Scrap Dragon]]"; each of them has an effect to destroy 1 card the player controls and disrupt the opponent's field or Graveyard. This gives them access to powerful field-clearing capabilities while further activating the effects of the weaker "Scrap" monsters. Furthermore, each of these Synchro Monsters will Special Summon a non-Synchro "Scrap" monster from the Graveyard when they are destroyed by an opponent's card. It's worth noting, however, that "Scrap Twin Dragon" and "Atomic Scrap Dragon" must be able to destroy the card the player controls in order to use their effects, so the aforementioned "Scrapstorm" and "Scrap Sheen" should not be used to destroy the player's targeted monster.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Cards that prevent cards from entering the Graveyard, like "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]", or cards that prevent Graveyard effects from activating, like "[[Soul Drain]]" and "[[Abyss Dweller]]", can prevent "Scrap" monsters from activating their effects, although the latter will still allow "Scrap Factory" to activate and neither prevents "Scrap Wyvern" from activating and destroying the offending card.
  * The archetype has monsters with a variety of Types, so they can be impeded by "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]".
  * Cards that restrict Special Summoning, such as "[[El Shaddoll Winda]]", can limit the amount of board presence the archetype can muster.
  * The archetype often relies on "Scrap Factory" to start swarming, so destroying it before it can activate its effect can be detrimental.
