  "'''Djinn'''" ({{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|人|じん}} ''Majin'') is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] monsters. The intended members of the archetype, i.e. the monsters that receive "Djinn" archetypal support, are all [[Xyz Monster]]s used by [[Yuma Tsukumo]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]''. Gameplay-wise, they mostly focus on anti-Xyz tactics while also [[support]]ing one another via their own [[Monster effect|effects]].
  Due to their Japanese names, a number of older cards, such as the "[[Djinn of Rituals]]" series ("Ritual Djinns") and "[[Dark Balter the Terrible]]" ("Djinn Dark Balter"), also fall into this archetype. However, because their ''TCG'' and ''OCG'' support only works on Xyz Monsters, the only other cards which receive support from them are "[[Queen Dragun Djinn]]", "[[Number 65: Djinn Buster]]" and "[[CXyz Mechquipped Djinn Angeneral]]".

  == Design ==
  [[File:MusicMajin.png|left|thumb|150px|The symbol of the musical "Djinn".]]
  The intended members of the "Djinn" archetype are all two-horned, musician-like monsters.
  Their symbol is a musical [[wikipedia:Eighth note|eighth note]] featuring a fiendish-looking face.

  == Trivia ==
  * "Musical Djinn" monsters are the only monsters whose Korean names include [[wikipedia:Hangul|Hangul]] as base text and [[wikipedia:Hanja|Hanja]] as [[wikipedia:Ruby text|ruby text]], to avoid any confusion caused by the Hangul text.
