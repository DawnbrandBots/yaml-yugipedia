  }}
  "'''Utopic'''", known as "'''Hope'''" (ホープ ''Hōpu'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of cards related to "[[Number 39: Utopia]]". Due to its Japanese name, it encompasses the entire "[[Utopia (archetype)|Utopia]]" archetype, and consequently includes its sub-archetypes "[[Number 39: Utopia (archetype)|Number 39: Utopia]]" and "[[Number C39: Utopia Ray (archetype)|Number C39: Utopia Ray]]".
  In the ''TCG'', due to several "Utopic" cards having "Utopia" in their name instead ("Utopia" itself being a sub-archetype of "Utopic", making all members of the former also part of the latter by default), the two are treated as separate archetypes, with the ''TCG'' accounting for this by listing the "Utopia" archetype on all "Utopic" support cards.
  Due to their Japanese names, a number of cards such as "[[Dystopia the Despondent]]", "[[Worm Hope]]", and "[[Fifth Hope]]" also fall into this archetype. However, because ''TCG''/''OCG'' support for this archetype only works on [[Xyz Monster]]s, this is not an issue. In addition, "[[Number 98: Antitopian]]" is also a "Utopic" monster, but the support cards for this archetype exclude it by variously listing an additional requirement (needing 3 or more materials, being [[LIGHT]], or being [[Rank]] 10 or higher). In [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links|Duel Links]], [[Skill|Skills]] which support "Utopic" Xyz Monsters also specifically list "Antitopian" in TCG-region languages. "[[Utopic Onomatopoeia]]" is not a member of this archetype, as it does not have 「ホープ」 in it's Japanese name.
