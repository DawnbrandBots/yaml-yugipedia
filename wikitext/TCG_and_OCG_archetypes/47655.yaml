  "'''Flamvell'''" (フレムベル ''Furemuberu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] whose [[Monster effect|effects]] include burning away the opponent's [[LP]] and increasing each others' [[ATK]]. Many of their effects are triggered when they inflict [[Battle damage]] or destroy a monster as a result of battle. They are introduced in ''[[Duel Terminal - Synchro Awakening!!]]'' with further support in ''[[Duel Terminal - Invasion of Worms!!]]''. They are introduced to the ''[[TCG]]'' through the [[Booster Pack]] ''[[Ancient Prophecy]]'', with "[[Flamvell Commando]]" as a ''TCG''-exclusive, with further cards coming through the [[Booster Pack]] ''[[Hidden Arsenal]]''. Aside from being FIRE monsters, the majority of them have 200 DEF, and have support based around that. [[Bob]] had "[[Flamvell Guard (anime)|Flamvell Guard]]" in his [[Deck]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime.

  The Neo Flamvell sub-series was released in ''[[Duel Terminal - Pulse of the Trishula!!]]''. These monsters are more focused on [[Graveyard]] control, especially by [[banish]]ing the opponent's cards.

  == Lore ==
  The Flamvell are one of the 4 original [[Duel Terminal]] factions that fought against the invading [[Worm]]s.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Flamvell" archetype is made of FIRE monsters and tuners which mostly have 200 [[DEF]], alongside multiple cards that can summon Flamvells or other monsters with said traits, such as through "[[Flamvell Firedog]]" or "[[Rekindling]]", which can revive up to 5 of these monsters at once. From there, the player can attack with those monsters and/or Synchro Summon with them. The monsters from "[[Rekindling]]" can be further boosted by tributing one [[Pyro]] monster with "[[Flamvell Archer]]" (which is itself [[Pyro]]) in order to give all Flamvells 800 more ATK for one turn. This can allow for a one-turn-kill, the clearing of opponent's high ATK monsters(especially if buffing a Flamvell [[Synchro Monster]]), and even allow "[[Flamvell Firedog]]" to summon another tuner for another [[Synchro Summon]]. "[[Rekindling]]" can also find niche use in its ability to provide 3 or more monsters for a tribute summon in one turn. 

  Unfortunately, the Flamvell archetype is very outdated, and even at its release the Flamvells and other [[Duel Terminal]] synchro archetypes were hurt by overly cautious balancing. Their boss monsters "[[Flamvell Uruquizas]]" and "[[Ancient Flamvell Deity]]" had limited staying power even through their ATK stat, so a modern Flamvell deck will prefer to use generic Synchro options rather than stay in-archetype.

  The Main Deck Flamvell monsters also boast a various, somewhat inconsistent range of effects, including special summoning, searching, ATK boosts, and burn effects.  The Neo Flamvell series follows this pattern while adding effects that banish cards from the opponent's graveyard and a couple cards like that benefit from keeping their graveyard small, though this is very difficult as even spells and traps count towards the small limit of no more than 3 or 4 cards required for benefits.

  The two main searchers in the "Flamvell" deck are "[[Flamvell Firedog]]" and "[[Flamvell Poun]]." "[[Flamvell Firedog]]" can be used offensively while maintaining card advantage and allowing for a one-turn [[Synchro Summon]] while [[Flamvell Poun]] sports an old-school "search on death" type effect for defensive situations.

  These searchers can search tuners of all 4 lower levels from 1-4 from within the archetype, with non-archetype options as well. "[[Flamvell Magician]]," a level 4 [[Tuner]] searched by [[Flamvell Firedog|Firedog]] was one of the earliest consistent ways to make a level 8 synchro, level 3 "[[Flamvell Archer]]" could find great use later with "[[Rekindling]]," level 1 "[[Flamvell Baby]]" could permanently raise a monster's ATK slightly by discarding itself from the hand, and level 2 "[[Neo Flamvell Origin]]" can potentially special summon itself from the hand early in the game.

  Konami recently released a new "Flamvell" card in the form of "[[Neo Flamvell Lady]]". As a quick effect, she can discard a [[FIRE]] monster from the hand into a combined "[[D.D. Crow]]" and "[[Foolish Burial]]" for "[[Rekindling]]" targets.

  "Flamvell" are heavily reliant on outside support to cover their weaknesses and relatively straight-forward playstyle. "[[Red Resonator]]" is massively helpful and can, depending on the starting hand, help going into Link-3 monsters; as a bonus, its 200 DEF makes it a valid target for "Rekindling", allowing its LP gain effect to be activated. "[[Royal Firestorm Guards]]" can sometimes be used for card advantage, and the deck can also be alongside some "[[Volcanic]]" and "[[Laval]]" cards, as those archetypes and "[[Rekindling]]" all appreciate having more [[FIRE]] monsters sent to the graveyard.

  Overall, the Flamvell archetype lends itself to either a synchro strategy or OTK strategy with "[[Rekindling]]" acting as their signature card to bring these strategies about.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Since both "[[Rekindling]]" and "[[Flamvell Firedog]]" play a large part in most "Flamvell" decks, cards like "[[Vanity's Ruler]]", "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]", and "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" harshly stifle these decks.
  * A "[[Macro Cosmos]]" deck, or any other deck that prevents monsters from staying in the graveyard, will destroy the strategy by making it impossible to use "[[Rekindling]]"'s effect to its full extent.
  * "[[Prohibition]]" or "[[Armageddon Designator]]" can also prevent the use of "[[Rekindling]]", making it much harder to win.
  * "[[Necrovalley]]" and "[[Silent Graveyard]]" can also now stop "[[Rekindling]]" in the TCG since TCG/OCG rulings merged.
