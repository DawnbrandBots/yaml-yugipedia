  "'''Flamvell'''" (フレムベル ''Furemuberu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Monster Card|monsters]], with most having [[200 DEF Monster Cards|200 DEF]], first released in ''[[Duel Terminal - Synchro Awakening!!]]'' (''[[OCG]]'') and ''[[Ancient Prophecy]]'' (''[[TCG]]''). [[Bob]] had "[[Flamvell Guard (anime)|Flamvell Guard]]" in his [[Deck]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime.

  The Neo Flamvell sub-series was released in ''[[Duel Terminal - Pulse of the Trishula!!]]''. These monsters are more focused on [[Graveyard]] control, especially by [[banish]]ing the opponent's cards.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines|Master Duel card storylines#Alliance for Justice}}

  The Flamvell are one of the 4 original [[Duel Terminal]] factions that fought against the invading [[Worm]]s. 

  == Playing style ==
  "Flamvell" is an archetype of FIRE monsters with primarily 200 DEF. Decks using "Flamvell" cards typically focus on getting valid monsters to the GY in order to make the most out of "[[Rekindling]]". The monsters, however, do not explicitly promote this playstyle. The "Neo Flamvell" series instead focuses on banishing from the opponent GY, with some effects only being usable if the opponent has few cards in GY. Meanwhile, the older monsters tended to focus on battle and ATK gain effects, with some cards dealing burn damage as well.

  The archetype's main playmaker, as mentioned previously, is "[[Rekindling]]", which can Summon as many FIRE monsters with 200 DEF as possible from the GY. These monsters then can be used for various [[Extra Deck]] plays (generally [[Synchro]] plays), and/or setting up [[OTK]]s.

  The Deck's main searchers are "[[Flamvell Firedog]]" (Summons when it destroys by battle) and "[[Flamvell Poun]]" (searches when destroyed by battle), although both are very slow for the modern game. The Deck could set up various Synchro plays through "Firedog", which could Summon Tuners from Levels 1-4. E.g., "[[Flamvell Magician]]" was useful as a Level 4 Tuner, with "Firedog" + "Magician" being one of the earliest ways for a consistent Level 8 Synchro. "[[Neo Flamvell Lady]]" is a relatively recent support card; it is a [[hand trap]] that acts as a "[[D.D. Crow]]" that also sends a FIRE Monster with 200 DEF or less to the GY, at the cost of a FIRE monster discard.

  The Extra Deck "Flamvell" monsters have limited staying power, so Decks would typically rely on generic Synchro options instead.

  Due to the archetype ("Rekindling" in particular) supporting generic FIRE monsters with 200 DEF, the archetype has synergy with other archetypes/cards that match that criteria, such as "[[Laval]]", "[[Fire King]]", and "[[Red Resonator]]". "[[Volcanic]]" can also be included as both are FIRE Pyro Decks that use the GY. However, since the most recent "Flamvell" card (outside of "Neo Flamvell Lady") was released in 2011, those Decks would often use "Rekindling" on its own.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As an archetype meant for the Duel Terminal machines - which had a much lower power level than the OCG/TCG, even for the time - it struggles with some core issues relating to Deck strength. In addition, the only new card for the archetype since 2011 was "[[Neo Flamvell Lady]]".
  ** Many of their effects revolve around battle, which has become less relevant as the game sped up. In particular, the archetype's main searchers, "Firedog" and "Poun", both require the Battle Phase, so they can't search on Turn 1.
  ** Several monsters cannot use their effects if the opponent has too many cards in GY.
  * Floodgates: Since the archetype relies a lot on "[[Rekindling]]" to make its major plays, anything that can stop it is important
  ** Anti-GY floodgates, like "[[Macro Cosmos]]" and "[[Necrovalley]]", prevent "Rekindling" from being useful.
  ** Anti-Special Summon floodgates, like "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" and "[[Vanity's Ruler]]", can do the same.
  * Due to "Rekindling" being so fundamental to the Deck, preventing its use with a card like "[[Prohibition]]" can be deadly.
