  "'''Dual Avatar'''" ({{Ruby|双|そう}}{{Ruby|天|てん}} ''Sōten'', lit. "Dual Sky") is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Warrior]] monsters that debut in ''[[Phantom Rage]]''.

  == Etymology ==
  This archetype is based on the paired guardian figures found in East Asian Buddhist and Japanese Shinto architecture, the muscular ''[[wikipedia:Nio|kongōrikishi]]'' (金剛力士) and the lion-like ''[[wikipedia:Komainu|komainu]]'' (狛犬). Both designs are conceptually related to the concept of ''[[wikipedia:A-un|A-un]]'', the first and the last letters of the Devanagari abugida that symbolically represent the beginning and the end of all things, and this concept is also referenced in the design of the archetype.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Duel Avatar" playstyle revolves around making use of its two Main Deck monsters, "[[Dual Avatar Fists - Yuhi]]" and "[[Dual Avatar Feet - Kokoku]]", as well as its ability to generate Tokens to summon multiple Fusion Monsters at once. This is done through their Spell Card, "[[Dual Avatar Invitation]]", and its ability to summon up to five "[[Dual Avatar Spirit Token]]s" and [[Fusion Summon]] up to two "Dual Avatar" Fusion Monsters at the cost of not being able to Special Summon from the Extra Deck outside of Fusion Monsters for the turn. The four "Dual Avatar" Fusions are divided between the more offense-focused members, Level 6 "[[Dual Avatar Fists - Armored Ah-Gyo]]" and Level 8 "[[Dual Avatar - Empowered Kon-Gyo]]", and the more defensive-focused monsters, Level 5 "[[Dual Avatar Feet - Armored Un-Gyo]]" and Level 7 "[[Dual Avatar - Empowered Mitsu-Jaku]]". Propelling this theme is its abundance of Spells and Traps that destroy your own monsters in order to disrupt the opponent or Summon other "Dual Avatar" Fusion Monsters. Especially of note is their Trap Card "[[Dual Avatar Compact]]", which lets you banish a "Dual Avatar" Spell or Trap from the GY to use its effect again, helping to create multiple Fusions on either turn or disrupt the opponent with the effect of "[[Dual Avatar Defeating Evil]]".

  == Weaknesses ==
  The main issue faced by "Dual Avatar" is the ability to quickly lose steam after making their Fusions. With precise methods of removal, the Deck will fall apart and leave you open to attacks. As such, it is important to keep track of which Fusion Monsters are being made in the moment to not let the board be demolished and the player left open to attacks.
