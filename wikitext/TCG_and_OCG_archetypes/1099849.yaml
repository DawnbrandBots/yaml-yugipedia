  "'''Schoolwork'''" ({{Ruby|祝|しゅく}}{{Ruby|台|だい}} ''Shukudai'') is an archetype of [[Trap Card]]s introduced in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]''. It currently only consists of one card, "[[Summer Schoolwork Successful!]]", which is a [[Duel winner]].

  ==Etymology==
  In Japanese, ''Shukudai'' means "homework", but rather than the usual kanji 「宿題」, this theme uses the homophonous 「祝台」, which roughly means "(place of) celebration".
