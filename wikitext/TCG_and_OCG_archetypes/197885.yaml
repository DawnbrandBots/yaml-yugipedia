  "'''Geargia'''" (ギアギア ''Giagia'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that resemble gears, as the archetype name suggests. They focus on [[swarm]] and [[Xyz Summon]] tactics. The first member, "[[Geargiano]]", appeared in ''[[Generation Force]]''; additional members and the archetype's first [[support]] appeared in ''[[Return of the Duelist]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|V Jump Duelist Set Specials card storylines#Version Machine-Gear Troopers|Master Duel card storylines#Gears of Justice dispatch!}}

  == Design ==
  The "Geargia" archetype is primarily comprised of Level 3 "[[Geargiano (archetype)|Geargiano]]" monsters and Level 4 "Geargia" monsters. The archetype also features two Extra Deck Xyz Monsters that support the archetype.
  * The "Geargiano" monsters are cartoonified depictions of gearboxes, with gear-formed cartoon eyes and arms. Each of them also makes one of the rock-paper-scissors shapes with one of their hands.
  * The Level 4 "Geargia" monsters take the form of cartoon vehicles, each of which contains one "Geargiano" monster as its "driver".
  ** There are two sub-types of Level 4 "Geargia" monsters; 3 of them have effects that are trigged when they are flipped up, while the other 3 don't. Each sub-type contains one monster driven by one of the three "Geargiano" monsters.
  * The Extra Deck monsters take the form of large humanoid machines made out of cartoon gears, and contain multiple "Geargiano" monsters in them.

  == Playing style ==
  "Geargia" is a "ramp" Control or Combo-Control Deck, focusing on gaining [[advantage]] while swarming the field to summon Rank 3/4 Xyz monsters. Unlike a combo Deck, many of its starters require a turn to set up; "[[Geargiarmor]]" needs to be flipped up, while "[[Geargiagear]]" is a Trap card. A typical play is to set "Geargiarmor" along with various Traps on Turn 1, then combo off on the following turn (searching "[[Geargiaccelerator]]", make "[[Gear Gigant X]]", then search based on the variant).

  === Cards ===
  Important Main Deck monsters include:
  * "[[Geargiarmor]]", which searches a "Geargia" monster on flip, and can flip itself face-down once per turn.
  * "[[Geargiarsenal]]" and "[[Geargiauger]]" are consistency tools. "Arsenal" Tributes itself to summon a "Geargia" from Deck, while "Auger", on Normal Summon, searches for a "Geargia" monster from Deck.
  * "[[Geargiaccelerator]]", which can Special Summon itself (non-[[once per turn]]) if a "Geargia" monster is on field, acting as the main extender / search target.
  * The "[[Geargiano]]" monsters, which are Level 3 targets for "[[Geargiagear]]". The original "Geargiano" Tributes itself to revive a Level 4 or lower Machine. "[[Geargiano Mk-II|MK-II]]", when Normal or Flip Summoned, can Special Summon a "Geargia" monster from hand/GY. "[[Geargiano Mk-III|MK-III]]", when Special Summoned by a "Geargia" card, can Special Summon a "Geargia" monster from hand/GY.

  The main Xyz monster is "[[Gear Gigant X]]", which can search a Level 4 or lower Machine, and summons a Level 3 "Geargia" when it leaves the field. Meanwhile, "[[Geargiagear Gigant XG]]" is the in-house finisher; it is the highest ATK monster of the archetype and can negate all cards in the Battle Step. When it leaves the field, it can add a "Geargia" card from GY to hand.

  "[[Geargia Change]]" can reborn 2 or more "Geargiano" monsters, then immediately Xyz summons using only those monsters. "[[Geargiagear]]" is a Trap that can summon 2 Level 3 monsters from Deck, then raise their levels by 1, enabling an easy "Gear Gigant X". 

  Due to "[[Gear Gigant X]]" being able to search for any Level 4 or lower Machine, the Deck mixes well with other Machine archetypes, such as "[[Karakuri]]" (whose position-changing effects can trigger "Geargiarmor" again) and "[[Machina]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The archetype has not received any new cards since 2016, leaving it too slow for the modern state of the game.
  * "Geargia" monsters have relatively low [[ATK]], the highest being "[[Gear Gigant X]]" (2300 ATK) and "[[Geargiagear Gigant XG]]" (2500 ATK). This means that they can be beat over by common monsters like "[[Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack]]", "[[Evilswarm Ophion]]" and "[[Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos]]".
  ** Using cards that alter monster's ATK, such as "[[Limiter Removal]]" and "[[Forbidden Lance]]" as well as using more powerful support monsters such as "[[Karakuri Shogun mdl 00 "Burei"]]" and "[[Karakuri Steel Shogun mdl 00X "Bureido"]]" can help with battling an opponent's monster(s).
  * "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" and "[[System Down]]" can easily clear the field of "Geargia" and supporting Machine monsters.
  * "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" shuts down all searching within the Deck. It can also negate the Special Summoning of Synchro and Xyz Monsters, which can ruin the win condition of "Geargia".
  * "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]" and other cards that prevent Special Summoning prevents nearly every "Geargia" monster from using their effects, as well as preventing them from Summoning monsters from their Extra Deck.
  * Since this Deck's strategy relies a lot on "[[Geargiarmor]]", negating its effect to search for a "Geargia" monster and set itself backdown can stop the Deck's momentum completely.
