  "'''Geargia'''" (ギアギア ''Giagia'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that resemble gears, as the archetype name suggests. They focus on [[swarm]] and [[Xyz Summon]] tactics. The first member, "[[Geargiano]]", appeared in ''[[Generation Force]]''; additional members and the archetype's first [[support]] appeared in ''[[Return of the Duelist]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|V Jump Duelist Set Specials card storylines#Version Machine-Gear Troopers|Master Duel card storylines#Gears of Justice dispatch!}}

  == Design ==
  The "Geargia" archetype is primarily comprised of Level 3 "[[Geargiano (archetype)|Geargiano]]" monsters and Level 4 "Geargia" monsters. The archetype also features two Extra Deck Xyz Monsters that support the archetype.
  * The "Geargiano" monsters are cartoonified depictions of gearboxes, with gear-formed cartoon eyes and arms. Each of them also makes one of the rock-paper-scissors shapes with one of their hands.
  * The Level 4 "Geargia" monsters take the form of cartoon vehicles, each of which contains one "Geargiano" monster as its "driver".
  ** There are two sub-types of Level 4 "Geargia" monsters; 3 of them have effects that are trigged when they are flipped up, while the other 3 don't. Each sub-type contains one monster driven by one of the three "Geargiano" monsters.
  * The Extra Deck monsters take the form of large humanoid machines made out of cartoon gears, and contain multiple "Geargiano" monsters in them.

  == Playing style ==
  "Geargia" is a ramp-style Combo-Control or Control Deck, focusing on gaining [[advantage]] while swarming the field to summon Rank 3/4 Xyz monsters. Unlike a combo Deck, its main starters require a turn to set up; "[[Geargiarmor]]" needs to be flipped up, while "[[Geargiagear]]" is a Trap card. 

  A typical play is to set "Geargiarmor" along with various Traps on Turn 1, then combo off on the following turn (searching "[[Geargiaccelerator]]", make "[[Gear Gigant X]]", then search based on the variant).

  ! Card
  ! Description
  |-
  |[[Geargiarsenal]]
  |Can Tribute itself to Special Summon a "Geargia" monster from Deck.
  |-
  |[[Geargiarmor]]
  |When flipped face-up, searches a "Geargia" monster. Can flip itself down.
  |-
  |[[Geargiauger]]
  |Searches for a "Geargia" monster on Normal Summon, but locks the player into Machines.
  |-
  |[[Geargiaccelerator]]
  |Can Special Summon itself from hand if you control a "Geargia" monster, acting as the main extender. When sent from field to GY, adds a "Geargia" card from GY to hand.
  |-
  |[[Geargianchor]]<br>[[Geargiattacker]]
  |When flipped, "Geargianchor" can destroy monsters, and "Geargiattacker" can destroy Spells/Traps, both up to the number of other "Geargia" monsters you control. Both can flip themselves face-down.
  |-
  |[[Geargiano]]<br>[[Geargiano Mk-II]]<br>[[Geargiano Mk-III]]
  |All 3 "Geargiano" cards are Level 3 monsters.
  * The original "Geargiano" can Tribute itself to revive a Level 4 or lower Machine. 
  * "Mk-II", when Normal Summoned, can Special Summon a "Geargia" monster from hand/GY.
  * "Mk-III", when Special Summoned by a "Geargia" card, can Special Summon a "Geargia" monster from hand/GY.
  |-
  | [[Gear Gigant X]]
  | Searches any Level 4 or lower Machine on a soft once per turn. When it leaves the field, it can summon a Level 3 "Geargia" monster from the GY.
  |-
  | [[Geargiagear Gigant XG]]
  | The highest ATK monster in the Deck, can negate all cards during the Battle Step. When it leaves the field, it can add a "Geargia" card from GY to hand.
  |-
  | [[Geargia Change]]
  | Special Summons 2 or more "Geargia" monsters from the GY, then immediately performs an Xyz Summon with exclusiely them.
  |-
  | [[Geargiagear]]
  | Summons 2 Level 3 "Geargia" monsters, then optionally raises their Levels by 1.
  |}

  As an EARTH Machine archetype, it can mix with other archetypes such as "[[Karakuri]]" (whose position-changing effects can trigger "Geargiarmor" again) and "[[Machina]]". "Gear Gigant X" in particular can search for any Level 4 or lower Machine.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The Deck has not received support since 2016; it is simply too slow to compete with newer Decks.
  * "Geargia" monsters have relatively low [[ATK]], the highest being "[[Gear Gigant X]]" (2300 ATK) and "[[Geargiagear Gigant XG]]" (2500 ATK). This means that they can be beat over by common monsters like "[[Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack]]", "[[Evilswarm Ophion]]" and "[[Blaster, Dragon Ruler of Infernos]]".
  ** Using cards that alter monster's ATK, such as "[[Limiter Removal]]" and "[[Forbidden Lance]]" as well as using more powerful support monsters such as "[[Karakuri Shogun mdl 00 "Burei"]]" and "[[Karakuri Steel Shogun mdl 00X "Bureido"]]" can help with battling an opponent's monster(s).
  * "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" and "[[System Down]]" can easily clear the field of "Geargia" and supporting Machine monsters.
  * "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" shuts down all searching within the Deck. It can also negate the Special Summoning of Synchro and Xyz Monsters, which can ruin the win condition of "Geargia".
  * "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]" and other cards that prevent Special Summoning prevents nearly every "Geargia" monster from using their effects, as well as preventing them from Summoning monsters from their Extra Deck.
  * Since this Deck's strategy relies a lot on "[[Geargiarmor]]", negating its effect to search for a "Geargia" monster and set itself backdown can stop the Deck's momentum completely.
