  "'''Diabellstar'''" (ディアベルスター ''Diaberusutā'') is an [[archetype]] that debuted in ''[[Age of Overlord]]''.

  The archetype consists of "[[Diabellstar the Black Witch]]", the protagonist of the "Sinful Spoils" storyline, and her variations. This archetype and the "[[Sinful Spoils]]" archetype serve as support for each other, with "Diabellstar the Black Witch" searching "Sinful Spoils" Spell/Traps, which in turn have effects that work in conjunction with the "Diabellstar" monsters.
