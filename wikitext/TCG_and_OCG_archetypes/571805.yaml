  "'''G Golem'''" ({{Ruby|Ｇ|ジー}}ゴーレム ''Jī Gōremu'') is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[EARTH]] [[Cyberse]] monsters used by [[Earth (character)|Earth]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]'' anime. They were introduced in the ''[[OCG]]'' in ''[[Animation Chronicle 2022]]''.
  While it has never been officially confirmed what the "G" in "G Golem" stands for, the [[Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s Earth used suggest that it stands for "Gravity".

  == Design ==
  Each [[EARTH]] "G Golem" [[Link Monster]] is based on a type of [[wikipedia:Megalith|Megalithic]] construction, while the [[Effect Monster]]s are based on a type of earthen [[wikipedia:Mineral|mineral]]:

  == Playing style ==
  "G Golem" is an archetype centered on a [[Beatdown]]/[[Stall]] playstyle, focusing on quickly summoning its boss monster, “[[G Golem Invalid Dolmen]]” and establishing a continuous loop with it and “[[G Golem Crystal Heart]]” to slowly shave away at the opponent’s LP. "Invalid Dolmen" redirects all attacks to it and makes [[Co-linked|co-linked]] monsters unaffected by monster effects on the field, protecting “Crystal Heart” so as to revive it next turn, while also negating the effects of all of opponent's face-up cards permanently so as to eliminate dangerous threats. All the while, when “Crystal Heart” revives a monster, it gains a "[[GG Counter]]" which makes EARTH monsters co-linked to it come back stronger than before through gaining [[ATK]], the ability to attack twice, and inflict [[Piercing]] damage.
  The theme is also supported by a series of “Gravity” Spells and Traps that are designed to create stronger Link monsters, fortify defenses, and maintain the revival loop by protecting “Crystal Heart”. Currently the only card in this series printed is "[[Gravity Balance]]", which is also always treated as a "G Golem" card for accessibility.
