  ==Playing style==
  "Speedroids" focus on quickly swarming the field for fast [[Synchro Summon]]s. "[[Speedroid Terrortop]]" makes for a great opening move, as it can [[Special Summon]] itself from the hand while the player controls no monsters and can search for any "Speedroid" monster from the Deck, while also starting the deck's numerous combos. "[[Speedroid Marble Machine]]" can also search other "Speedroid" monsters (albeit with its Normal Summon). Both "Terrortop" and "Marble Machine" can then search for the following extenders to advance their Synchro Summon plans further. For example, "[[Speedroid Taketomborg|Taketomborg]]" can Special Summon itself from the hand freely (albeit the card can only be Special Summoned once per turn) as a non-Tuner, or Special Summon any "Speedroid" [[Tuner monster|Tuner]] from the Deck by Tributing itself. "[[Speedroid Double Yoyo]]" and "[[Speedroid Passinglider]]" can Special Summon more "Speedroid" monsters from the [[GY]] when Normal Summoned, which can be followed up with a Synchro Summon if a Tuner monster was Summoned, or another search if "Taketomborg" or "Terrotop" was Summoned. Their various Tuners also have useful effects, either for extension ("[[Speedroid Den-Den Daiko Duke]]" can Special Summon other "Speedroid" Tuners from the hand or GY, "[[Speedroid CarTurbo]]" freely Special Summon itself from the hand and "[[Speedroid Fuki-Modoshi Piper]]" can add one excavated card.), flexibility ("[[Speedroid Red-Eyed Dice|Red-Eyed Dice]]" changing other "Speedroid" monsters' levels and "[[Speedroid Maliciousmagnet|Maliciousmagnet]]" using an opponent's monster to Synchro Summon) or protection ("[[Speedroid Tri-Eyed Dice]]"). They also have several cards that can be activated by banishing themselves from the Graveyard for more usage, such as "[[Speedroid Horse Stilts|Horse Stilts]]", which can be set up with generic milling cards such as "[[Foolish Burial]]" or its archetype-specific solution "[[Speedroid Ultra Hound]]".

  The "Hi-Speedroid" Synchro Monsters have various effects. "[[Hi-Speedroid Hagoita]]" and "[[Hi-Speedroid Kendama]]" which can Special Summon themselves from the GY either by controlling a "Speedroid" Tuner or no monsters respectively (while "Kendama" can also burn the opoonent). "[[Hi-Speedroid Chanbara]]" which can attack twice, gaining a smal amount of ATK each time and add a banished "Speedroid" monster to the hand if sent to the GY, "[[Hi-Speedroid Puzzle]]" can recur a "Speedroid" monster from the GY at the end of the turn it is sent to the GY. "[[Hi-Speedroid Cork Shooter]]" can bring back its Synchro Materials or search a "Speedroid" Spell/Trap while "[[Hi-Speedroid Glider 2]]" can Summon back another WIND Synchro Monster, making them extremely useful [[Tuner Synchro Monster]]s for Summoning other powerful Synchro Monsters. "[[Hi-Speedroid Kitedrake]]" can nuke the entire field or negate the opponent's entire field and float into a "Speedroid" search upon its destruction. Finally, the level 11 "[[Hi-Speedroid Clear Wing Rider]]" can recycle WIND monsters, then selectively destroy cards on the opponent's field and gain ATK, then later Tribute itself to Summon two Level 7 WIND Synchro Monsters from the Extra Deck during the opponent's turn. From the aformentioned "Clear Wing Rider", "Speedroid" is intimately tied to the "[[Clear Wing]]" and "[[Synchro Dragon]]" archetypes for access to its main boss monsters, including: "[[Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]", "[[Clear Wing Fast Dragon]]", "[[Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon]]", "[[Crystal Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]" and "[[Crystal Clear Wing Over Synchro Dragon]]". In particular, "Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon" is the deck's central focus most of the time, due to its powerful negation effect and being easy to Summon in this deck. With the correct setup, the deck is capable of Summoning 2 or even 3 copies of "Crystal Wing" in one turn. With the advent of "Speedroid" and "Clear Wing" support introduced in ''[[Supreme Darkness]]'', they are able to facilitate the Summon of "Clear Wing Synchro Dragon" by "[[Speedroid Clackernel]]" placing "[[Speedroid Wing Synchron]]", then "Synchro Summon" said card while setting up their other effects.  Other than "Speedroid", "Clear Wing" and "Synchro Dragon" monsters, the WIND Synchro pool has plenty of powerful and versatile choices for the endboard of a "Speedroid" deck including high-level omni-negates such as "[[Baronne de Fleur]]" and "[[Cosmic Blazar Dragon]]".

  The archetype's Link Monster "[[Hi-Speedroid Rubber Band Shooter]]" effectively provides more utilities to the deck and further extend by randomly sending a "Speedroid" monster or adding one to the hand and also providing a much needed additional Normal Summon of a WIND monster. Some of the archetype's monster effects (such as "Taketomborg" or "Hagoita") limit the player to Special Summoning only WIND monsters during the turn their effects are used. Some of the aformentioned "Speedroid" cards depend on luck (mostly requiring [[die roll]]s) including the aformentioned "Hi-Speedroid Clear Wing Rider", "Speedroid Wheel" and "[[Re-dyce-cle]]".

  The archetype's Spell/Traps include "[[Speedroid Scratch]]" which can search any "Speedroid" monster, "[[Speedroid Wheel]]" which can Special Summon up to 2 "Speedroid" monsters from the Deck and "[[Speedroid Dupligate]]" can bounce any card on the field and can Special Summon itself as a Tuner once per Duel. Other supporting cards include "[[Speed Recovery]]", which can revive any "Speedroid" monster from the GY and can recur a "Speedroid" monster to the hand in the player's next turn. "[[Speedroid Clear Wing Wander]]" can destroy cards on the field then temporarily banish and return a WIND Synchro Monster on the field, allowing "Synchro Dragon" Synchro Monsters to re-use their negate effects once more. Both "Dupligate" and "Clear Wing Wander" having their secondary effects useable from the GY make them suitable choices for being sent to the GY with "Ultra Hound" or "[[Wing Synchron]]".

  This Deck can also make good use of [[Xyz Monster]]s, mainly Rank 3 Xyz Monsters with "Terrortop" and "Taketomborg". Because of the excellent synergy between "Terrortop" and "Taketomborg" providing bodies for a Rank 3 Xyz Summon without using a Normal Summon, those cards are often utilized in various strategies (mainly ones that are focused on Rank 3 Summons), including, but not limited to, "[[Burning Abyss]]" and "[[The Phantom Knights]]". However, it was also this synergy that ultimately led to "Terrortop" being [[Limited]] in both the ''OCG'' and ''TCG'' for a few years due to its over-usage in almost all decks, primarily "[[Zoodiac]]" and all of its variants during its prime. For "Speedroid" decks though, the pool of noteworthy WIND choices are not as plentiful as the Synchro choices but there are notable choices such as "[[Leviair the Sea Dragon]]", "[[Number 75: Bamboozling Gossip Shadow]]" and "[[Totem Bird]]".

  "Speedroid" Decks can benefit greatly with any generic WIND extenders outside of the archetype such as "[[Red Hared Hasty Horse]]" or "[[Tempest, Dragon Ruler of Storms]]" as they can help provide materials for Link Summoning "Hi-Speedroid Rubber Band Shooter" or Synchro Summoning. Fittingly considering their anime users, the "[[Windwitch]]" archetype can work well and intimately with this Deck, due to their similar swarming the field with WIND monsters for Synchro Summons and and are restricted into Summoning WIND Monsters for the turn.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Although "Speedroids" are an excellent [[swarm]]ing [[Deck]], the [[archetype]] itself is almost completely focused on the user, and their cards have somewhat low utility on their own, with very few cards that hinder the opponent substantially. Therefore, it is somewhat dependent on whatever monster(s) they Synchro Summoned in order to maintain both offense and defense on the field.
  * All of the Deck's strategies has various choke points that slow down its swarming capabilities which various "[[hand trap]]s" can provide when used at the right time: 
  ** The numerous searches that the Deck has (e.g. "[[Speedroid Terrortop]]", "[[Speedroid Marble Machine]]" and "[[Speedroid Scratch]]") can be foiled by "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]".
  ** "[[Hi-Speedroid Rubber Band Shooter]]" is a prime target to use with "[[Effect Veiler]]" or "[[Infinite Impermanence]]". Using the effect of "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" in response to the effect of "Hi-Speedroid Rubber Band Shooter" to search and send a "Speedroid" monster to the GY from the Deck.
  * The Deck relies heavily on having their cards in the Graveyard, which can be exploited through [[banishing]] cards before they can get to the GY such as "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]".
  * Because they are very dependent on Synchro Summons, they are also susceptible to anti-Special Summoning cards such as "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]", "[[Vanity's Fiend]]", and "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" or Extra Deck lockdown effects (such as "[[Dimensional Barrier]]", "[[Domain of the True Monarchs]]" or "[[Nekroz of Unicore]]") until their effect disappears.
