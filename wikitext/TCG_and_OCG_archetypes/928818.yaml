  "'''Counter'''" (カウンター ''Kauntā'') is an [[archetype]] whose first member was released in ''[[Labyrinth of Nightmare]]'', while its first support was introduced in ''[[Duelist Pack: Duelists of Explosion]]''.

  While most of its members are thematically unrelated, its [[Counter Trap]]s are supported by the effect of "[[Battlin' Boxer Uppercutter]]". Among these Counter Traps, some are direct support to the "[[Battlin' Boxer]]" archetype, and were used by [[Alito]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime.

  The "Counter" Counter Traps that support the "Battlin' Boxer" archetype have their name derived from the [[wikipedia:Counterpunch (boxing)|counterpunch]] boxing technique.
