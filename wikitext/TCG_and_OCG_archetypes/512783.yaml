  "'''Legendary Dragon'''" ({{Ruby|伝|でん}}{{ruby|説|せつ}}の{{Ruby|竜|りゅう}} ''Densetsu no Ryū'') is a theme of cards depicting the dragon forms of the "[[Legendary Knight]]s". In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime, they are a unique [[card type]] used by [[Yugi Muto]], [[Seto Kaiba]], and [[Joey Wheeler]] during the [[Waking the Dragons]] arc. In the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'', it is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card]]s which includes a [[name condition]] that causes them to always be treated as "Legendary Dragon" cards.

  "[[Legendary Dragon of White]]" is not a "Legendary Dragon" card because its Japanese name does not contain 「{{Ruby|伝説|でんせつ}}の{{Ruby|竜|りゅう}}」.

  ==Design==
  The names of the "Legendary Dragons" are derived from the trilogy of dialogues pertaining to the lost city of [[wikipedia:Atlantis|Atlantis]] written by the ancient philosopher [[wikipedia:Plato|Plato]]: ''[[wikipedia:Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]'', and ''[[wikipedia:Hermos (dialogue)|Hermos]]''. The specific body parts in their names correspond to where they were stabbed and sealed away by magic swords during the Battle of Atlantis in the anime.

  ==Appearances==
  ===''Yu-Gi-Oh!''===
  These cards first appeared in the [[Waking the Dragons]] arc of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime.

  [[Yugi Muto]], [[Joey Wheeler]], and [[Seto Kaiba]] each received one of the three Legendary Dragon cards: "[[The Eye of Timaeus]]", "[[The Claw of Hermos]]", and "[[The Fang of Critias]]", respectively. According to Kaiba, the Dragon he received, "Critias", seemed just as powerful as the [[Egyptian God Card]]s.

  These cards are the dragon forms of the three  [[Dartz]] transformed them into dragons to weaken them. The great ancient war ended in a draw, with the Dragons sealed away in their realm and the Leviathan severely weakened and diminished to a shadow.
  Although their names are known prior to their release in the dub anime, in the original anime, no one—not even the monsters—knows the names of these dragons except for their chosen Duelists, who learn their name upon releasing them, without even being told what their names are. Thus, they are referred to as the Nameless Dragons in the Japanese anime, sometimes even by their chosen Duelists.

  === Properties ===
  [[File:Legendary Dragons in Monster Card Zones.jpg|thumb|The Legendary Dragons being played in [[Monster Card Zone]]s in the anime]]
  In the anime, the "Legendary Dragon" cards have a unique card type; their cards are colored blueish, but not the same as [[Ritual Monster]]s. They can be played while "[[Spell Canceller (anime)|Spell Canceller]]" is on the [[field]], so they are not [[Spell Card]]s, unlike in the ''OCG''/''TCG''. They are usually played in [[Monster Card Zone]]s, but [[Yami Yugi]] placed the "[[The Eye of Timaeus (anime)|Eye of Timaeus]]" in a [[Spell & Trap Card Zone]] during his Duel with [[Weevil Underwood]].

  The "Eye of Timaeus" can fuse with other monsters to become new [[Fusion Monsters]]. [[Yami Yugi]] fused this card with "[[Dark Magician Girl (anime)|Dark Magician Girl]]" and "[[Dark Magician (anime)|Dark Magician]]" to form the respective [[Fusion Monster]]s: "[[Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight (anime)|Dark Magician Girl the Dragon Knight]]" and "[[Amulet Dragon (anime)|Amulet Dragon]]". He once attempted to fuse it with Weevil's "[[Poison Butterfly]]", but it did not work since at the time he had lost Timaeus's trust because he played "[[The Seal of Orichalcos (anime)|The Seal of Orichalcos]]" during his first Duel against [[Rafael]].

  The "[[Fang of Critias]]" can fuse with [[Trap Card]]s to form new Fusion Monsters with effects similar to the same Trap Cards he used. [[Seto Kaiba]] fused this card with "[[Crush Card Virus (later DM anime)|Crush Card Virus]]", "[[Tyrant Wing (anime)|Tyrant Wing]]", and "[[Mirror Force (anime)|Mirror Force]]" to form the respective [[Fusion Monsters]]: "[[Doom Virus Dragon (anime)|Doom Virus Dragon]]", "[[Tyrant Burst Dragon (anime)|Tyrant Burst Dragon]]", and "[[Mirror Force Dragon (anime)|Mirror Force Dragon]]".

  The "[[Claw of Hermos]]" can fuse with other monsters to form new [[Equip Spell Card]]s. Joey Wheeler fused this card with "[[Time Wizard (anime)|Time Wizard]]", "[[Red-Eyes B. Dragon (later anime)|Red-Eyes B. Dragon]]", "[[Rocket Warrior (anime)|Rocket Warrior]]", and "[[Big Bang Blow]]" to form the respective Equip Spells: "[[Time Magic Hammer (anime)|Time Magic Hammer]]", "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword (anime)|Red-Eyes Black Dragon Sword]]", "[[Rocket Hermos Cannon (anime)|Rocket Hermos Cannon]]", and "[[Big Bang Dragon Blow]]". In addition, Yami Yugi also fused "[[Queen's Knight (anime)|Queen's Knight]]" with the "Claw of Hermos" to form "[[Goddess Bow]]".

  "[[Legend of Heart (anime)|Legend of Heart]]" allows them to transform into their [[Legendary Knight]] forms: "[[Legendary Knight Timaeus (anime)|Legendary Knight Timaeus]]", "[[Legendary Knight Hermos (anime)|Legendary Knight Hermos]]", and "[[Legendary Knight Critias (anime)|Legendary Knight Critias]]". These three Legendary Knights, under the right conditions, can also be combined to form "[[Timaeus the Knight of Destiny (anime)|Timaeus the Knight of Destiny]]".

  In addition to the [[Spell Card]] "[[The Eye of Timaeus]]", [[Timaeus]] also possesses a [[Monster card|monster]] form based on his [[Dragon]] appearance: "[[Timaeus the United Dragon]]," and a [[Quick-Play Spell Card]] [[Counterpart]]: "[[The Gaze of Timaeus]]."

  === Legendary Knight ===
  {{main|Legendary Knight}}
  These are the true forms of the "Legendary Dragons". These knights were weakened by [[Dartz]] and were transformed into [[Dragon]]s, but they were eventually freed. Under the right circumstances, the three can combine to form "[[Timaeus the Knight of Destiny]]".

  In addition to Fusion Monsters formed using one of the "Legendary Dragon" cards and another card, "[[Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon]]" was originally formed with "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]" and "[[Tyrant Burst Dragon]]".

  == Playing style ==
  Each of the "Legendary Dragons" can [[Special Summon]] one of a number of [[Fusion Monster]]s by using another card. In the ''OCG''/''TCG'', only "[[The Eye of Timaeus]]" uses the other card as a [[Fusion Material]]; "[[The Fang of Critias]]" and "[[The Claw of Hermos]]" instead send the card to the Graveyard.
