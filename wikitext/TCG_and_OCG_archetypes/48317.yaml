  "'''Worm'''" (ワーム ''Wāmu'') is a large [[archetype]] of [[Monster Card|monsters]], the first support for which was introduced in ''[[Hidden Arsenal]]''. Unlike other archetypes, "Worm" cards are divided between two entirely distinct series of cards, only one of which has archetype support.
  The [[LIGHT]] [[Reptile]] "Worm" monsters were introduced as part of the early [[Duel Terminal]] sets. They are used by [[Callisto]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's World Championship 2009: Stardust Accelerator]]'' and have effects that support other [[Reptile]]-type Worm monsters.
  The [[Insect]] "Worm" monsters have effects that [[mill]] the opponent's Deck. They are used by [[Tetsu Trudge]] during his time as a [[Shadow Drone]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime.
  "[[Dimensionhole]]" ("Worm Hole" in Japanese) and "[[Electric Virus]]" are also "Worm" cards because they have 「ワーム」 in their Japanese names.
  ==Reptile Worms==
  These monsters primarily focus on [[Flip effect]]s. They were introduced in ''[[Duel Terminal - Synchro Awakening!!]]'' and even have their own set, ''[[Duel Terminal - Invasion of Worms!!]]''.
  Many of this archetype's [[Flip monster]]s generate [[hand advantage]] by allowing the player to draw extra cards or add extra cards to their hand, or create [[field advantage]] by destroying the opponent's cards. The non-Flip monsters allow the player to control the position of monsters on the field and flip the player's own monsters [[face-down]] or have their effects activated when cards are Set face-down in general. Some of its monsters also have battle oriented effects.
  ===Duel Terminal Story===
  {{See also|Master Guide 3 card storylines#File Number 01: Duel Terminal History (Original War)|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines#The "Worms" Appear|Master Duel card storylines#Alliance for Justice}}
  The storyline establishes that the "[[Ally of Justice]]" monsters were created specifically to combat the "Worms" (specifically the LIGHT Reptile "Worms") through a joint effort of 4 Duel Terminal clans. This is apparent through several crossover cards within the "Ally of Justice" series.
  Later on in the battle, captured Worms were converted into "A.O.J." monsters (i.e., "[[Ally of Justice Enemy Catcher]]"), which led to the "Mist Valley" clan falling out of favor with the other alliance members. They halted support for the "Ally of Justice" project and continued fighting the battle alone, though this decision was short-lived. The legendary "Dragunity" warriors returned to defend the Mist Valley, once their home, and joined forces with the clan taking up residence there. The greatest weapon of the "Worms" was "[[Worm Zero]]", which traded the threat of endless waves of "Worms" for the crushing presence of "Zero", whose arrival on the Duel Terminal world was enough to severely disturb time and space.

  ===Design===
  Visually, they resemble hideous alien creatures of a predominant single color, and often possess lipless toothy vertical mouths. However, they also incorporate biological features from real-world [[wikipedia:Worm|worms]], including transparent skin and external mucus.
  ===Members===
  Each one of the 26 ''[[Duel Terminal]]''-related "Worm" monsters possesses a name that starts with a different letter of the alphabet, ranging from "[[Worm Apocalypse|Apocalypse]]" (the weakest) to "[[Worm Zero|Zero]]" (the strongest).

  ===Playing style===
  Worms are one of the larger archetypes (in terms of number of members), but they currently have only 2 non-monster support cards: "[[Worm Call]]" and "[[W Nebula Meteorite]]". "W Nebula Meteor" can provide you with excellent draw power as well as the ability to use and recycle the Worm's flip effects. It is also the easiest method to Special Summon "[[Worm Victory]]", "[[Worm King]]", and "[[Worm Queen]]" from your Deck.
  "Worm Zero" potentially boasts the highest ATK of all "Worms" (with "Victory"), gaining 500 ATK for every Reptile Worm used for its fusion, and gains powerful effects determined by how many [[Fusion Material]]s were used.
  "[[Worm Queen]]", "[[Worm Cartaros]]", "[[Worm Xex]]" and "[[Worm Prince]]" have useful Deck thinning and monster searching effects.

  Whether making a control deck or a more standard beatdown deck, most decks built around this archetype use the effect of "[[W Nebula Meteorite]]" due to having several strong effects in one card. Any any time, it can activate all face-down [[Flip effect]] monsters while also flipping all of your opponent's monsters, allowing them to be revealed to the player and treated as face-up targets. Then, at the end of your turn, all your "Worm" flip effect monsters will be re-armed, you will draw a card for every "Worm" for potentially massive card advantage, while additionally summoning one of the archetype's high level monsters from the deck such as "[[Worm King]]" or "[[Worm Queen]]". Most also use the effect of "[[Worm Xex]]" to send to the graveyard, and then summon "[[Worm Yagan]]" through its own effect to gain further advantage, and to protect their cards until the end phase when using "[[W Nebula Meteorite]]" by using the flip effect of "[[Worm Yagan]]" to return an opponent's monster to the hand. This will also reset "[[Worm Yagan]]" and prevent it from being removed from play when it leaves the field. Finally, control oriented decks will often make use of and protect "[[Worm Linx]]" to draw 2 additional cards between each of their turns, one during each player's end phase, sometimes unintentionally decking out by not including ways to make use of the deck's drawing strength before the cards get discarded due to the [[Hand size limit]]. [[Polymerization]] can be used to make use of Worm monsters in hand, instant [[Spell Card]]s or cards with on-discard effects like [[Fabled]] monsters can all be used in one turn, and cards like "[[Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]" or even "[[XYZ-Dragon Cannon]]" can discard any number of cards to destroy or return to the hand 1 card on the field for each.

   or "Cartaros" along with this card can yield huge card advantage early on to make up for the Deck's relatively slow play. If you Summon "[[Worm Yagan]]" along with "Xex", you can activate "Nebula" on your opponent's turn, using "Yagan" to return one of their monsters to their hand. During the End Phase, you get to draw 1 card for each Reptile monster flipped face down by "Nebula" and can Special Summon a Level 7 or higher LIGHT Monster (notably "King", "Queen", or "Victory").

  ==Insect Worms==
  These monsters focus on milling the opponent's Deck. Visually, they resemble caterpillars and centipedes.
  ===List of Insect Worms===
  {{card query|[[Archseries::Worm]] [[Type::Insect]]|medium=official}}
  ===Playing style===
  Having Insect support cards like "[[Lair Wire]]" while also having "[[Doom Dozer]]" and "[[Aztekipede, the Worm Warrior]]" in your Deck means you will rely heavily on having Insect monsters in your Graveyard which you can remove from play. Therefore, it would be a good idea to use cards that mill both players to steadily replenish your Graveyard's stock of Insect monsters. Cards like "[[D.D.R. - Different Dimension Reincarnation]]" can be used to bring back monsters like "Shield Worm" and "Warm Worm" in late game to force your opponent to send away even more cards.
  Searchers like "Howling Insect" and "Gokipon" can be of great use as well by populating your Graveyard while getting more monsters to the field and your hand. 
  This Deck concentrates on using "[[Warm Worm]]", "[[Needle Worm]]" and "[[Shield Worm]]" to mill your opponent's Deck. "[[Chainsaw Insect]]" is used for a beatstick and to force your opponent to draw. "Doom Dozer" and "Aztekipede" can be used with "[[Robbin' Zombie]]" to send more cards from the Deck to the Graveyard. "[[Assault on GHQ]]" can be used on the used up "Needle Worm" or on a "Warm Worm".
