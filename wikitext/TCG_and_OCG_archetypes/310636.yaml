  "'''Deskbot'''", known as "'''Bunborg'''" (ブンボーグ ''Bunbōgu'') in the Japanese version, is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with 500 [[ATK]] and [[DEF]]. They are one of each [[Level]]ed monsters that [[support]] Machine monsters in general, with a [[swarm]] strategy and [[Monster effect|effects]] that increase their ATK and DEF. They are used by [[Tate]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime.

  == Design ==
  Each "Deskbot" monster is based on school supplies. They wear them as their armor or use them as weapons. The Japanese name of the archetype, ブンボーグ (''Bunbōgu''), is based on a pun that blends the homophonous word 文房具 (''bunbōgu'' "office supplies; stationery") and the English loanword サイボーグ (''saibōgu'' "cyborg").

  == Playing style ==
  As mentioned above, "Deskbot" monsters can easily swarm and boost ATK and DEF. For example, "[[Deskbot 001]]" boosts its own ATK and DEF and can Special Summon itself from the Graveyard, while "[[Deskbot 002|002]]" boosts your other Machine monsters' ATK and DEF, and can add "Deskbot" cards from the deck to the hand. "[[Deskbot 003|003]]" can Special Summon a "Deskbot" from the Deck upon being Normal Summoned, and can grant a boost to a "Deskbot's" ATK and DEF once every turn. "[[Deskbot 004|004]]" can gain ATK and DEF when it battles while also thinning the Deck and then possibly swarming the Field. Lastly, "[[Deskbot 009|009]]" gains the ATK of all other "Deskbots" on the field, prevents your opponent from activating effects while it is attacking, and can even sacrifice another "Deskbot" to protect itself from being destroyed.
  "[[Deskbot 005|Deskbots 005]]," "[[Deskbot 006|006]]," "[[Deskbot 007|007]]" and "[[Deskbot 008|008]]" are all [[Pendulum Monster]]s whose Pendulum Effects restrict the [[Pendulum Summon]] to "Deskbot" monsters. "005" and "006" gain ATK for every face-up "Deskbot" in the Extra Deck, and can activate their effects when they are destroyed in the Pendulum Zone, either Special Summoning "Deskbots" from the Graveyard or adding them to your hand, respectively.  "007" and "008" gain ATK for every "Deskbot" in the Graveyard, can protect your other "Deskbots" from either attacks or card effects, and can either deal piercing damage or attack twice every turn.
  Finally, the ace of the archetype, "[[Deskbot Jet]]", boosts its own ATK and DEF for every "Deskbot" card on the field, and every turn can destroy a "Deskbot" to either Special Summon another one from the Deck, or destroy another card on the field.
  With all this in mind, it's clear that the "Deskbot" strategy is geared toward large swarms leading to [[OTK]]s. They can make use of excellent Machine support cards like "[[Machine Duplication]]" and "[[Limiter Removal]]", as well as other swarm cards like "[[Inferno Reckless Summon]]" and other ATK-boosters.
  Due to the swarming ability of the theme, in a mid game it is pretty easy to have a Field and Graveyard full of "Deskbots", which can set up the game to "[[Deskbot Base]]": by banishing 9 different "Deskbots" from the Field and/or Graveyard, it shuffles all cards in the opponent's possession back to the Deck, except the banished ones, and can pave the way for a game-winning direct attack.
