  "'''Branded'''" ({{Ruby|烙|らく}}{{Ruby|印|いん}} ''Rakuin'') is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Lightning Overdrive]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX card storylines#No. 01: The Closed Land|The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines#No. 01: The Land of the Abyss|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 01: The Decisive Battle of the Northern Land|Story of White card storylines}}

  == Design ==
  Similar to "[[World Legacy]]" throughout [[Series 10]], the "Branded" cards serve as a connecting narrative thread between many of the themes introduced throughout [[Series 11]] that are part of the [[The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines|Abyss storyline]] (such as "[[Dogmatika]]" and "[[Despia]]"), and detail major plot developments through their artworks.

  == Playing style ==
  {{For|the playing style, etymology, and other information|Despia|}}

  "Branded" is an archetype of primarily [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s that support various cards related to "[[Fallen of Albaz]]" and Fusion Summoning. It also directly supports the "[[Despia]]" and "[[Bystial]]" archetypes:

  * Despia: "Branded Despia", also known as just "Branded", is a Fusion-based decktype that uses the "Branded" cards as playmakers, with the "Albaz" Fusion Monsters forming the Deck's primary resource loop. Cards in either archetype can search each other out.
  * Bystial: The "Bystials" are generally supported by the "Branded" [[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous Spells]] and [[Continuous Trap Card|Continuous Traps]]. "[[The Bystial Lubellion]]" and "[[Branded Beast]]" can place such cards directly from the Deck or GY respectively.

  The primary ways of searching "Branded" Spell and Traps are "[[Aluber the Jester of Despia]]", "[[Springans Kitt]]" and "[[Albion the Branded Dragon]]". They can also be 'searched' by sending them to the GY via cards like "[[Albion the Shrouded Dragon]]" and "[[Bystial Saronir]]", then recovering them with "[[Branded Retribution]]" or "[[Despian Tragedy]]".

  Each of the "Branded" Spells & Traps that debuted in ''[[Lightning Overdrive]]'' share an effect to Set themselves to the [[field]] at the [[End Phase]] if it is sent to the GY to activate the effect of "Fallen of Albaz". Similarly, other "Branded" Spells and Traps can recur themselves back to the hand when a Fusion Monster is sent to the GY (eg. "[[Branded in High Spirits]]" and "[[Brightest, Blazing, Branded King]]").

  Finally, "[[Branded in Central Dogmatika]]" supports the Ritual-centric portion of "[[Dogmatika]]".
