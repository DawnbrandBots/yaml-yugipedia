  {{Quote|Prophecy says that this world was created by an ancient Dragon, who now seeks a successor! This fight for the future has led Dinosaur, Sea Serpent, and Wyrm monsters to compete in a no-mercy battle to the finish. The victor will ascend into a new Dragon that will create and rule the next world. But you can put all three of them together by building a Ryu-Ge Deck! Connect their realms and seek out who becomes the victorious Dragon of your Deck!

  "'''Ryu-Ge'''" ({{Ruby|竜|りゅう}}{{Ruby|華|げ}} ''Ryūge'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]] 10 [[monster]]s introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Crossover Breakers]]''/''[[Crossover Breakers]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The archetype's name is a reference to ''Ryūgesan-e'' (竜華三会 lit. "Dragon Flower Three Sermons"). It is prophesized that [[wikipedia:Maitreya|Maitreya]], the future Buddha, will achieve enlightenment beneath the "Dragon Flower Tree", a tree whose branches are said to resemble dragons. After attaining Buddhahood, Maitreya will then preach three sermons for the salvation of all living things. There are three "Ryu-Ge Realm" [[Continuous Spell Card]]s, whose artworks appear to depict similar sermons led by the archetype's members for the monsters of their respective [[Type]].

  It may also be a portmanteau of ''ryū'' (竜 "dragon") and ''shōka'' (昇華 "sublimation; ascension"), referring to the archetype's lore of its non-Dragon members being dragon-like monsters competing to determine which will ascend to true dragonhood.

  The Japanese names of the "Ryu-Ge Realm" cards each take the form 「登竜華○○門」 (''Toryūge [...]mon'', "Rising Ryu-Ge [...] Gate"). This is likely a reference to the legend of ''[[wikipedia:Longmen (mythology)|Longmen]]'' (登龍門 ''Toryūmon'', lit. "rising dragon gate"), which states that carp that are able to swim up the Yellow River and jump over the Dragon Gate will become dragons, again referring to the archetype's lore of its non-Dragon members competing for ascension to true dragonhood.

  === Members ===
  Except for "[[Sosei Ryu-Ge Mistva]]", each member has a different [[Type]] that includes the dragon kanji in its Japanese name. This represents their statuses as lesser dragon-like monsters, as opposed to true [[Dragon]] monsters like "Mistva". Their [[Attribute]]s are also associated with the Type and reflected in the monsters' color scheme being dominated by a primary color.

  Each member has a title linking them to their respective "Ryu-Ge Realm", which is a corruption of their Japanese Type name; the dragon kanji is replaced with a different kanji that uses the dragon character as a phonetic component.

  == Playing style ==
  "Ryu-Ge" is a [[Level 10]]-focused theme revolving around the [[Summon]]ing of the three main monsters, as well as the activation of their respective [[Continuous Spell]]s to grant benefits to the monsters and Summon their boss monster.

  Individually, each monster was designed to synergize with the main thematic playing styles associated with the respective Types:
  * "[[Kyoro Ryu-Ge Kaiva]]" can [[Special Summon]] itself from the [[hand]] if 2 or more cards were [[destroy]]ed during the current turn and destroy cards on the field (including the player's own monsters) as an [[Ignition Effect]] while the player control it, thus synergizing with [[Transcendosaurus]] monsters and generic [[Dinosaur]] support cards like "[[Ground Xeno]]", "[[Babycerasaurus]]", and "[[Petiteranodon]]".
  * "[[Kairo Ryu-Ge Emva]]" can Special Summon itself from the [[Graveyard]] if 2 or more monsters were [[sent]] from the hand and/or Deck to the GY during the current turn, thus synergizing with [[Sea Serpent]] archetypes like "[[Mermail]]" and "[[Atlantean]]", and its effect to [[banish]] the opponent's entire hand fits with [[List of unofficial terms|hand disruption]] provided by cards like "[[Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord]]" and "[[Deep Sea Minstrel]]".
  * "[[Genro Ryu-Ge Hakva]]" can Special Summon itself from the banishment if a monster is banished face-up while there are 2 or more banished monsters, thus synergizing with [[Wyrm]] archetypes like "[[Metaphys]]", "[[Swordsoul]]", and "[[Tenyi]]", which are focused on banishing their own cards.
  * Finally, although not synergizing with any particular [[Dragon]] theme, "[[Sosei Ryu-Ge Mistva]]" is amazingly fitting in "[[Voiceless Voice]]", an archetype entirely focused on [[Ritual Summon]]ing [[LIGHT]] monsters.
  Because of this, each monster can be played separately in pair with the respective Continuous Spell Card as a small yet powerful engine.
