  "'''Ryu-Ge'''" ({{Ruby|竜|りゅう}}{{Ruby|華|げ}} ''Ryūge'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]] 10 [[monster]]s introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Crossover Breakers]]''/''[[Crossover Breakers]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The archetype's name is a portmanteau of ''ryū'' (竜 "dragon") and ''shōka'' (昇華 "sublimation; ascension"), referring to the ascension of dragon-like monsters into dragons.

  It is also a reference to ''Ryūgesan-e'' (竜華三会 lit. "Dragon Flower Three Sermons"). It is prophesized that [[wikipedia:Maitreya|Maitreya]], the future Buddha, will achieve enlightenment beneath the "Dragon Flower Tree", a tree whose branches are said to resemble dragons. After attaining Buddhahood, Maitreya will then preach three sermons for the salvation of all living things. The artworks of the "Ryu-Ge" [[Continuous Spell Card]]s appear to depict similar sermons led by the archetype's members for the monsters of their respective [[Type]].

  === Members ===
  Except for "[[Guangba, Luminous Ryu-Ge of Starforge]]", each member has a different [[Type]] that includes the dragon kanji in its Japanese name. This represents their statuses as lesser dragon-like monsters, as opposed to true [[Dragon]] monsters like "Guangba". Their [[Attribute]]s are also associated with the Type and reflected in the monsters' color scheme being dominated by a primary color.

  == Playing style ==
  "Ryu-Ge" is a [[Level 10]]-focused theme revolving around the [[Summon]]ing of the three main monsters, as well as the activation of their respective [[Continuous Spell]]s to grant benefits to the monsters and Summon their boss monster.

  Individually, each monster was designed to synergize with the main thematic playing styles associated with the respective Types:
  * "[[Kuaiba, Rugged Ryu-Ge of Dinocrag]]" can [[Special Summon]] itself from the [[hand]] if 2 or more cards were [[destroy]]ed during the current turn and destroy cards on the field (including the player's own monsters) as an [[Ignition Effect]] while the player control it, thus synergizing with [[Transcendosaurus]] monsters and generic [[Dinosaur]] support cards like "[[Ground Xeno]]", "[[Babycerasaurus]]", and "[[Petiteranodon]]".
  * "[[Yuanba, Abyssal Ryu-Ge of Serpentfall]]" can Special Summon itself from the [[Graveyard]] if 2 or more monsters were [[sent]] from the hand and/or Deck to the GY during the current turn, thus synergizing with [[Sea Serpent]] archetypes like "[[Mermail]]" and "[[Atlantean]]", and its effect to [[banish]] the opponent's entire hand fits with [[List of unofficial terms|hand disruption]] provided by cards like "[[Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord]]" and "[[Deep Sea Minstrel]]".
  * "[[Baba, Champion Ryu-Ge of Wyrmhaze]]" can Special Summon itself from the banishment if a monster is banished face-up while there are 2 or more banished monsters, thus synergizing with [[Wyrm]] archetypes like "[[Swordsoul]]" and "[[Tenyi]]", both focused on banishing their owns cards.
  * Finally, although not synergizing with any particular [[Dragon]] theme, "[[Guangba, Luminous Ryu-Ge of Starforge]]" is amazingly fitting in "[[Voiceless Voice]]", an archetype entirely focused on [[Ritual Summon]]ing [[LIGHT]] monsters.
  Because of this, each monster can be played separately in pair with the respective Continuous Spell Card as a small yet powerful engine.
