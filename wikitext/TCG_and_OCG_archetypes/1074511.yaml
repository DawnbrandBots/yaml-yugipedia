  "'''Apodrakosis'''" ({{Ruby|竜|りゅう}}{{Ruby|華|げ}} ''Ryūge'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]] 10 [[monster]]s introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Crossover Breakers]]''/''[[Crossover Breakers]]''.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  The archetype's Japanese name ({{Ruby|竜|りゅう}}{{Ruby|華|げ}} ''Ryūge'') is a portmanteau of ''ryū'' (竜, lit. "dragon") and ''shōka'' (昇華, lit. "sublimation; ascension"), referring to the ascension of dragon-like monsters into dragons.

  ''Ryūge'' is also a reference to ''Ryūgesan-e'' (竜華三会, lit. "Dragon Flower Three Sermons"). It is prophesized that [[wikipedia:Maitreya|Maitreya]], the future Buddha, will achieve enlightenment beneath the "Dragon Flower Tree", a tree whose branches are said to resemble dragons. After attaining Buddhahood, Maitreya will then preach three sermons for the salvation of all living things. The artworks of the "Apodrakosis" [[Continuous Spell Card]]s depict similar "sermons" led by the archetype's members for the monsters of their respective [[Type]].

  "Apodrakosis" is a portmanteau of "[[wikipedia:Apotheosis|apotheosis]]", the glorification of a subject to the level of the divine, and ''drákōn'' ([[wiktionary:δράκων|δράκων]]), the Ancient Greek word for "dragon".

  ===Members===
  Except for "[[Guangba, Luminous Apodrakosis of Starforge]]", each member is of a different [[Type]] that includes the kanji ''ryū'' (竜, lit. "dragon") in the Type's Japanese name. This represents their statuses as lesser dragon-like monsters, as opposed to true [[Dragon]] monsters like "Guangba".
