  "'''Mulcharmy'''" (マルチャミー ''Maruchamī'') is an archetype of [[Level]] 4 monsters with 100 [[ATK]] and 600 [[DEF]] introduced in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]''. It does not have true [[support]]—instead, the "Mulcharmy" monsters prevent the player from using the effects of "Mulcharmy" monsters more than twice per turn.

  == Design ==
  The name "Mulcharmy" seems to be a pun of "multiply" and "charming", in reference to the members' ability to enlarge the player's hand and their cutesy appearance. Each of them is designed to resemble a creature associated to the element of its [[Attribute]], and is named after a Japanese onomatopeia associated with that creature. As seen in each of their concept artworks, the "Mulcharmy" monsters are depicted as a swarm showing the various stages of their life cycle, with the "adult" form being in the foreground of the card artwork.

  All "Mulcharmy" monsters have almost identical effects: They can [[discard]] themselves during either player's turn as a [[Quick Effect]] if their owner controls no cards. Then for the rest of the turn, the player draws 1 card every time their opponent [[Summon]]s a monster from a certain location (similar to "[[Maxx "C"]]"), but if their hand size exceeds the number of cards the opponent controls by more than 6 at the end of that turn, the player must shuffle back random cards from their hand until they reach that threshold. The monsters only differ in the locations (and Summoning method, in the case of "Purulia") that they count Summons from. When a "Mulcharmy" monster activates its effect in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel]]'', swarms of the featured monster surround the areas that their effects apply to until the end of the turn.
