  "'''Madolche'''" (マドルチェ ''Madoruche'', pronounced as "mah-DOL-chay"<ref>https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=4152</ref>) is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with various [[Type]]s.

  == Etymology ==
  "Madolche" is a combination of the words "magical" ("madō" in Japanese), "doll", and "dolce" (pronounced "dol-chay"), the Italian word for "sweet" or "dessert".

  == Design ==
  All "Madolche" monsters appear as cutesy dessert-themed characters standing on various sweets in the shape of a jigsaw puzzle piece. On close inspection,  the limbs of all the "Madolche" monsters show what appear to be sewing seams, implying that all the characters are dolls or plushies. This is supported by the artwork of "[[Madolche Nights]]" showing the "Madolche" monsters as dolls in a room.

  == Members ==
  The names of the "Madolche" are portmanteaus of desserts, and titles or animal sounds, depending on the monster's [[Type]].

  === Fairy ===
  The [[Fairy]] monsters are the royalty, and thus have royalty-based portmanteaus.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Madolche" monsters focus on recycling their cards for repeated use, with all of the "Madolche" monsters being sent either back to the [[Deck]] or to the [[hand]] after being [[destroy]]ed by an opponent. Several of those monsters have effects that send "Madolche"-specific [[Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s from the Graveyard back to the Deck, or from the Deck to your hand. This makes the "Madolche" very difficult to [[Deck Out]], a strategy almost entirely opposite to many other contemporary archetypes.
  While the Deck does not do any [[Deck Thinning|Deck thinning]] on its own, it does however feature a wide variety of [[searcher]]s, making the Deck highly stable. "[[Madolche Butlerusk]]" is capable of scanning the Deck for a [[Field Spell Card|field spell]], which is mostly exclusively used for "[[Madolche Chateau]]". "[[Madolche Messengelato]]" can search for any "Madolche" Spell or Trap Card, allowing easy access to many support cards. "[[Madolche Magileine]]" and "[[Madolche Ticket]]" are easily capable of searching for other monsters from the Deck, and "[[Madolche Marmalmaide]]" can recycle Spells and Traps, which are likely the only cards that will stay in the Graveyard.
  The ultimate goal of most "Madolche" Decks is to maintain card advantage and take advantage of openings to quickly deal damage. The main powerhouse cards used are "[[Madolche Puddingcess]]" and "[[Madolche Queen Tiaramisu]]"; they have relatively high [[ATK]] (so long as the effect of "Puddingcess" requirement of the [[Graveyard]] being empty is met) and powerful effects to deplete the opponents' field presence, clearing the way for the weaker monsters to attack directly. Out of the two, "Queen Tiaramisu" is more prominently used as the Deck's boss monster, as it not only features a massive ATK stat, but it also possesses the ability to eliminate targets on the opposing field by returning cards to the Deck. This is particularly effective because "Queen Tiaramisu" has an effect that does not target, making responding to this effect very difficult to do in most scenarios.
  The "Madolche" are also in possession of an effect damage [[Infinite loop|loop]] that abuses the effects of "[[Madolche Waltz]]", "Chateau" and "[[Desperate Tag]]". While those three cards are active and the player controls at least two of the Warrior "Madolche", they can use "Desperate Tag" to continuously attack a more powerful opponent, cause 300 damage with "Waltz", [[Special Summon]] a new Warrior, and return the old one to the hand. "Messengelato" is preferable for this so long as you also have a Beast on the field, since each time it is Special Summoned you can add one of the "Madolche" Spell or Trap Cards to your hand, further increasing your hand and field advantage. "[[Madolche Chouxvalier]]" works fine as well, since his effect prevents your other "Madolche" monsters from being targeted for attacks. If you have "[[Madolche Ticket]]" and a Fairy "Madolche" monster, you can Special Summon another Warrior "Madolche" monster in addition to this loop. For "Messengelato", as long as this loop happens in your Battle Phase, you can use it's effect again and again.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The biggest weakness of the archetype is its reliance on its monster effects to create combos; cards efficient at negating them are a serious threat to most "Madolche" Decks. Hand traps like "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" or "[[Effect Veiler]]" can negate the monster effects that summon additional Madolche cards.
  * Cards that can limit a player's ability to search, like "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]", "[[Drop Off]]" or "[[Drastic Drop Off]]" can severely hinder a "Madolche" player's ability to gather resources. "Rai-Oh" can also block the Summoning of "Tiaramisu" and send all the monsters involved to the Graveyard, and no other "Madolche" is strong enough to destroy "Rai-Oh" without help.
  * Cards like "[[Macro Cosmos]]", "[[Banisher of the Light]]", "[[Divine Knight Ishzark]]" and "[[Transmigration Break]]" will prevent any "Madolche" cards from being sent to the Graveyard at all, preventing not only their own effects, but keeping "Tiaramisu" from having any valid targets in the Grave.
  ** Similarly, "[[Necrovalley]]" will keep cards moving out of the GY, which is essential for its strategy.
  * The recycle effect of "Madolche" monsters are only limited to Main Deck ones, not the Extra Deck ones. It can also be a double-edged sword since it can hinder the use of "Tiaramisu" and "Hootcake". Not to mention the effect can ''only'' be triggered when destroyed under the owner's possession, any other removal methods will not trigger such effect.
  * "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" or a "[[Kycoo the Ghost Destroyer]]" controlled by your opponent will easily shut down "Hootcake" and any Psychic "Madolche" builds, slowing progress to a crawl until those obstacles can be overcome.
