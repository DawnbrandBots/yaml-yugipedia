  "'''Junk'''" (ジャンク ''Janku'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Machine]] and [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] primarily used by [[Yusei Fudo]] and [[Bashford]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]''.

  Starting in ''[[Structure Deck: Power of Fellows]]'', the archetype also gained a sub-series based around "[[Junk Warrior]]" and cards that mention it.

  == Playing style ==
  "Junk" [[Monster Card|monsters]] focus on utilizing lower [[Level]] monsters to [[Synchro Summon]] powerful [[Synchro Monster]]s. All "Junk" Synchro Monsters, with the exception of "[[Junk Speeder]]", require the use of "[[Junk Synchron]]" as their [[Tuner monster]], so Summoning it is critical to its playing style. These Synchro Monsters have varied Levels from 5 to 8, allowing the archetype to be adaptable and use any monster with a Level between 2 and 5 alongside "Junk Synchron" as [[Synchro Material]] for their Synchro Summons. To facilitate this, a few [[Main Deck]] "Junk" monsters have effects to [[Special Summon]] themselves or other monsters, like "[[Junk Forward]]" and "[[Junk Servant]]", and "Junk Synchron" itself can Special Summon a Level 2 or lower monster from the [[Graveyard|GY]]. "[[Junk Anchor]]" is also useful for its ability to Special Summon another monster and [[Substitutes for Synchro Material|substitute]] itself for "Junk Synchron" in a Synchro Summon. Finally, "[[Junk Converter]]" can discard itself to search "Junk Synchron" and thus Special Summoned with the latter, and then can Special Summon a Tuner monster to continue Synchro Summoning.

  A "Junk" Deck also appreciates the use of other effects to Special Summon monsters. "[[Level Warrior]]" and "[[Quillbolt Hedgehog]]" Special Summon themselves from the hand and GY respectively, making it easier to Synchro Summon higher Level monsters. "[[Doppelwarrior]]" can Special Summon itself when "Junk Synchron" uses its effect, increasing flexibility further as it means the latter can Special Summon a Tuner monster to take advantage of the former's "[[Doppel Token]]s". This also helps increase the number of cards "[[Junk Destroyer]]" can destroy with its effect: "Doppelwarrior" and the Summoned Tuner can be used as material for a Level 3 or 4 Synchro Monster, then the Tokens and the Synchro Monster can be used as material for "Junk Destroyer", destroying up to 3 cards on the field if a Level 1 Tuner was Summoned. "Doppelwarrior" cannot be used with "Junk Anchor", however, as it will [[If... You Can VS When... You Can|miss the timing]].

  === Weaknesses ===
  While fast and very proficient in swarming the field, "Junk" monsters often lack raw attack power, requiring them to rely on Synchro Monsters to gain an advantage. As such, cards that negate effects can prevent the effects of "Junk Synchron" and "Junk Anchor" can make it difficult to Summon such monsters, and cards that prevent Synchro Summons entirely, such as "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" or "[[Discord]]", severely restrict the Deck.
