  "'''Familiar-Possessed'''", known as "'''Possession-Equipped'''" ({{Ruby|憑|ひょう}}{{Ruby|依|い}}{{Ruby|装|そう}}{{Ruby|着|ちゃく}} ''Hyōisōchaku'') in the Japanese version, is an [[archetype]] of [[Spellcaster]] [[Effect Monster]]s with 1850 [[ATK]]. It is a sub-[[archetype]] of the "[[Possessed]]" archetype.
  There is one Main Deck "Familiar-Possessed" monster for each of the six main [[Attribute]]s, as well as one [[Link Monster]] for each of those six Attributes. The Main Deck "Familiar-Possessed" monsters each have an [[effect]] that allows it to be [[Special Summon]]ed from the [[hand]] or Deck by [[send]]ing one "[[Charmer]]" monster and one other monster, both of the same Attribute as the "Familiar-Possessed" monster, from the player's [[field]] to the [[Graveyard]], and when Summoned in this way, gives the "Familiar-Possessed" monster a [[piercing]] effect.

  As the name suggests, each "Familiar-Possessed" monster features a familiar, a more fierce-looking version of a Level 1 or 2 monster with the same Attribute as the "Familiar-Possessed" monster. In the alternate artworks, the familiars are shown merged with the respective "Charmers" in various ways, making the name more fitting.

  == History ==
  Originally, there were only four "Familiar-Possessed" monsters, released in ''[[Elemental Energy]]'' (one for each elemental Attribute of [[FIRE]], [[WATER]], [[WIND]], and [[EARTH]]), until the [[DARK]] "Familiar-Possessed" monster was released in ''[[Order of Chaos]]'' and the LIGHT "Familiar-Possessed" monster was released in ''[[Maximum Crisis]]''. The "Familiar-Possessed" monsters are more advanced versions of the "Charmer" monsters, similar to the [[Cataclysmic Charmer]]s and the [[Spiritual Art]]s.
  Later, [[retrained]] [[Link Monster]] counterparts of the "Familiar-Possessed" monsters were
  all released.
