  "'''Majespecter'''" (マジェスペクター ''Majesupekutā'') is an [[archetype]] of [[WIND]] [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] debuting in ''[[Dimension of Chaos]]''. This archetype is connected to the "[[Igknight]]s" and "[[Dinomist]]s" through the "[[Dracoslayer]]" archetype: they are full-Pendulum archetypes containing a "Dracoslayer" monster (which appears to be a merging of one of its archetype members with another mystic creature) and Field Spell Cards portraying the surging of those monsters. The "Dracoslayer" monsters and Field Spell Card contain a word with "P", written as "P" with a Furigana, just like how "Pendulum" is written "P" with the Furigana "Pendyuramu". While the "Dinomist" archetype consists of Effect monsters with Pendulum effects and the "Igknight" archetype consists of Normal Monsters (no monster effect) that all have Pendulum effects, the "Majespecter" archetype consists almost entirely of effect monsters with no Pendulum effects. Three monsters representing the non-"Luster Pendulum" half of the "Dracoslayer" monsters were released in [[Darkwing Blast]], as well.

  == Etymology ==
  "Majespecter" appears to be a portmanteau of "Majestic" and "Specter".

  == Playing style ==
  "Majespecter" is a [[Pendulum Monster]]-based archetype with a [[Control Strategy|control]] playstyle revolving around [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s. Most "Majespecter" Main Deck monsters [[Cannot be targeted by card effects|cannot be targeted]] or [[Cannot be destroyed by card effects|destroyed by the opponent's card effects]], granting them a high level of base protection. Most of them also generate advantage upon being Summoned:

  * "[[Majespecter Raccoon - Bunbuku|Raccoon]]" searches "Majespecter" monsters
  * "[[Majespecter Crow - Yata|Crow]]" searches "Majespecter" Spells
  * "[[Majespecter Fox - Kyubi|Fox]]" searches "Majespecter" Traps
  * "[[Majespecter Toad - Ogama|Toad]]" searches "Majespecter" Spell/Traps
  * "[[Majespecter Cat - Nekomata|Cat]]" searches any "Majespecter" card in End Phase
  * "[[Majespecter Porcupine - Yamarashi|Porcupine]]" recovers a "Majespecter" Spell from GY.
  * "[[Majesty Pegasus, the Dracoslayer]]" searches any [[Field Spell]] when Pendulum Summoned.

  "Majespecter" and its supporting Spell/Traps have various beneficial effects, usually requiring the Tributing a WIND Spellcaster monster.
  * "[[Majespecter Cyclone|Cyclone]]", "[[Majespecter Storm|Storm]]", "[[Majespecter Tornado|Tornado]]", and "[[Majespecter Tempest|Tempest]]" remove enemy monsters, and are the Deck's main field control options.
  * "[[Majespecter Wind|Wind]]" is both a monster recovery option and a summon-from-deck combo starter.
  * "[[Majesty's Pegasus]]", which is only searchable by "[[Majesty Pegasus, the Dracoslayer]]", provides more summon-from-deck searching and stat boosting

  Other "Majespecter" Spell/Traps only have situational and/or highly conditional utility.

  The deck's main combo makers are the follows:
  * [[Starter]]: "[[Majespecter Raccoon - Bunbuku]]" (searches "Porcupine")
  * [[Extender]]: "[[Majespecter Porcupine - Yamarashi]]"
  * Extra Deck [[Enabler|combo enabler]]: "[[Majespecter Orthrus - Nue]]" (searches and recovers a large amount of "Majespecter" monsters, and sets up Link Arrows for Pendulum Summoning, but [[xenolock]]s the player)

  The ace monster of the archetype, "Kirin", which acts as the deck's control measure, can return both an opponent's monster and a Pendulum Monster you control to the hand (including itself) as a Quick Effect. Although it's a Level 6 monster, putting it out of range of the archetype's Pendulum Scale of 2 and 5, it can now be easily brought out with the new Xyz Pendulum Monster "Draco", which also debuted in ''Phantom Nightmare''.

  Externally, the archetype synergizes with other control-focused Pendulum cards, such as "[[Archfiend Eccentrick]]", which provides high Pendulum Scale (that works with "Kirin") and removal.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "Majespecter" monsters have low stats, and is thus weak to high-ATK monster swarming.
  * As a Pendulum and Spell/Trap-based Deck, the deck is weak to anti-Spell/Trap effects and floodgates. (e.g. "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]", "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]")
  * As a Special Summoning-based Deck, the deck is weak to anti-Special Summoning effects and floodgates. (e.g. "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]", "[[Dimensional Barrier]]")
  * The deck is reliant on searching, and is thus weak to anti-searching floodgates. (e.g. "[[Mistake]]", "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]")
  * The deck is reliant on tributing, and is thus weak to anti-tributing floodgates. (i.e. "[[Mask of Restrict]]").
  * As most of the deck's removal options target, the deck is weak to monsters that cannot be targeted by card effects.
  * "[[Majespecter Orthrus - Nue]]" is the Deck's central combo maker and advantage generator, and is thus a prime target for negation effects.
  * The deck has no in-archetype Spell/Trap removal, making it weak to Spell/Trap based strategies.
