  {{Quote|Master numeric manipulation!|source=''TCG'' commercial for ''[[Mystic Fighters]]''}}
  "'''Mathmech'''", known as "'''Zanki'''" ({{Ruby|斬|ザン}}{{Ruby|機|キ}} ''Zanki'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Cyberse]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Mystic Fighters]]''. It is comprised of primarily [[Level]] 4 monsters of various [[Attribute]]s that focus on [[Synchro Summon|Synchro]] and [[Xyz Summon]]ing. They are used by [[Yami Kuroda]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures]]'' manga.

  == Etymology ==
  The "Mathmech" archetype is themed around [[wikipedia:Mathematics|mathematics]]. The Japanese names of the "Mathmech" monsters involve puns on mathematical terms.
  The name "Mathmech" is a portmanteau of "mathematics" and "mechanical". The Japanese name for "Mathmech" is ''Zanki'' ({{Ruby|斬|ザン}}{{Ruby|機|キ}}, lit. "cutting machine"), and it is a pun on ''keisanki'' ({{Ruby|計|けい}}{{Ruby|算|さん}}{{Ruby|機|き}}, "calculator").
  The name "Geomathmech" used on the archetype's [[Synchro Monster]]s is a portmanteau of "[[wikipedia:Geometry|geometry]]" and "Mathmech". The Japanese name for "Geomathmech" is ''Enzanki'' ({{Ruby|炎|エン}}{{Ruby|斬|ザン}}{{Ruby|機|キ}}, lit. "flame cutting machine"), and it is a pun on ''enzan'' ({{Ruby|演|えん}}{{Ruby|算|ざん}}, "[[wikipedia:Operation (mathematics)|operation]]"). The character ''en'' ({{Ruby|炎|えん}}, "fire") references their [[FIRE]] Attribute.
  The name "Primathmech" used on the archetype's [[Xyz Monster]]s is a portmanteau of "[[wikipedia:Prime (symbol)#Use in mathematics, statistics, and science|prime]]" and "Mathmech". The Japanese name for "Primathmech" is ''Kaizanki'' ({{Ruby|塊|カイ}}{{Ruby|斬|ザン}}{{Ruby|機|キ}}, lit. "clod cutting machine"), and it is a pun on ''kaizan'' ({{Ruby|改|かい}}{{Ruby|竄|ざん}}, "[[wikipedia:Mathematical fallacy|falsification]]"). The character ''kai'' ({{Ruby|塊|かい}}, "clod") references their [[EARTH]] Attribute.

  == Design ==
  The "Mathmech" monsters resemble humanoid robots armed with various types of swords. The Extra Deck "Mathmech" monsters are the combined forms of the "Mathmech" monsters.

  === Members ===
  ==== Main Deck Monsters ====
  The archetype's Main Deck members can be divided into three sub-series based on their visual and thematic designs. Each sub-series includes one Tuner monster.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Mathmech" archetype focuses on swarming Level 4 Cyberse monsters in order to perform Synchro, Xyz, and Link Summon plays. The archetype also focuses on OTK'ing by manipulating ATK and using their boss monster "[[Geomathmech Final Sigma]]", though current Decks using "Mathmech" generally don't bother with this strategy.

  * The "algebra" sub-series ("[[Mathmech Sigma|Sigma]]", "[[Mathmech Addition|Addition]]", and "[[Mathmech Subtraction|Subtraction]]") are generic Level 4 extenders that Special Summon themselves, but Cyberse-lock. "Addition" and "Subtraction" also increase/decrease a Cyberse monster's ATK by 1000, respectively.
  * The "analysis" sub-series ("[[Mathmech Nabla|Nabla]]", "[[Mathmech Multiplication|Multiplication]]", and "[[Mathmech Division|Division]]") support Extra Deck plays by providing Summoning from Deck ("Nabla"), Summoning from hand and GY ("Division"), or level modulation ("Multiplication"). If they are sent to the GY, they will also trigger a combat-boosting effect, either providing two attacks ("Nabla") or double ATK ("Multiplication") to a friendly Cyberse monster in the [[Extra Monster Zone]], or halving a monster's ATK ("Division").
  * The "geometry" sub-series provides powerful and varied support effects. 
  ** "[[Mathmech Diameter|Diameter]]" revives a Level 4 Cyberse monster when Normal Summoned, and grants a "Mathmech" Synchro/Xyz monster summoned using it as a material an omni-negate in the turn it's summoned. 
  ** "[[Mathmech Circular|Circular]]" is an extender that sends a 1 "Mathmech" monster from Deck to the GY as cost to Special Summon itself, generally "Sigma". On field, if a "Mathmech" monster is summoned, it searches an archetypal Spell/Trap.

  The archetype's Extra Deck monsters consist of 2 Synchro Monsters and 2 Xyz Monsters:
  * "[[Geomathmech Magma]]" (Level 8 Synchro) can destroy two cards when it destroys a monster by battle, and can search a "Mathmech" Spell/Trap when it is destroyed.
  * "[[Geomathmech Final Sigma]]" (Level 12 Synchro) becomes unaffected by card effects, except for "Mathmech" cards, while it is the [[Extra Monster Zone]], and also deals double battle damage when it battles a monster. Combine this with the archetype's combat boosting effects, and "Final Sigma" can easily perform an OTK on its own.
  * "[[Primathmech Alembertian]]" (Rank 4 Xyz, 2+ monsters) can search any "Mathmech" card when Xyz Summoned, and can Tribute 1 monster to Special Summon any "Mathmech" from hand or GY. It is an important searcher and combo-enabler for almost all of the deck's combos.
  * "[[Primathmech Laplacian]]" (Rank 4 Xyz, 3 monsters) can send up to 3 cards the opponent possesses to the GY when Xyz Summoned (1 each from their hand, S/T zone, and monster zone), and can protect friendly "Mathmech" cards from being destroyed by detaching its materials. It is a formidable board-clearer, and can become a powerful disruption piece if summoned with "[[Mathmech Superfactorial]]" in the opponent's turn.

  The archetype's Spells and Traps allow for revival and ATK boosting with "[[Mathmech Equation]]", triggering effects of various "Mathmech" Main Deck monsters with the Equip Spell "[[Mathmech Billionblade Nayuta]]", further ATK boosting and card removal with "[[Mathmech Induction]]", and Spell Speed 2 Extra Deck Summoning through "[[Mathmech Superfactorial]]".

  "Mathmech" is often used in Cyberse pile decks, using the archetype for Link fodder and the powerful effect of "Superfactorial".
