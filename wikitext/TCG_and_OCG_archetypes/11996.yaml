  "'''Ninja'''" ({{Ruby|忍|にん}}{{Ruby|者|じゃ}} ''Ninja'') is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They are primarily supported by the "[[Ninjitsu Art]]" Spell and Trap Card archetype. A handful of the "Ninja" cards existed in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|TCG]]'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game|OCG]]'' prior to being united by support cards in later sets. Various characters that used "Ninja" decks in the anime include [[Jean-Claude Magnum]] from [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters]], [[Kaze]] from [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]], as well as  [[Moon Shadow]] and [[Sun Shadow]] from [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]].

  "Ninja" cards used by Jean-Claude Magnum were a candidate to be released in [[Collection Pack 2020]] and received 2.8% of votes in the poll, coming in 7th place.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Ninja" archetype, true to their namesake's notoriety as covert operatives specializing in sabotage, primarily focuses on a [[Control]] playstyle through the utilization of various "Ninjitsu Art" cards in order to disrupt the opponent, build up resources, and prepare for a larger assault through swarming the board. Many "Ninja" monsters often prefer being placed in face-down Defense Position to trigger their effects when flipped face-up, letting them surprise the opponent with various strong effects or, in some cases, unexpectedly high [[Defense Position|defense]]. Most higher-Level "Ninja" monsters, however, are not as powerful ATK-wise as those found in other themes, but make up for it with a wide variety of effects tailored to disrupt and whittle away at the opponent's Life Points.

  The biggest tools of a "Ninja" deck are the "Ninjitsu Art" series of Spell and Trap Cards that serve to benefit the theme in various ways through generating sudden advantages and dishing out disadvantages for the opponent. Some examples include "[[Armor Ninjitsu Art of Rust Mist|Rust Mist]]" halving the opponent's Special Summoned monsters' ATK, "[[Ninjitsu Art of Duplication|Duplication]]" to [[Tribute]] one "Ninja" monster and summon many lower-[[Level]] "Ninja" monsters totaling the tributed monster's Level, as well as "[[Ninjitsu Art of Dancing Leaves|Dancing Leaves]]" and the various "Transformation" Ninjitsu Art cards ([[Ninjitsu Art of Transformation|Transformation]], [[Ninjitsu Art of Super-Transformation|Super-Transformation]], and [[Ninjitsu Art of Mirage-Transformation|Mirage-Transformation]]) to instantly [[Special Summon]] a stronger "Ninja" monster or even stronger monsters of other types. When a "Ninjitsu Art" card is no longer effective, the archetype also provides means of removing them from the field; such as "[[Armor Ninjitsu Art of Alchemy]]" to destroy them and draw cards as well as the effects of "[[Baku the Beast Ninja]]" and "Dancing Leaves" to return them to the hand and use their effect again.

  Among the many different cards in the theme, "Ninjas" are often divided into a handful of sub-series that each prioritize different aspects of the theme's overall playing style:

  * '''FLIP Ninja''' - The primary playstyle of the theme, FLIP Ninjas specialize in using the effects of "Ninja" monsters when [[Summon|Summoned]] or flipped face-up to generate advantage and control the board state. Through key cards such as "[[Ninja Grandmaster Hanzo]]", "[[Yellow Ninja]]", as well as the cards introduced in "[[Darkwing Blast]]" and beyond, "Ninja" is able to go toe to toe with various decks and win through clever usage of "Ninjitsu Art" cards and amass large boards of monsters; including the [[Fusion Monster]], "[[Meizen the Battle Ninja]]", to attack directly with your entire field of monsters and ensure quick games. This portion of the archetype also specializes in control through cards such as "[[Jioh the Gravity Ninja]]" to flip cards face-down and lock them in place as well as "[[Mitsu the Insect Ninja]]" to negate an opponent's monster effect by flipping itself face-down and another "Ninja" monster face-up.
  * '''[[Dragon Ninja]]''' - Dragon Ninjas are a sub-series of higher-Level, non-Warrior "Ninja" monsters that typically cannot be Special Summoned except through the effect of a "Ninja" monster or a "Ninjitsu Art" card, the types of which are themed around the Monster Types summoned through "Ninjitsu Art of Transformation" ([[Beast]], [[Winged Beast]], and [[Insect]]) and "Super-Transformation ([[Dragon]], [[Dinosaur]], and [[Sea Serpent]]}. Most Dragon Ninjas have disruption effects requiring the sending of both a "Ninja" and "Ninjitsu Art" card from the hand or field that can put a halt to various plans the opponent may attempt. One particularly effective strategy of this sub-series centers on "[[White Dragon Ninja]]" and its ability to prevent Spell and Trap cards the player controls from being destroyed by card effects, allowing for control builds using the cards "Safe Zone" and "Anti-Spell Fragrance" to create a near permanent threat for the opponent to deal with.
  * '''[[Armor Ninja]]''' - Armor Ninjas are a more aggressive sub-series focused on Level manipulation and generating Rank 4-5 Xyz Monsters. While the majority of Armor Ninjas are less impactful to the overall strategy of the archetype, one card that sees plenty of use is the [[Rank]] 4 [[Xyz Monster]], "[[Blade Armor Ninja]]", which has the effect to detach 1 material to allow a "Ninja" monster to attack twice for that turn. This effect, in tandem with the more [[Aggro|aggro]]-focused "Ninja" boss monsters, can lead to sudden and swift victories.
  * '''Twilight Ninja''' - Twilight Ninjas are a sub-series focused more on Defenses: "[[Twilight Ninja Shingetsu]]" prevents other "Ninja" monsters to be target for attacks or with effects, while "[[Twilight Ninja Nichirin, the Chunin]]" can discard "Ninja" monsters to protect "Ninja" monsters and "Ninjitsu Art" cards from destruction; "Nichirin" and 2 "Shingetsu" provide an efficient lockdown from most attacks and effects. The series also utilizes a pair of [[Pendulum Monster]]s to the archetype to [[Pendulum Summon]] several "Ninja" monsters from hand at once with ease. The most notable card of this sub-series is "[[Twilight Ninja Getsuga, the Shogun]]", a Level 8 "Ninja" monster that is able to Special Summon 2 "Ninja" monsters from the GY by changing itself to Defense Position. Barring this, the Pendulum Scales also allow for simple benefits from inflicting piercing damage to gaining ATK while also having a Pendulum Scale of 1-10 to Pendulum Summon most any monster in the archetype with a few exceptions; such as the aforementioned "Dragon Ninjas".

  The following archetypes also include some "Ninja" monsters, but do not conform to the main Ninja playing styles:
  * [[Karakuri]]
  * [[Penguin]]
  * [[Superheavy Samurai]]
  * [[Vaylantz]]

  == Trivia ==
  * "[[Barrier Ninjitsu Art of Transcription]]", "[[Blind Spot Strike]]", "[[Spy Attack]]", and "[[Debunk]]" suggest that "Ninja" have some sort of rivalry with "[[Shien]]". Also, "[[Ninjitsu Art of Super-Transformation]]" implies a rivalry between the "Ninja" and the "[[Karakuri]]" monsters, despite the fact that some monsters are members of both archetypes.
