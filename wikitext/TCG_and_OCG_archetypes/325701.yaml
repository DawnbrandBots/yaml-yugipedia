  "'''Aquaactress'''" (アクアアクトレス ''Akua-akutoresu'', written as アクア・アクトレス in the anime) is an [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Aqua]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] (WATER [[Fish]] in the anime) used by [[Allie]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime.

  == Design ==
  "Aquaactress" monsters are fish wearing human make-up and attire, similar to actors in a play, while their support cards are elements related to plays, such as "lighting" and "stage". Each "Aquaactress" monster is named after a kind of fish. Also, their names and general appearance are based on tropical freshwater fish.

  == Playing style ==
  "Aquaactress" monsters revolve around quickly [[swarm]]ing the field, having search and [[Special Summon]]ing monster effects, while using "[[Aqua Story - Urashima]]" and the "[[Aquarium]]" [[Continuous Spell Card]]s to quickly raise their [[ATK]], as well as other battle effects.
  "Aquarium" cards are the true strength behind "Aquaactress" archetype. The three current "Aquarium" cards give them [[Aquarium Set|attack boosts]], [[Aquarium Stage|immunity to monster effects]] and [[Aquarium Lighting|double ATK when they battle]], while the "Aquaactress" themselves give the Deck consistency, as "[[Aquaactress Tetra]]" is able to search "Aquarium" cards, which would otherwise be hard to get.
  All "Aquarium" [[Continuous Spell Card]]s also have this effect: "''If this card is [[send|sent]] from the [[field]] to the [[Graveyard]]: You can [[target]] 1 [[Aqua]] monster in your Graveyard; [[Special Summon]] it, also you cannot Special Summon monsters for the rest of this turn, except Aqua-Type monsters.''". This extends their support even further, giving the Deck a wide range of Aqua utility monsters. By using "[[Magical Hats]]", you can Summon up to 2 Aqua monsters from your Graveyard, and since it was done in your opponent's turn, you are free to Special Summon non-Aqua monsters during your turn.
  Due to how relatively small the "Aquaactress" archetype is, the Deck usually contains other WATER or Aqua engines such as "[[Frog]]", "[[Mermail]]", "[[Penguin]]", or "[[Icejade]]".

  == Weaknesses ==
  * Cards such as "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]" can remove the "Aquarium" cards without triggering their effects. "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]" and "[[Imperial Order]]" Can also hinder these cards from supporting the monsters on the field.
  * As "Tetra" and "Arowana" add from Deck to Hand, a variety of "[[Hand trap]]s" can hinder the deck such as "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" and the ever common "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]"
