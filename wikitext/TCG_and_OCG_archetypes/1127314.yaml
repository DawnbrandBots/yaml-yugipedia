  "'''Doom King'''", known as "'''Death Great King'''" ({{Ruby|死|し}}{{Ruby|偉|い}}{{Ruby|王|おう}} ''Shiiō'') in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] [[Pendulum Monster]]s composed of "[[D/D/D Doom King Armageddon]]", [[Declan Akaba]]'s [[signature card]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime, and its [[Card evolutions|upgraded]] forms. All "Doom King" monsters are also part of the "[[D/D]]" archetype (and its "[[D/D/D]]" sub-archetype). It received its first support in ''[[Doom of Dimensions]]''.

  ==Etymology==
  The archetype's Japanese name is a pun on "C.E.O." ([[wikipedia:Chief executive officer|chief executive officer]]), referencing the company hierachy theme of the "D/D/D" archetype.
