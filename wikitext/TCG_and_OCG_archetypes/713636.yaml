  ; The Beetroopers' Three Giant Beetles Lay Waste To Enemy Battlefields!
  ''There was once a group that commanded insects much like a rider does their steed, and acted in unison to expand their territory. Known as the "Beetroopers", they wield incredible military might and unique strategies. Among them, the standouts are naturally the three giant beetles boasting the greatest power, since the moment these giant beetles, led by "[[Ultra Beetrooper Absolute Hercules]]", make their way into the fray, the battle may as well be over.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ygorganization.com/card-lore-beetrooper-blurb/|title=[Card Lore] “Beetrooper” Blurb|author=NeoArkadia|date=July 20, 2022|website=The Organization|access-date=July 21, 2022}}</ref>

  == Etymology ==
  "Beetrooper" is a portmanteau of "beetle" and "trooper". In the OCG, "Beetrooper" is a forced reading, with the kanji "騎甲虫" essentially meaning "Beetle-Riding Knight".

  == Design ==
  [[File:Beetrooper-ConceptArt.png|thumb|right|300px|Concept art.]]
  The "Beetrooper" monsters are [[Insect]] monsters of various [[Attributes]] that resemble humanoid insects mounted on top of larger insects. Both riders and mounts are equipped with armor and weaponry reminiscent of medieval knights.
  The mounts range from a variety of different species of insects, especially beetles. In contrast, the riders appear to be members of the same race, albeit themed after their respective mounts.

  The "Beetrooper" boss monsters are [[EARTH]] [[Insect]] monsters that resemble gigantic beetles fortified with castle-like towers manned by troops of archers, not unlike [[wikipedia:War elephant|war elephants]] in antiquity. Each of them bears a different [[wikipedia:Coat_of_arms|coat of arms]], likely representing different warring factions.
  Each monster represents a different type of [[Special Summon]]ing.

  == Playing style ==
  "Beetrooper" is an archetype focused on [[swarm]]ing the board with various [[Insect]] monsters and building towards formidable boss monsters. Most "Beetrooper" monsters have effects focused on [[Special Summon]]ing themselves or other "Beetrooper" monsters. Examples of this include "[[Beetrooper Scout Buggy]]", which Summons another copy of itself when [[Normal Summon|Normal]] or Special Summoned, and "[[Beetrooper Sting Lancer]]", which can Special Summon itself during either [[Main Phase]] from the [[hand]] by returning a monster from both [[Graveyard]]s to the bottom of the [[Deck]] and [[add]]ing 1 "Beetrooper" [[Spell]]/[[Trap Card]] from the Deck to the hand if Special Summoned. This playstyle is also facilitated by a minor focus on Summoning [[Token Monster]]s through the effects of various Spells and Trap Cards both in and outside the archetype; such as "[[Beetrooper Descent]]", "[[Beetrooper Formation]]", and the Spell "[[Multiplication of Ants]]"
  Their primary boss monster is the [[Link Rating|Link]]-4 [[Link Monster]], "[[Giant Beetrooper Invincible Atlas]]", which has protection from targeting and effect destruction while it has 3000 or less [[ATK]], and the effect to [[Tribute]] an Insect monster the player controls to either Special Summon another "Beetrooper" monster from the Deck or gain 2000 ATK, dropping its protections for the turn in favor of [[damage]]. Other boss monsters for the theme include the new [[Level]] 8 Main Deck monster, "[[Heavy Beetrooper Mighty Neptune]]", which Special Summons itself from hand by returning 3 banished Insect monsters to the Deck, returns to the field if [[destroy]]ed or [[banish]]ed by an opponent's card effect in the Main Phase, and grants a permanent 1000 ATK gains to an Insect monster during the [[End Phase]], as well as the Level 11 [[Fusion Monster]], "[[Ultra Beetrooper Absolute Hercules]]", which requires 4 Insect monsters as [[Fusion Material]]s, is [[unaffected]] by all other card effects until the end of the player's next turn, and Special Summons an Insect monster with 3000 or less ATK from the Graveyard at the end of the [[Battle Phase]].
