  "'''Plunder Patroll'''", known as "'''Plundroll'''" ({{Ruby|海造賊|プランドロール}} ''Purandorōru'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] introduced in ''[[Ignition Assault]]'' as a [[TCG Exclusive|World Premiere]].

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Master Duel card storylines#We the Merry Plunder Patroll}}

  == Etymology ==
  "Plunder Patroll" is named after [[wikipedia:Looting|plunder]] and a portmanteau of patrol + [[wikipedia:Troll|troll]]. "[[Blackbeard, the Plunder Patroll Captain]]" and the [[Main Deck]] "Plunder Patroll" monsters are based on various roles of crew members on a ship. The [[Extra Deck]] "Plunder Patrollship" monsters are based on various ships. The "Plunder Patrollship" monsters are named after the Norwegian words for their respective [[attribute]]s.

  == Members ==
  "Plunder Patroll" is themed around a fleet of [[wikipedia:Vikings|Viking]] ships manned by a [[wikipedia:Piracy|pirate]] crew of green-skinned trolls.

  === Monsters ===
  The "Plunder Patroll" monsters are thematically divided between crew members and ships.
  ; Crew members
  Except for "[[Blackbeard, the Plunder Patroll Captain]]" (a [[Link Rating|Link]]-[[Link 2 Monster Cards|2]] [[WATER]] [[Link Monster]]), all crew members are [[Level]] [[Level 4 Monster Cards|4]] [[WATER]] [[Main Deck]] monsters.

  == Playing style ==
  The '''Plunder Patroll''' theme's playstyle revolves around summoning archetypal Extra Deck monsters for free during the opponent's turn based on the Attribute of the monsters the opponent controls or are in their GY. Currently, there are 5 boss monsters; a [[FIRE]] [[Synchro Monster]], a [[DARK]] [[Xyz Monster]], a [[LIGHT]] [[Fusion Monster]], a [[EARTH]] [[Synchro Monster]] and a [[WATER]] [[Link Monster]]. By doing so, they can equip themselves to the cards and make the discard effects of "[[Plunder Patrollship Brann]]" and "[[Plunder Patrollship Moerk]]" into Quick Effects. In synergy with this, the Field Spell card, "[[Plunder Patroll Shipyarrrd]]", gives all Plunder Patroll monsters you control 500 ATK for each Plunder Patroll card in your S/T Zone and can set itself from the GY to the field by returning a Plunder Patroll card from your S/T zone to the hand. This not only makes the Field Spell live once more, but also provides fodder for both Patrollships. As well, the Continuous Trap, "[[Plunder Patroll Booty]]" provides a means of changing attributes on the field and revival/recycling for the deck, which is useful if you need to recycle the non-properly-Summoned boss monsters of the Deck.

  == Weaknesses ==
  * As the deck rely on summoning non-[[WATER]] "Plunder Patrollship" [[Extra Deck]] monsters, "[[Gozen Match]]" can prevent a "Plunder Patroll" decks from summoning any of these monster, as "[[Blackbeard, the Plunder Patroll Captain]]", the key card for summoning Extra Deck monsters, is a WATER monster.
