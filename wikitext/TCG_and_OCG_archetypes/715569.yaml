  "'''Lady of Lament'''", known as "'''Demon Lady'''" ({{Ruby|悪|あく}}{{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|嬢|じょう}} ''Akumajō'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]] 3 [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] introduced in ''[[Structure Deck R: Curse of the Dark]]''/''[[Structure Deck: Lair of Darkness]]''. While it first appeared in 2018, the archetype did not receive support until ''[[Battle of Chaos]]'', in 2021.

  == Design ==
  All "Lady of Lament" monsters are female [[Fiend]] monsters that resemble popular image of a [[wikipedia:Succubus|succubus]], with distinct demonic features like claws, horns, tail and three pair of membrane wings (one each on their head, back, and waist). They wear skintight clothes that cover almost all of their body, except their face, and spiky demonic armor brimming with red energy around the edge. These features are similar to those of [[Ahrima, the Wicked Warden]] and [[Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair|Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair]]. Most "Lady of Lament" monsters (except "[[Loris, Lady of Lament]]") have different colored eyes: one green and one red with a deep dark sclera.

  == Playing style ==
  All "Lady of Lament" monsters are [[Level]] 3 Fiend monsters whose total [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] equal exactly 2000. Their effects are heavily related to [[Tribute]] monsters as a [[cost]], and also support [[Normal Trap Card]]s, so they have direct synergy with "[[Lair of Darkness]]", the "[[Labrynth]]" [[archetype]], and the [[Virus]] [[series]].

  === Lair of Darkness ===
  "Lady of Lament" forms a central component of the "[[Lair of Darkness]]" strategy, which focuses on the titular [[Field Spell]]. Aside from the "Lady of Lament" archetype, "Lair of Darkness" is also associated with a broad series of other cards released in ''[[Structure Deck: Lair of Darkness]]'', as well as their associated cards. These include:
  * [[Virus]] series
  * Diabolos series ("[[Darkest Diabolos, Lord of the Lair]]" and "[[Diabolos, King of the Abyss]]")
  The series, as a whole, focuses on using the effect of "[[Lair of Darkness]]" to Tribute the opponent's monsters to activate the player's card effects, and using those effects to establish a resource loop made up of disruptive [[Trap Card]]s.
