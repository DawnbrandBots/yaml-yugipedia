  "'''Monarch'''" ({{Ruby|帝|てい}}{{Ruby|王|おう}} ''Teiō''), also referred to as "'''Emperor'''" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|''Yu-Gi-Oh ARC-V'' manga]], is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s that support the "[[Monarch (series)|Monarch]]" [[series]] of monsters. It was first introduced in ''[[Cosmo Blazer]]''; after ''[[Shadow Specters]]'' introduced the "Mega Monarchs", these cards' artwork show how the "Monarchs" transformed into the "Mega Monarchs".

  Due to its Japanese name, "[[Emperor of the Land and Sea]]" falls into this archetype. Despite having "Monarch" in their English names, the monsters in the "Monarch" series are not a part of this archetype due to their Japanese names. However, because ''[[TCG]]'' and ''[[OCG]]'' support for this archetype only works on [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s that are not on the field, neither of these cases currently have an impact on gameplay.

  == Playing style ==
  {{Main|Monarch (series)#Playing style}}
  Many cards in the archetype, such as "[[The Monarchs Stormforth]]" and "[[Domain of the True Monarchs]]", either lock the player out of the [[Extra Deck]] or require the player to have an empty Extra Deck.

  Certain cards were also used as a draw engine. "[[Tenacity of the Monarchs]]" can search for "[[Pantheism of the Monarchs]]", which can dump a "[[The Prime Monarch]]" in hand to draw 2. "The Prime Monarch" can then use its GY effect to generate Tribute/material without any locks. Combined with cards like "[[Trade-In]]" and "[[Erebus the Underworld Monarch]]", this engine could be used to enable a "[[Magical Explosion]]" [[FTK]], or act as a [[Chaos]]-like GY engine capable of recycling powerful Monsters like "[[Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning]]" or "[[Dark Armed Dragon]]".
