  "'''Smile'''" (スマイル ''Sumairu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s used by [[Yuya Sakaki]], [[Yusho Sakaki]], and [[Yoko Sakaki]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. Aesthetically, cards in this archetype feature smiley faces in their artwork, which can be seen in the dueling environment when the cards are played in the anime. Each card in the archetype has an effect that involves the [[ATK]] of monsters on the [[field]], with the exception being the [[Field Spell]], "[[Smile Action]]", which is meant to simulate [[Action Duel]]s with its effects.
