  "'''Windwitch'''" ({{Ruby|ＷＷ|ウィンド・ウィッチ}} ''Windo Witchi'') is an [[archetype]] of [[WIND]] [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Rin]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. They debuted in ''[[Raging Tempest]]''.
  ==Design==
  The monsters of of this archetype follow the naming pattern "Windwitch - [noun] Bell", where the noun is a word relating to cold or a transparent item (e.g. "Snow" and "Glass"). Visually, all of them have a big bell somewhere on their bodies as accessories. The Main Deck monsters shown so far have the appearance of either a stereotypical magical girl riding on a broom-like bell (e.g. "Glass Bell" and "Ice Bell") or a literal bell itself ("Snow Bell"). The Extra Deck monsters, on the other hand, have more abstract-looking appearances consisting of a feminine figure with bells and jet aircraft parts integrated in the body.
  ==Playing style==
  The "Windwitch" monsters focus on freely swarming the field for [[Synchro Summon]]s. The most important starter is "[[Windwitch - Ice Bell]]" which can Special Summon itself and another "Windwitch" monster from the deck while there are no monsters the user's field. The most important choice is to summon (though while also a potent starter itself) is the Level 4 [[Tuner monster]] "[[Windwitch - Glass Bell]]" which can search another "Windwitch" monster upon its summon. The ideal search choices are either "[[Windwitch - Snow Bell]]" or "[[Windwitch - Freeze Bell]]", both which can freely Special Summon themselves from the hand and provide protection effects to a Synchro Monster that uses either of them as material for a Synchro Summon (protection from either effect destruction or battle destruction with "Snow Bell" or "Freeze Bell" respectively). As such, the engine of "Ice Bell", "Glass Bell" and "Snow Bell" can effectively Synchro Summon a powerful Level 8 WIND Synchro Monster that cannot be destroyed by card effects such as "[[Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon]]" without using a [[Normal Summon]]. However, their effects restrict the user into only being able to Special Summon [[WIND]] [[Attribute]] monsters for the turn, while the self-Special Summoning effect of "Ice Bell" further restricts the user into only Special Summoning Level 5 and higher WIND monsters for the turn, denying the user from [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] or [[Link Monster|Link]] plays.

  "Windwitches" also focus on a [[burn]] strategy which many of their cards' effects (namely, "Ice Bell", "[[Windwitch - Blizzard Bell|Blizzard Bell]]", "[[Windwitch - Winter Bell|Winter Bell]]" and "[[Windwitch - Diamond Bell|Diamond Bell]]") can deal [[effect damage]]. The introduction of "Windwitch - Diamond Bell" gives further utility to their burn strategy, since "Diamond Bell" can destroy cards whenever the opponent takes effect damage. Thus any means of inflicting damage (even during the opponent's turn which "Blizzard Bell" can be used for) can aid in disrupting the opponent and/or break their board. "Windwitches" are supported by "[[Windwitch Chimes]]" which can Special Summon additional "Windwitch" monsters from the Deck and "[[Icy Breeze Refrain]]", which can either Special Summon a "Windwitch" monster from the [[Graveyard|GY]] or negate an opponent's effect in response to a "Windwitch" monster's effect. In the anime, the high-Level monsters can copy the effects of monsters in the Graveyard, allowing the user to keep indirectly reactivating the burn effects. The real-life versions instead have "Windwitch - Winter Bell" focuses on swarming and burn tactic, while the effect of "[[Windwitch - Crystal Bell]]" is toned down to the user's turn only but also capable of copying the monster's name.

  "Windwitch" plays similarly to "[[Speedroid]]", another WIND-based archetype geared towards Synchro Summoning, coinciding with the relationship of their users in the anime (Rin and [[Yugo]] respectively). This implies that "Windwitches" can be an engine that can be teched into a "Speedroid" Deck and vice-versa.
