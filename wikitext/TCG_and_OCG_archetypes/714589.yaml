  ;The Isolated, Faraway Land<nowiki>:</nowiki> 'The Abyss'
  ''There are many who call it 'The Abyss', it is a continent isolated from the rest of the world. In the land of 'The Abyss', a huge different dimension called 'The Hole' appeared in times long lost from the traces of memory, which is well known to open its 'jaws' and swallow both people and regions whole. However, 'The Hole' is not just a disaster that swallows men, but in rare, almost miraculous, cases, it brings forth power that could be called 'Grace Beyond Human Understanding' to the world. One time, it was an unknown form of dark matter. Another, it brought forth what appeared to be a relic from a long lost civilization. And yet another, even a life form...''
  ;The Political Superpower of 'The Abyss'<nowiki>:</nowiki> The "[[Dogmatika Nation]]"
  ''Located in the far north of 'The Abyss' is a political superpower, that has the church as the central political authority, lead by "[[Dogmatika Maximus]]" as the supreme leader and highest authority. Their army of crusaders, made up of followers of the "Dogmatika" faith, eradicate heathens and heretics, by devoutly following the path of "Dogmatika", by which they perform miracles via 'Stigmata', the mark of their faith.''
  ;"[[Dogmatika Nexus]]"
  ''The 'Stigmata' is a mark given to all members of the "Dogmatika" faith. The followers and agents of the faith receive this power of the divine through the holy relic "Dogmatika Nexus", administered by "Maximus Dogmatika", and this power is capable of creating mysterious miracles. Among them are those who are particularly powerful, who fight heretics that threaten the stability of the nation as soldiers of its crusading army.''
  ;"[[Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous]]"
  ''A maiden raised by the church since childhood. With the 'Stigmata' shining brightly on her forehead, and her pure personality, people call her a saint along with "Fleurdelis"''.
  ;"[[Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted]]"
  ''The knight commander of the crusaders, who, thanks to the 'Stigmata' on all four of her limbs, wields the three holy relics of the church, the Sword, the Shield, and the Armor, that can only be wielded by those with truly incredible power of miracles. She is the other saint who serves as the moral authority of the nation's people.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ygorganization.com/agehaactivateshergreatestnormalholecard/|title=[Lore] So About The Dragma|author=NeoArkadia|date=April 18, 2020|website=The Organization}}</ref>

  ==Etymology==
  The Japanese name for the "Dogmatika" archetype is likely a [[wiktionary:portmanteau|portmanteau]] of the words "[[wiktionary:dragon|dragon]]" and "[[wiktionary:dogma|Dogma]]". As indicated by "[[Dogmatikaturgy]]", it is also a play on "drama", referencing the theme of "[[Despia]]". Most of the monsters' names reference the Church and religion.

  The "Dogmatika" [[Ritual Monster]]s and [[Ritual Spell]]s applies the kanji 「{{Ruby|凶|きょう}}{{Ruby|導|どう}}」 (''Kyōdō'', literally "Wicked Path"; figuratively "Heretical") to the ''Dragma'' reading in their Japanese names, unlike the rest of the "Dogmatika" monsters, which use 「{{Ruby|教|きょう}}{{Ruby|導|どう}}」 (''Kyōdō'' "Dogmatic") instead. This refers to the latter half of the 'Abyss' lore, where the "Dogmatika" eventually revealed their true colors.

  ==Members==
  Most of the "Dogmatika" monsters have either "[[Despia]]" [[counterpart]]s or "[[Swordsoul]]" counterparts, as in the latter half of the 'Abyss' lore, the "Dogmatika" monsters divide into two opposing sides.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Dogmatika" [[archetype]] is thematically focused on countering [[Extra Deck]] monsters (referring to [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]], [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]], [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]], [[Link Monster]]s). To this end, cards in this archetype commonly feature three shared conditions and effects:
  * Effect [[activate|activation]] condition that requires presence of monsters Special Summoned from the Extra Deck on the [[field]] (including Main Deck [[Pendulum Monster]]s Special Summoned from the Extra Deck) or Extra Deck monsters in the [[Graveyard]]
  * Effect to [[send]] monsters from the Extra Deck directly to the GY
  * Effect to restrict the player from [[Special Summon]]ing from the Extra Deck

  The [[Level]] 4 "Dogmatika" monsters, "[[Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous|Ecclesia]]", "[[Dogmatika Adin, the Enlightened|Adin]]", and "[[Dogmatika Theo, the Iron Punch|Theo]]", all share the following two effects:
  :''"Cannot be destroyed by battle with a monster Special Summoned from the Extra Deck."''
  :''"[Once per turn,] If a monster Special Summoned from the Extra Deck is on the field: You can Special Summon this card from your hand."''

  Between these three, the individual effect of "Ecclesia" overshadows that of the other two, since she can search any "Dogmatika" card from the [[Deck]] to the [[hand]] when [[Normal Summon|Normal]] or Special Summoned, at the cost of preventing the player from Special Summoning from the Extra Deck for the rest of the turn.

  The Level 8 and 11 "Dogmatika" monsters have varying effects to Special Summon themselves and various individual effects.
  * "[[Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted|Fleurdelis]]" can Special Summon herself as a [[Quick Effect]] if an Extra Deck monster is on the field, [[negate]] a monster's effects for a turn if the player [[control]]s another "Dogmatika" monster when she's Special Summoned, and can also boost the [[ATK]] of "Dogmatika" monsters when they declare an attack. She is commonly used as a disruption and an attack booster to push for game.
  * "[[Dogmatika Maximus|Maximus]]" can Special Summon itself by [[banish]]ing an Extra Deck monster from the GY, and has an effect to have both players send 2 monsters from the Extra Deck to the GY. It is the main method by which the archetype strategically loads the GY with Extra Deck monsters to gain advantage out of them.
  * "[[Dogmatika Ashiyan|Ashiyan]]" can Special Summon itself when an Extra Deck monster is sent to the GY outside of the [[Damage Step]], and can recover "Dogmatika" cards in the GY and boost ATK, making for a useful recovery option.
  * "[[Dogmatika Nexus]]", the Level 11 boss monster for the archetype, can Special Summon itself by banishing 4 Extra Deck monsters from the GYs, and can destroy all opposing [[Attack Position]] monsters when it attacks a Special Summoned monster. While definitely powerful, its [[Summoning conditions]] take some effort to fulfill quickly.

  Fitting with the archetype's restrictions against the Extra Deck, the archetype has several [[Main Deck]] [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]] boss monsters and Ritual [[support]].
  * "[[White Knight of Dogmatika]]" has a [[Trigger Effect]] to have its controller look and send 1 monster from both player's Extra Decks to the GY whenever the opponent activates a card or effect, providing a unique disruption opportunity and also making it a formiddable attacker depending on the ATK of the sent monsters. It prevents the controller from Special Summoning from the Extra Deck however.
  * "[[White Relic of Dogmatika]]" can make one of two targeted monsters on the field as a powerful [[beatstick]] while passively protecting its controller's Level 8 or higher "Dogmatika" monsters from being destroyed by battle. It also enables its controller to look and send 1 monster from the opponent's Extra Deck to the GY whenever the opponent Special Summons from the Extra Deck.
  * "[[Dogmatika Alba Zoa]]" is a powerful body with 4000 ATK/4000 DEF that passively protects the player's "Dogmatika" monsters from being affected by the effects of their opponent's Extra Deck monsters and can make the oponent either return all Extra Deck monsters they control to the Extra Deck, or send cards from their hand or Extra Deck to the GY.
  * The Ritual Spell "[[Dogmatikalamity]]" can send a monster from the Extra Deck to the GY as a substitute for [[Tribute]]s in the [[Ritual Summon]]. 
  * The Ritual Spell "[[Dogmatikamacabre]]" banishes Fusion or Synchro Monsters in the GY as substitutes for Tributes in the Ritual Summon and can also Ritual Summon from the GY. It can also send a monster from either Extra Deck to the GY if both "White Knight" and "White Relic" are present.
  * "[[Dogmatikaturgy]]" can Ritual Summon from the hand or Deck though it requires Tributing "Dogmatika" monsters, Fusion or Synchro Monsters on the field. It can also recur "Dogmatika" monsters from the GY.
  * "[[Dogmatikamatrix]]" can search a "Dogmatika" Ritual Monster or Ritual Spell (and an additional "Dogmatika" card if the opponent controls a monster) upon activation and can also send a monster from either Extra Deck to the GY if a "Dogmatika" Ritual Monster is on the field.

  Other "Dogmatika" [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card|Trap]] cards and support provide more utility to the Deck, and further involves the archetypal mechanic of sending monsters from the Extra Deck to the GY. The most notable among these are "[[Nadir Servant]]", the archetype's main searcher and recovery tool, and "[[Dogmatika Punishment]]", a [[Normal Trap Card|Normal Trap]] that destroys opposing monsters. Both of the aformentioned cards send monsters from the Extra Deck to the GY as a part of their effects, and other "Dogmatika" Spells/Traps, including "[[Dogmatikacism]]" and "[[Dogmatika Nation]]", also have similar effects. Like "Ecclesia", using "Nadir Servant" and "Dogmatika Punishment" will also prevent the player from Special Summoning from the Extra Deck for the turn (though the restriction of "Punishment" lingers until the end of the player's next turn).

  A pure "Dogmatika" Deck is broadly control-based, focusing on Summoning their Ritual boss monsters and sending monsters from both player's Extra Decks to the GY. Extra Deck monsters with beneficial GY effects are thus invaluable for the Deck. "[[Titaniklad the Ash Dragon]]", "[[Granguignol the Dusk Dragon]]" are the main choices to be sent from the Extra Deck to the GY by a "Dogmatika" Deck, as they can search ("Titaniklad" only) or Special Summon a "Dogmatika" monster from the Deck after they are sent to the GY while "[[Despian Luluwalilith]]" can Special Summon any LIGHT Spellcaster whose ATK equals its DEF. All three are ideal for summoning "Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous" which in turn searches "Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted" for its negate during the opponent's turn. Other Extra Deck monsters with beneficial effects in the Graveyard include "[[Elder Entity N'tss]]", "[[Herald of the Arc Light]]", "[[Wind Pegasus @Ignister]]", and "[[Fossil Warrior Skull Knight]]" for searching more cards or removing the opponent's cards from the field.

  The archetype's supporting cards has some overlap with supporting "[[Fallen of Albaz]]" as well, which can be situationally useful to [[Fusion Summon|fuse]] away the opponent's monsters. However, the archetype's restrictions against Special Summoning from the Extra Deck makes "Albaz" and its associated cards a poor fit for it.

  ===Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika===
  "Invoked Shaddoll Dogmatika" is a hybrid of the "Dogmatika" archetype with the "[[Invoked]]" and "[[Shaddoll]]" archetypes, taking advantage of the "Dogmatika" archetype's ability to easily bin "Shaddoll" monsters from the [[Extra Deck]] directly to the [[GY]] to [[trigger]] the GY effects of "Shaddoll" [[Fusion Monster]]s.

  Specifically, "[[Nadir Servant]]" and "[[Dogmatika Maximus]]" can [[send]] "[[El Shaddoll Apkallone]]" and "[[El Shaddoll Construct]]" directly from the Extra Deck to the GY, triggering their GY effects to search out and/or recover the "Shaddoll" [[Fusion Summon]] [[Trap Card]] "[[Shaddoll Schism]]", which would be used to Fusion Summon "[[El Shaddoll Winda]]" on the opponent's turn to [[floodgate]] the opponent. After completing this central combo of Fusion Summoning "Winda", the additional "Dogmatika" resources generated during the combo are used to make disruptions, through cards such as "[[Dogmatika Punishment]]" or " [[Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted]]". The "Invoked" component of the [[Deck]] meanwhile serves as a method to easily make Extra Deck monsters to enable the "Dogmatika" monsters' [[Special Summon]]s.

  }}

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Cards with effects that redirects cards being sent to the GY to being banished instead (e.g. "[[Macro Cosmos]]", "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]") can prevent the player from benefitting the effects of their various sent Extra Deck monsters or from fully resolving all parts of the "Dogmatika" card effects (e.g. "Nadir Servant" won't add a "Dogmatika" monster to the hand and "Dogmatika Punishment" won't destroy the targeted monster) 

  * "Dogmatika" decks don't hinder Decks which does not care about Summoning from their Extra Deck or do not have any cards in their Extra Deck to begin with. In the latter case, the player won't be able to activate the Extra Deck milling effects of "Dogmatika Maximus" and the "Dogmatika" Ritual Monsters.
