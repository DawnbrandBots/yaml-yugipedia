  "'''@Ignister'''" ({{Ruby|＠|アット}}イグニスター ''Atto Igunisutā'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Cyberse]] monsters used by [[Ai]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]''. They are supported by the "[[A.I.]]" archetype.

  == Design ==
  <div style="float:right">[[File:@Ignister logo.png|150px|right|thumb|The "@Ignister" symbol, as seen on "[[Dark Templar @Ignister]]".]]</div>
  The Deck consists of multiple Cyberse monsters with various shapes and forms. The fodder monsters resemble blobs with different designs, but with coloration resembling that of the [[Ignis]]. By contrast, the boss monsters have more defined traits.
  Members like "[[Dark Templar @Ignister]]" and some associated like "[[Linguriboh]]" are essentially corrupted versions of monsters used by [[Yusaku Fujiki|Playmaker]] ("[[Decode Talker]]" and "[[Linkuriboh]]", respectively). On top of that, all but one of the archetype's boss monsters have 2300 ATK, a direct reference to the "Code Talkers". The only exception is "[[The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister]]", which is more of a counterpart to Yusaku's "[[Firewall Dragon Darkfluid]]".
  All "@Ignister" monsters (except "The Arrival" and "Dark Infant") have a common symbol, which is an irregularly shaped blue (purple in the case of the "@Ignister Token") ring on their bodies, which resembles an "@" symbol.
  The Deck represents Ai's memories of himself and his fellow Ignis, before the latter were terminated.

  == Members ==
  The [[Main Deck]] "@Ignister" monsters have at least 1 card for each different [[Attribute]] except [[DIVINE]]; six "blob" monsters that each represent the Ignis of each Attribute, as well an additional monster that represent Ai himself (in addition to "[[Doyon @Ignister|Doyon]]" in the Main Deck and "[[Dark Templar @Ignister|Dark Templar]]" in the Extra Deck) and two others that represent other characters that Ai met in his life. There is also a set of 6 [[Extra Deck]] (and 1 [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]]) "boss monsters" for each Attribute that has 2300 ATK, except for "The Arrival Cyberse" with 0 ATK. Later on, "[[Dark Infant @Ignister]]" was added to the archetype, a support Link Monster that resembles a smaller, "immature" version of "The Arrival Cyberse".
  The Main Deck "@Ignister" monsters are each named after a Japanese onomatopoeia that relates to their Attribute, while the Extra Deck monsters (except for "The Arrival Cyberse" and "Dark Infant") are named after mythical creatures (and a knight) that are usually associated with their respective card's Attribute in fantasy fiction.

  '''Newer members'''

  These new members from ''[[Alliance Insight]]'', in addition to "[[Firewall Saber Dragon]]" listed below, are based on cards used by [[Yusaku Fujiki]]. They seem inspired by Ai's proposal to fuse with Yusaku for eternity.

  == Playing style ==
  The effects of the Main Deck monsters aid in generating advantage; those that correspond with a more specific Summoning method support that method and often have [[Special Summon]]ing effects, while those corresponding to a less specific Summon method focus on other methods of card advantage.
  In the anime, the Extra Deck monsters require using a monster as the same Attribute as material for their Summon. Their effects are generally stronger when the player controls multiple "@Ignister" monsters, and they have a strong focus on allowing their effects to activate through successful battle.
  The primary combo of an "@Ignister" Deck is to activate "[[Ignister A.I.Land]]" and use its effect to continually Special Summon "@Ignister" monsters to the field for use as Link Material for "[[Dark Templar @Ignister]]", then via the effect of "A.I.Land", Special Summon a monster to a zone that "Dark Templar" points to, triggering its effect to revive as many Level 4 or lower "@Ignister" to the zones that it points to. The release of "[[Dark Infant @Ignister]]" has bolstered this strategy even further; in addition to searching "Ignister A.I.Land" upon its [[Link Summon]], "Dark Infant" can be Link Summoned to a zone "Dark Templar" points to to trigger the latter's revival effect, while the second effect of "Dark Infant" can then move itself to the zone it points to and change its Attribute, thereby not only allowing "Dark Templar" to revive up to three "@Ignister" monsters, but also providing a different [[Attribute]] for use in Link Summoning the Deck's most powerful monster; "[[The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister]]". Using "Dark Infant" to search "Ignister A.I.Land" also allows for more reliable flexibility in using the effect of "[[Pikari @Ignister]]" to search for "[[A.I.]]" Spells and Traps.

  == Weaknesses ==
  * As the Deck focuses on multiple attributes, it is prone to struggling against "[[Gozen Match]]". It might also suffer against "[[Summon Limit]]" and "[[El Shaddoll Winda]]"
  * "@Ignister" will also potentially struggle if they're prevented from accessing "[[Ignister A.I.Land|A.I.Land]]" through [[Negate|Negating]] "Dark Infant", "[[Terraforming]]" or Activating "[[Imperial Order]]", "[[Set Rotation]] and [[Anti-Spell Fragrance]] when you've been able to go first against it.
  * Although "[[The Arrival Cyberse @Ignister]]" is a near-invincible boss monster on its own, "[[Lava Golem]]", "[[Kaiju]]" monsters and "[[Underworld Goddess of the Closed World]]" can easily remove it and bypass its immunity effect, leaving the player vulnerable to opponent's counterplay.
