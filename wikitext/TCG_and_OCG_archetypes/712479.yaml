  "'''Adamancipator'''", known in Japan as "'''Adamassiah'''" (アダマシア ''Adamashia''), is an [[archetype]] of [[Rock]] [[monster]]s which debuted in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Secret Slayers]]''. It is a Synchro Archetype comprised of mostly Level 4 monsters of different attributes and two Level 2 EARTH monsters. They are used by [[Anna Des]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures]]''.

  == Design ==
  The archetype's card artworks tell the story of a trio of cave explorers exploring a magical cave, where they find and unseal magical beasts encased in crystals, who reveal their true forms and bond with their liberators.
  The archetype's monsters are divided into three sub-groups:
  * The monsters simply named "Adamancipator" are the cave explorers. They are low-Level EARTH Rock Tuner monsters with ATK and DEF that add up to 2200, with two being Level 2 and one being Level 4. They share the effect to excavate the top 5 cards of the Deck and Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Rock non-Tuner monster from the cards excavated.
  * The "Adamancipator Crystal" monsters are the crystal-encased magical beasts. They are Level 4 Rock non-tuner monsters of FIRE, WATER, and WIND Attributes with 0 ATK and 2200 DEF. They trigger positive effects when they're summoned by "Adamancipator" cards, and they share a GY effect that recycles a Synchro Monster of their attribute and returns themselves to the top of the Deck.
  * The "Adamancipator Risen" monsters are the unsealed forms of the crystalline beasts, with explorers riding on top of them. They are high-Level Synchro versions of the "Adamancipator Crystal" monsters, sharing their FIRE, WATER, and WIND, Attributes. They have individual effects that involve excavation, as well as Quick Effects that can be used if a monster of their Attribute is in the GY.

  === Etymology ===
  The archetype's name is a portmanteau of ''[[wikipedia:adamant|adamant]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:messiah|messiah]]'' (in Japanese) or ''[[wikipedia:Emancipation|emancipator]]'' (in English).
  Most cards in the archetype have names in Japanese that feature the kanji 「{{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|救|きゅう}}」 (''Makyū''), literally "Magic Salvation", but in all cases they are assigned with the "Adamassiah" reading.
  The kanji name of "Adamancipator Crystal" is 「{{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|救|きゅう}}の{{Ruby|奇|き}}{{Ruby|石|せき}}」 (''Makyū no Kiseki''), and means "Rare Stone of Magic Salvation". The kanji name of "Adamancipator Risen" is the homophonous 「{{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|救|きゅう}}の{{Ruby|奇|き}}{{Ruby|跡|せき}}」 (''Makyū no Kiseki''), and means "Miracle of Magic Salvation".

  == Playing style ==
  "Adamancipator" revolves around [[Excavate|excavating]] the top 5 cards of the player's Deck to perform beneficial actions, with a general Synchro and Link Summoning-based swarming and combo playstyle. The usage of excavation effect, in particular by the "Adamancipator" Tuner monsters, reflects their lore as cave explorers; they 'explore' (excavate) into 'caves' (the player's Deck) and 'discover' (Special Summon) magical crystal monsters.

  Each "Adamancipator" Tuner monster has an [[only once per turn]] effect to excavate the top 5 cards of the player's Deck, and Special Summon an excavated Level 4 or lower Rock non-Tuner monster. This shared effect enables rapid swarming of Rock monsters, with the downside of potential inconsistency due to random chance. Summoning "Adamancipator" Tuners and successfully resolving their individual excavation effects as many times as possible is central to the deck's swarming and combo capabilities.

  Each "Adamancipator" Tuner has another effect that lets them Special Summon themselves from the hand, if conditions are met.

  In-archetype, the intended targets for the "Adamancipator" Tuners' excavation effects are the "Adamancipator Crystal" monsters, who can trigger a positive effect upon being summoned by "Adamancipator" cards. Each of them also have a GY effect that lets them recycle themselves, along with a Synchro monster with their Attribute (in-archetype, this can be their "Adamancipator Risen" counterparts), from the GY back into the Deck.

  The "Adamancipator Risen" are the main boss monsters of the archetype. Each has two effects: an [[Ignition Effect]] involving excavating 5 cards, and a [[Quick Effect]] that requires another monster with their Attribute in the GY as a precondition. "[[Adamancipator Risen - Dragite|Dragite]]" bounces with excavation and has a Spell/Trap negate, "[[Adamancipator Risen - Raptite|Raptite]]" Summons a Rock with excavation (like the "Adamancipator" Tuners) and has a GY banish interruption, and "[[Adamancipator Risen - Leonite|Leonite]]" adds 1 "Adamancipator" card with excavation and has a GY revival effect in the opponent's turn.

  In terms of Spell and Trap support, all of the archetype's Spells provide extra consistency for finding and resolving the effects of "Adamancipator" Tuner monsters, by placing cards on the top of the Deck and situationally searching or recovering individual Rock monsters. The archetype's Trap cards supplement their effect lineup with card destruction and monster effect negation, which the "Adamancipator Risen" monsters lack.

  Externally, many non-"Adamancipator" Rock monsters can also be summoned by "Adamancipator" Tuners, allowing much more varied deck builds.
  * The "[[Koa'ki Meiru]]" cards, in particular the Level 4 monsters with negation effects (i.e. "[[Koa'ki Meiru Guardian|Guardian]]", "[[Koa'ki Meiru Overload|Overload]]", "[[Koa'ki Meiru Sandman|Sandman]]", "[[Koa'ki Meiru Wall|Wall]]"), provide additional pieces of interruption and work well with the archetype's Level needs.
  * "[[Koa'ki Meiru Supplier]]" is an additional extender with searching capabilities.
  * "[[Doki Doki]]" can be used to Special Summon additional Rock monsters from the Deck, including more "Adamancipator" Tuners.
  * "[[Prank-Kids Rocksies]]" can be used to provide more bodies by linking it into "[[Prank-Kids Meow-Meow-Mu]]".

  Generally, an "Adamancipator" deck aims to maximize the "Adamancipator" Tuners' (& "Raptite"'s) excavation effects, in order to swarm the field and Synchro/Link climb into boss monsters. The inherent inconsistency within the excavation effects is typically addressed in one of two ways: including and using "Adamancipator" Spell cards, or by fine-tuning deck composition to include a critical mass of Rock monsters. "Adamancipator" end boards typically include "[[Adamancipator Risen - Dragite]]", along with other high-power generic boss monsters such as "[[Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess]]", "[[Borreload Savage Dragon]]", or "[[Accesscode Talker]]".

  In formats where the card is/was available, "[[Block Dragon]]" is a critical extender for "Adamancipator" combos, as it could search out all of the "Adamancipator" Tuners and non-OPT revive itself for Link/Synchro climbing.

  == Weaknesses ==
  * Cards that prevent the Activation of Effects in hand such as "[[Mind Drain]]" slow down this deck's swarm capability as the Normal Summon is used to Summon the Tuners instead.
  * Being largely made up of Monsters, the deck also finds problems when it encounters "[[PSY-Framegear Gamma]]", "[[Vanity's Fiend|Vanity's]]" [[Vanity's Ruler|Monsters]] or similar. "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]] or [[Infinite Impermanence]] will also slow the deck down by a Monster, although is critical to the deck when used in response to "[[Adamancipator Researcher|Researcher]]" which can be summoned by "[[Crystron Halqifibrax]]".
  * Although largely made up of [[EARTH]] monsters, the deck's larger monsters are WATER, WIND and FIRE, making "[[Gozen Match]]" somewhat effective. Being [[Rock]] based, [[There Can Be Only One]] also cripples the deck, as does "[[Summon Limit]]"

  == Trivia ==
  * "[[Dwimmered Path]]" and "[[Dwimmered Glimmer]]" are suggested to share a lore connection with the "Adamancipator" archetype, as their card arts feature caves similar to the one seen in "[[Adamancipator Laputite]]", and the corresponding word for "Dwimmered" in their names, "{{Ruby|救|きゅう}}{{Ruby|魔|ま}}" (''Kyūma'', literally "Spell Salvation") is an anagram of the kanji characters used for the word "Adamassiah" in the "Adamancipator" cards' OCG names, "{{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|救|きゅう}}" (''Makyū'').
