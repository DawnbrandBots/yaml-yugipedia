  "'''Fortune Fairy'''", known as "'''Fortune-Telling Witch'''" ({{Ruby|占|うらな}}い{{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|女|じょ}} ''Uranai Majo'') in the Japanese version, is an [[archetype]] of [[Spellcaster]] monsters used by [[Carly Carmine]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime prior to her death and rebirth as [[Dark Signer]]. The archetype consists of Spellcaster monsters with 0 [[ATK]] and [[DEF]], each with a different [[Level]] from 1 to 6. Prior to their release as [[Effect Monster]]s in the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'', this archetype consisted entirely of [[Normal Monster]]s.

  == Design ==
  Each member of the "Fortune Fairy" archetype is named and colored according to their own [[Attribute]].

  In the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's'' anime and the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Tag Force]]'' series, they are Normal Monsters whose flavor text each tells the fortune of the person who draws it, along with a listing of a lucky number, color, and item. The lucky color and number correspond to that monster's Attribute and Level. The lowest Level "Fortune Fairy" monster, "Hikari", is the best prediction (''Super Happy''), and the predictions get less optimistic as they go up in Level, with the Level 6 "Chee" being the worst (''Absolutely Awful''). The fortune may be said to be based on the usefulness of you having such a card in the hand during a Duel (e.g. a Level 6 Normal Monster with 0 ATK and DEF being a pretty unlucky draw). Curiously, in the anime, "Chee" is the card Carly draws right before her Duel with [[Sayer]], which ends in her death and transformation to a Dark Signer.<ref name="ep37">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's|37|ref}}</ref>

  In {{episode|5D's|037|ref}}, it appeared that their playstyle focused on Summoning as many and as fast as possible, using cards such as "[[Lucky Loan]]" and "[[Unacceptable Result]]", then using the key card "[[Miracle Stone]]" to increase their ATK. Otherwise, Carly's use of these monsters mimicked [[Sartorius]]' use of his "[[Arcana Force]]" monsters as tarot cards.

  The redesign of the "Fortune Fairy" archetype in the ''OCG''/''TCG'' plays similarly but with a heavier emphasis on draw power. The "Fortune Fairies" are now Effect Monsters that the player can [[Special Summon]] from their hand upon drawing them and possess effects that can activate when Special Summoned from the hand. Additionally, "Miracle Stone" gives a smaller boost but boosts ATK and DEF, and allows a player to draw once per turn when a "Fortune Fairy" battles. This benefits the swarming ability at the expense of battling ability.

  After Carly became a Dark Signer, the "Fortune Fairy" monsters evolved into the "[[Fortune Lady]]" archetype, where each member appear to be older and "more twisted" versions.<ref name="ep38">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's|38|ref}}</ref>

  Starting in the English version of ''[[Duel Terminal 1]]'', the "Fortune Fairies" appear in the "[[Card Only Get]]" mode.

  |}

  == Playstyle ==
  The main focus of the archetype is to [[swarm]] the [[field]] to take advantage of the ATK-boosting effect of "Miracle Stone". Since their effects activate upon drawing them, one should include cards that facilitate drawing outside of the Draw Phase such as "[[Reload]]", "[[Counter Gate]]", and "[[Defense Draw]]", as well as cards that facilitate Special Summoning from the hand such as "[[A Hero Emerges]]" and "[[Intruder Alarm - Yellow Alert]]".

  [[Synchro Summon]]ing becomes a viable strategy due to the ease of summoning the high-Level "Ann" and "Chee", as well as "Hikari's" effect facilitating the summon of [[Tuner monster]]s including "[[Sunny Pixie]]", "[[Fortune Lady Past]]", or any "[[With Eyes of Blue]]" Tuner monster. Since "Miracle Stone" boosts the ATK of all Spellcaster monsters the user controls, include monsters that facilitate Summoning such as "[[Magical Exemplar]]" and "[[The Tricky]]". "En" and "Swee" cause the most disruption against the opponent, while "Hikari's" effect can Summon monsters such as "[[Copycat]]" to turn the opponent's strength against them.

  == Trivia ==
  * This archetype's cartoony aesthetic is very similar to that of the 1999 magical girl anime ''[[wikipedia:Ojamajo Doremi|Ojamajo Doremi]]''.
