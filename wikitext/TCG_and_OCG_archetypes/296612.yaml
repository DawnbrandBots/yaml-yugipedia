  "'''Artifact'''" (アーティファクト ''Ātifakuto'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fairy]] [[Monster Card|monsters]], primarily [[Level 5|Level]]/[[Rank 5 Monster Cards|Rank 5]], based around artifacts and weapons of ancient history and mythology. They benefit from being [[destroy]]ed by card [[effect]]s, and their Main Deck members can be [[Set]] as [[Spell Card]]s.

  == Design ==
  "Artifacts" are based on different types of ancient weapons (except "Beagalltach" and "Moralltach", which are a set of twin swords based on two related swords in the same myth, and "Durendal", which is the combined form of the two prior "Artifacts") with names based on mythological and historical weapons of the same design.

  Visually, "Artifacts" share the same gold and silver coloration, with a [[wikipedia:Steampunk|steampunk-ish]] motif along with a dark black circle along the central vertical axis (two circles for the Xyz and Link) of the weapon and thick black lines engraved along the body and blade. When the monster is "active" (as seen in "[[Artifact Ignition]]"), the dark circle is replaced with a gear-like emblem shared among all the "Artifacts" with a colored glow unique to that artifact, with the black engravings sharing that color. Of note, all extra deck "Artifacts" have a number of circles equivalent to the number of materials needed to Summon them (2, in the case of both "[[Artifact Durendal]]" and "[[Artifact Dagda]]").

  The colors of the glowing emblem and engravings follow the 7 colors of the rainbow and 4 colors of the CMYK color model (the exception being "[[Artifact Durendal]]," which combines "[[Artifact Beagalltach]]" and "[[Artifact Moralltach]]" colors). Along with that, a single colored glowing spirit sharing its color is holding the "Artifact" while activated. According to the Primal Origin Booster Pack Guide, these spirits are artificial wielders generated by the weapons based on their most powerful owners. These spirits bear a strong resemblance to [[Equip Spell Card]]s Summoned as monsters by [[Geko Tenma]] under the influence of "[[Armament Reincarnation]]".

  == Story ==
  The "Artifacts" are ancient relics that once were used by heroes of other ages. They dwell in a "Treasure Vault" hidden beyond mountains. Using an energy source and their memories, they are able to manifest themselves in the form of those who wielded them in the past. However, it seems many of their memories are missing, and even without knowing why, they can merge together to work as one single "Artifact", one of those being the [[Artifact Durendal|Memory-Severing Sword, Durendal]], created with the power of "Beagalltach" and "Moralltach".<ref>[http://www.ygorganization.com/ocg-artifact-lore/ YGOrganization] - [OCG] Artifact Lore</ref>

  == Playing style ==
  All Main Deck "Artifact" monsters share the following effects:
  * You can Set this card in the Spell & Trap Zone as a Spell.
  * During the opponent's turn, if this card is destroyed as a Set card in the Spell & Trap Zone and sent to the GY, Special Summon it.

  Most of the monsters can trigger another effect if Special Summoned during the opponent's turn (even if through another card's effect). This gimmick allows the "Artifact" monsters to punish the opponent for blindly destroying backrow, and/or allow the controller to benefit if they can Summon their own "Artifact" monsters.

  === Cards ===
  The key consistency pieces are:
  * "[[Artifact Sanctum]]", a Trap which can Special Summon an "Artifact" monster from Deck. If destroyed by an opponent's card (even if face-up), it can also destroy 1 card on field.
  * "[[Artifact Ignition]]", a Quick-Play which can destroy a Spell/Trap, then Set an "Artifact" monster into the Spell & Trap Zone from the Deck. If destroyed by an opponent's card (even if face-up), it can also destroy 1 card on field.
  * "[[Artifact Dagda]]", a generic Link-2 which can Set an "Artifact" monster into the Spell & Trap Zone from the Deck. Also, if destroyed on the opponent's turn (by either player), it can Special Summon an "Artifact" monster from GY in Defense Position (thus preventing "Dagda" from Summoning itself this way).

  As for monsters, common targets to run include "[[Artifact Scythe]]" to lock the opponent from Summoning from the [[Extra Deck]] (prior to its [[Forbidden]] status), "[[Artifact Moralltach]]" to destroy an opposing card, and "[[Artifact Lancea]]" to prevent any cards from being [[banish]]ed.

  Because the "Artifact" monsters are difficult to Summon on their own, it is relatively hard to build a pure "Artifact" Deck. Instead, they were often played as a small engine within other Decks. For example, Trap Decks could benefit from "Artifact" monster's ability to punish the opponent from destroying backrow while making use of "Sanctum" and "Ignition". Combo Decks could make use of "Dagda" in order to access any "Artifact" monster. 

  Cards like "[[Malevolent Catastrophe]]", "[[Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer]]", and "[[Ryzeal Detonator]]" can help destroy Set "Artifact" monsters while being useful on their own. If playing a more "Artifact"-centric Deck, cards like "[[Shining Angel]]" and "[[Nova Summoner]]" can help get "Artifact" monsters on field, enabling the Xyz Summon of Rank 5s like "[[Artifact Aegis]]" (as a strong defense) or "[[Artifact Beagalltach]]" (to destroy and Special Summon more "Artifacts").

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "[[Denko Sekka]]" and "[[Dark Simorgh]]" prevent the opponent from Setting cards, largely shutting off the archetype.
  * Cards that banish or move monsters in the GY to another place, such as "[[D.D. Crow]]", "[[Bystial]]s" (all "Artifact" monsters are LIGHT), and the "[[Exchange of the Spirit (series)|Ishizu]]" shufflers, can prevent "Artifact" monsters from being summoned. They can also be outed by cards that banish/bounce/shuffle backrow, such as "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]".
  ** However, cards that banish "Artifacts" can be countered by "[[Artifact Lancea|Lancea]]".
  * Floodgates:
  ** "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]" negates any "Artifact" effects from being activated. "[[Soul Drain]]" and "[[Silent Graveyard]]" will negate their self-revival effects.
  ** "Artifact" monsters must be sent to the GY to activate their effects, so anti-GY floodgates like "[[Macro Cosmos]]" and "[[Dimension Shifter]]" will prevent them from being summoned.
  ** Generic anti-Special Summon / effects floodgates like "[[Evilswarm Ophion]]", "[[El Shaddoll Winda]]", and "[[Skill Drain]]" (since their effects activate on field).
