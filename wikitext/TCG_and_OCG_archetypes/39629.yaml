  "'''Batteryman'''" ({{Ruby|電|でん}}{{Ruby|池|ち}}メン ''Denchimen'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Thunder]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. Initially, "Batteryman" Decks were [[OTK]] Decks that focused on [[Special Summon]]ing three copies of "[[Batteryman AA]]". This allowed the player to then use "[[Short Circuit]]" to clear the opponent's field and then [[direct attack]] for a minimum of 9000 damage. However, following the release of "[[Batteryman Fuel Cell]]" and "[[Batteryman 9V]]", many different variants are possible, such as a "[[hunder]]" variant.
  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'', [[Dexter]]'s Deck contained at least one member of this archetype, "[[Batteryman AA (anime)|Batteryman AA]]".

  == Design ==
  The number shown on the chests of "[[Batteryman AA]]", "[[Batteryman AAA]]", "[[Batteryman C]]" and "[[Batteryman D]]" corresponds their Levels. This also relates to what their respective battery sizes are called in Japan.

  "Batterymen" with the recycling symbol on their heads are the ones able to be returned from the graveyard by "[[Recycling Batteries]]".

  == Playing style ==
  The "Batteryman" [[Deck]] has a lot of powerful specific [[support]] cards that have massive destruction capabilities. Although most of the "Batteryman" archetype is made up of weak monsters, poweful effects more than make up for it. "[[Batteryman 9V]]" is the key card of the archetype. By [[Summon]]ing it, any "Batteryman" card in the Deck can be [[search]]ed. "[[Batteryman Micro-Cell]]" can [[Special Summon]] any "Batteryman" from the Deck, usually "Batteryman 9V" for additional searching power and a 2000 [[DEF]] monster. "[[Batteryman Charger]]" is one of the most useful cards in the archetype, because it can Special Summon a "Batteryman" of any [[Level]] from the Deck when the player [[Normal Summon]]s it. Through cards like "[[The Monarchs Stormforth]]", it is easy to abuse. It also makes a good [[beatstick]], as [[swarm]]ing them can get its ATK up to a max of 3300 with relative ease. "[[Batteryman Industrial Strength]]" is the most powerful "Batteryman" (in terms of its destructive effect and original ATK) because it can [[destroy]] two cards the opponent [[control]]s with his effect, simply by [[banish]]ing a [[Thunder]] monster from the [[Graveyard]]. "[[Batteryman Fuel Cell]]" is one of the most important "Batteryman" card since most "Batteryman" [[OTK]]s rely on it. "[[Batteryman AAA]]" is also often used in "Batteryman" Decks for quick [[Xyz Summon]] plays. Since "Batteryman AAA" is a [[LIGHT]] monster, it allows access to powerful [[Rank]] 4 [[Xyz Monster]]s like "[[Starliege Paladynamo]]" and "[[Constellar Omega]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "[[Ally of Justice]]" and "[[Koa'ki Meiru]]" pose an extreme threat to the "Batteryman" monsters since they have effects that will [[negate]] and [[destroy]] them with ease because all of the "Batteryman" monsters are [[LIGHT]]-[[Attribute]].  "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]" can help too.
  * Mass-removal cards like "[[Torrential Tribute]]", "[[Dark Hole]]", "[[Mirror Force]]" and even "[[Doom Donuts]]" have the power to shut down "Batteryman" monsters, destroying all of them before they can [[attack]] and potentially [[OTK]]. In addition, cards that [[banish]] and cards that hinder [[Special Summon]]ing from the [[Graveyard]] or [[Deck]] will pose a threat to them, such as "[[Dimension Shifter]]" or "[[Royal Prison]]". Also, "[[Deck Devastation Virus]]", "[[King Tiger Wanghu]]", and "[[Kotodama]]" can be more effective for greatly hindering "Batteryman" Decks, especially OTK builds.
