  "'''Batteryman'''" ({{Ruby|電|でん}}{{Ruby|池|ち}}メン ''Denchimen'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Thunder]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'', [[Dexter]]'s Deck contained at least one member of this archetype, "[[Batteryman AA (anime)|Batteryman AA]]".

  == Design ==
  The number shown on the chests of "[[Batteryman AA]]", "[[Batteryman AAA]]", "[[Batteryman C]]" and "[[Batteryman D]]" corresponds their Levels. This also relates to what their respective battery sizes are called in Japan.

  "Batterymen" with the recycling symbol on their heads are the ones able to be returned from the graveyard by "[[Recycling Batteries]]".

  == Playing style ==
  "Batteryman" Decks are generally played as [[OTK]] Decks, focusing on breaking the opponent's board and then dealing enough damage to win. Other variants, such as "[[Hunder]]", also exist.
  * "[[Batteryman 9-Volt]]" is the main [[search]]er of the Deck, adding a "Batteryman" card from Deck to hand.
  * "[[Batteryman Micro-Cell]]" is a Flip Monster that can, on flip, [[Special Summon]] a Level 4 or lower "Batteryman" from the Deck.
  * "[[Batteryman Charger]]" is a level 5 monster that, on Normal Summon, can Special Summon a "Batteryman" from the Deck.
  * "[[Batteryman Fuel Cell]]" can Special Summon itself if you have two or more "Batteryman" monsters, and then bounce cards by Tributing a "Batteryman" monster.
  * "[[Batteryman Industrial Strength]]" can Special Summon itself by banishing two "Batteryman" monsters from the GY, and can banish a Thunder monster to destroy 1 monster and 1 Spell/Trap.
  * "[[Batteryman AAA]]" can Special Summon another copy of itself from hand or GY. Since it is a Level 4 LIGHT monster, it can be used to access Rank 4s like "[[Starliege Paladynamo]]" and "[[Constellar Omega]]".
  * "[[Batteryman Solar]]" can send a Thunder monster to the GY, and can Special Summon a "Batteryman Token" when a Thunder monster is Summoned.

  Since "Charger" essentially requires a Tribute Summon to use its Special Summon effect, "[[The Monarchs Stormforth]]" is a strong card for the Deck.

  The most recent support for "Batteryman" was "[[Batteryman Solar]]" (released 2018 in the ''TCG''), with all other cards dating from 2014 or earlier. Therefore, it has been heavily powercrept as an OTK Deck; most Decks can deal 8000 damage if they clear the opposing board, and the removal effects of "Batteryman" monsters are not impressive compared to generic [[Extra Deck]] removal cards.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As a [[LIGHT]] archetype, it can be countered by cards like "[[Koa'ki Meiru Drago]]" and  "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]".
  * Mass-removal cards like "[[Torrential Tribute]]", "[[Dark Hole]]", "[[Mirror Force]]" and even "[[Doom Donuts]]" have the power to shut down "Batteryman" monsters, destroying all of them before they can [[attack]] and potentially [[OTK]]. In addition, cards that [[banish]] and cards that hinder [[Special Summon]]ing from the [[Graveyard]] or [[Deck]] will pose a threat to them, such as "[[Dimension Shifter]]" or "[[Royal Prison]]". Also, "[[Deck Devastation Virus]]", "[[King Tiger Wanghu]]", and "[[Kotodama]]" can be more effective for greatly hindering "Batteryman" Decks, especially OTK builds.
