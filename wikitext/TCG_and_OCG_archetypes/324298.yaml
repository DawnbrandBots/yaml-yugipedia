  == Trivia ==
  The printed Simplified Chinese names of the "Double Beast" and "Doodlebook" cards were slightly altered from those in ''[[Master Duel]]'', by replacing certain Chinese characters with pinyin, with some of those pinyin characters not supported by the font and looking out of place.<ref>[https://nga.178.com/read.php?tid=38962705&rand=132 A forum post comparing the names in ''Master Duel'' and on proxies.]</ref><ref>[https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Fx4y1y722/ An unboxing of the actual prints of the set [[Nature Pack: Blazing Heroes|万象包－炽炎英杰－]]]</ref> It is not clear whether this is a font limitation, since these altered names are also listed on the official Simplified Chinese card database.
