  "'''Invoked'''", known as "'''Invoked Beast'''" ({{Ruby|召|しょう}}{{Ruby|喚|かん}}{{Ruby|獣|じゅう}} ''Shōkanjū'') in the [[OCG]], is an [[archetype]] of [[Fusion Monster]]s debuting in ''[[Booster SP: Fusion Enforcers]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Master Guide 6 card storylines#The Threat of "La Maison" Opposing "Endymion"}}

  == Design ==
  Design-wise, the archetype consists of "Invoked" [[Fusion Monster]]s who are seemingly Summoned through [[Invocation|magic powers]] by [[Aleister the Invoker|sorcerers]].

  Individually, each "Invoked" (aside from "Augoeides", "Elysium" and "Magistus Omega") represents a different [[Attribute]], with their [[Fusion Material]]s being "[[Aleister the Invoker]]" plus one monster of their specific Attribute, and are named after historical or mythological elements related to said Attribute. They also contain the staff of "Aleister" somewhere in their artworks, but much brighter than the original.

  == Playing style ==
  The archetype is centered around Summoning "Invoked" Fusion monsters each turn, with Decks often relying on the constant resource loop provided by "[[Aleister the Invoker]]" and "[[Invocation]]", which works as follows:

  # "[[Aleister the Invoker]]", on Normal Summon, searches "[[Invocation]]".
  # "Invocation's" field effect performs a Fusion Summon by banishing "Aleister" + another monster from hand, your field, or either GY.
  # "Invocation's" GY effect adds "Aleister" back to hand and shuffles itself to Deck, enabling the combo to be repeated each turn.

  The Fusions all have generic materials. For each Attribute, there is an "Invoked" monster that requires "Aleister" + any monster of that Attribute. The three others ("[[Invoked Augoeides|Augoeides]]", "[[Invoked Elysium|Elysium]]", and "[[Invoked Magistus Omega|Magistus Omega]]") each require "Aleister" + a non-specific [[Extra Deck]] monster as material, and are similarly easy to Summon. Their effects vary from disruption to aggression to floodgating.

  Since "Invocation" can perform a Fusion Summon by banishing from your field or either GY, it is easy to get the correct Attributes needed for an "Invoked" Fusion - the opponent's monsters, [[hand trap]]s, or your [[Extra Deck]] monsters, especially LINK-1s, can all be used as material. Common LINK-1s include "Aleister" → "[[Salamangreat Almiraj]]" (FIRE) → "[[Secure Gardna]]" (LIGHT) and "Aleister" → "[[Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden]]" (LIGHT), as the most desired payoff, "[[Invoked Mechaba]]", requires a LIGHT monster.

  In competitive play, "Invoked" was often splashed as an [[engine]] for Decks due to being compact, consistent, and great recursion for the time. It was mainly run in Decks that met the desired Attributes and/or did not need the Normal Summon, such as "[[Windwitch]]", "[[Shaddoll]]", "[[Dogmatika]]", and "[[Mekk-Knight]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Floodgates, including:
  ** Anti-Fusion Summon or Special Summon floodgates, like "[[Non-Fusion Area]]", "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", or "[[Dimensional Barrier]]", shut down the archetype.
  ** Anti-banish floodgates, like "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" or "[[Artifact Lancea]]", shut down "Invocation".
  ** Anti-search floodgates, like "[[Mistake]]" or "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" stop the archetype unless "Invocation" is drawn.
  ** "[[Gozen Match]]" and "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]", due to the Extra Deck monsters generally having different Types/Attributes than "Aleister".
  * GY disruption, such as the "[[Bystial]]" monsters, "[[Mudora the Sword Oracle]]", and "[[D.D. Crow]]" can remove "Aleister" from the GY before "Invocation" is activated.
  ** If "Invocation" is sent to the GY (e.g., with "[[Forbidden Droplet]]"), it can be used to recover a banished "Aleister". 
  ** An opposing "[[Branded Regained]]" can shuffle away the banished "Aleister", thus leaving "Invocation" in the GY with no banished "Aleister" to use its GY effect with.
  * "[[Chain Disappearance]]" can be used to banish all copies of "Aleister" at the time it is Normal Summoned.
  * A one-for-one handtrap, such as "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" or "[[Infinite Impermanence]]", can generally stop the engine unless "Invocation" is hard drawn. However, since "Invoked" is often run with other archetypes, these handtraps often won't stop all of the opponent's plays.
