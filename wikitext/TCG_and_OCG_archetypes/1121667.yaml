  "'''Power Patron'''", known as "'''Imprisoned God'''" ({{Ruby|獄|ごく}}{{Ruby|神|しん}} ''Gokushin'') in the ''OCG'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Main Deck]] [[Level]] 1 monsters with 300 [[ATK]]/200 [[DEF]] and [[Extra Deck]] Level/[[Rank]] 10 monsters introduced in ''[[Duelist's Advance]]''. It is connected to "[[Medius the Pure]]" and the "[[Artmage]]", "[[DoomZ]]", and "[[Elvennotes]]" archetypes.

  ==Lore==
  "Power Patrons" are higher beings living in the Spiritual World, which is cut off from the Real World. In an era of chaos brought about by various nations vying for supremacy, there was one powerful nation that prospered with the power of the "Power Patron": "[[Artmage Academic Arcane Arts Acropolis]]". It is an Academy City State that won the war against other nations with the power of "[[Nerva the Power Patron of Creation]]", one of the Gods of the Spiritual World. The academy, which was created for students to compete against each other learning "Armagi", drawing its magic power of "Nerva", eventually became a nation.

  "[[Medius the Pure]]" is a being who holds the destiny of "Artmage" in his hands with his power of "Future Prophecy". "Nerva" is the "Power Patron" who supplies magic power to "Artmage". "[[Artmage Diactorus]]" is "Medius" inheriting the power of "Nerva".

  ==Etymology==
  The [[Level 10]]/[[Rank 10]] "Power Patrons" are named after [[wikipedia:Roman mythology|Roman gods and goddesses]]. <!--If Blazing Dominion does not add a new Power Patron, replace "Roman gods and goddesses" with the Capitoline Triad (Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva).--> The [[Level 1]] members have the associated archetype in their names, and in the ''[[OCG]]'', they follow the naming scheme "Imprisoned God [descriptor]" ("[[Artmage Power Patron|Beast]]", "[[Power Patron DoomZ|Machine]]", and "[[Elvennotes Power Patron|Spirit]]").

  ==Members==
  Each "Power Patron" is associated with an archetype of a different [[Extra Deck]] [[monster card type]]. They come in pairs: a Level/Rank 10 Extra Deck monster and a Level 1 monster with 300 [[ATK]] and 200 [[DEF]] that brings out the former, or a monster from the archetype, but locks the Extra Deck to the specific monster type.

  In addition, pairs can have a "Diactorus" monster belonging to the associated monster card type, depicting "[[Medius the Pure]]" inheriting their power.
