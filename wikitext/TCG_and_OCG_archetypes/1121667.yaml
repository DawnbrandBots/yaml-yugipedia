  "'''Power Patron'''", known as "'''Imprisoned God'''" ({{Ruby|獄|ごく}}{{Ruby|神|しん}} ''Gokushin'') in the ''OCG'', is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Duelist's Advance]]''. It is connected to "[[Medius the Pure]]" and the "[[Artmage]]", "[[DoomZ]]", and "[[Elfnote]]" archetypes through the lore surrounding "Medius the Pure".

  ==Lore==
  "Power Patrons" are higher beings living in the Spiritual World, which is cut off from the Real World. In an era of chaos brought about by various nations vying for supremacy, there was one powerful nation that prospered with the power of the "Power Patron": "[[Artmage Academic Arcane Arts Acropolis]]". It is an Academy City State that won the war against other nations with the power of "[[Nerva the Power Patron of Creation]]", one of the Gods of the Spiritual World. The academy, which was created for students to compete against each other learning "Armagi", drawing its magic power of "Nerva", eventually became a nation.

  "[[Medius the Pure]]" is a being who holds the destiny of "Artmage" in his hands with his power of "Future Prophecy". "Nerva" is the "Power Patron" who supplies magic power to "Artmage". "[[Artmage Diactorus]]" is "Medius" inheriting the power of "Nerva".

  ==Etymology==
  The [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 10 "Power Patrons" are named after the Roman [[wikipedia:Capitoline Triad|Capitoline Triad]]. The Level 1 members have the associated archetype in their names instead, and in the ''[[OCG]]'', they follow the naming scheme "Imprisoned God [descriptor]" ("[[Artmage Power Patron|Beast]]", "[[Power Patron DoomZ|Machine]]", and "[[Elfnote Power Patron|Spirit]]"). The [[Pendulum Monster]]s are named after stages of the [[wikipedia:Magnum opus (alchemy)|alchemical magnum opus]] combined with the Roman god's name (with the exception of "[[Power Patron Shadow Machine Zegredo|Zegredo]]", which uses Jupiter's Greek name Zeus instead). "[[Vidrium the Power Patron of Chaos Extermination|Vidrium]]" is named after ''vide'', the French word for "void", and the [[wikipedia:Capitolium|Capitolium]], a temple dedicated the Capitoline Triad.

  ==Members==
  Each "Power Patron" is linked to a different [[archetype]], [[Type]], and [[monster card type]]. Except for "[[Vidrium the Power Patron of Chaos Extermination]]", they come in three trios: 
  * a Level/Rank 10 Extra Deck monster that requires 3 materials and has an alternate Summoning procedure
  * a Level 1 monster with 300 [[ATK]], 200 [[DEF]], and the same [[Attribute]] as the Extra Deck monster that locks its controller into the associated monster type, can Special Summon the Extra Deck member or a monster from the associated archetype, and when destroyed or sent to the [[Graveyard]] searches a card of the associated archetype
  * a Level 10 DARK Pendulum Monster that is always treated as a member of the associated archetype and also has with 300 ATK, 200 DEF, and an effect that Special Summons the Extra Deck member (for the cost of banishing the top 3 cards of the controller's Deck face-down), plus searching for "Power Patrons" or the associated archetype when added to the Extra Deck face-up and a self-destruction effect while in the [[Pendulum Zone]]
  In addition, some trios have a "Diactorus" monster belonging to the associated monster type and archetype, depicting "[[Medius the Pure]]" inheriting their power.
