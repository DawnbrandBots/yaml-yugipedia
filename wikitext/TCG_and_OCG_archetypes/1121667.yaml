  "'''Power Patron'''", known as "'''Imprisoned God'''" ({{Ruby|獄|ごく}}{{Ruby|神|しん}} ''Gokushin'') in the ''OCG'', is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Duelist's Advance]]''. It is connected to "[[Medius the Pure]]" and the "[[Artmage]]", "[[DoomZ]]", and "[[Elvennotes]]" archetypes.

  ==Lore==
  "Power Patrons" are higher beings living in the Spiritual World, which is cut off from the Real World. In an era of chaos brought about by various nations vying for supremacy, there was one powerful nation that prospered with the power of the "Power Patron": "[[Artmage Academic Arcane Arts Acropolis]]". It is an Academy City State that won the war against other nations with the power of "[[Nerva the Power Patron of Creation]]", one of the Gods of the Spiritual World. The academy, which was created for students to compete against each other learning "Armagi", drawing its magic power of "Nerva", eventually became a nation.

  "[[Medius the Pure]]" is a being who holds the destiny of "Artmage" in his hands with his power of "Future Prophecy". "Nerva" is the "Power Patron" who supplies magic power to "Artmage". "[[Artmage Diactorus]]" is "Medius" inheriting the power of "Nerva".

  ==Etymology==
  The [[Level 10]]/[[Rank 10]] "Power Patrons" are named after the Roman [[wikipedia:Capitoline Triad|Capitoline Triad]]. The [[Level 1]] members have the associated archetype in their names, and in the ''[[OCG]]'', they follow the naming scheme "Imprisoned God [descriptor]" ("[[Artmage Power Patron|Beast]]", "[[Power Patron DoomZ|Machine]]", and "[[Elvennotes Power Patron|Spirit]]"). The Level 10 [[Pendulum Monster]]s are named after stages of the [[wikipedia:Magnum opus (alchemy)|alchemical magnum opus]] combined with the Roman god name (with the exception of "[[Power Patron Shadow Machine Zegredo|Zegredo]]", which uses the Greek god Zeus instead). "[[Vidrium the Power Patron of Chaos Extermination|Vidrium]]" is named after ''vide'', the French word for "void", and the [[wikipedia:Capitolium|Capitolium]], a temple dedicated the Capitoline Triad.

  ==Members==
  Each "Power Patron" is associated with an archetype of a different [[Extra Deck]] [[monster card type]]. The Main Deck monsters all have 300 [[ATK]] and 200 [[DEF]], except for "[[Vidrium the Power Patron of Chaos Extermination]]".

  In addition, each "Power Patron" can have a Diactorus monster belonging to the associated monster card type, depicting "[[Medius the Pure]]" inheriting their power.
