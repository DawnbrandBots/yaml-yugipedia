  "'''Morganite'''" (モルガナイト ''Moruganaito'') is an archetype of [[Normal Spell Card]]s introduced in ''[[Cyberstorm Access]]''. It received its first support in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]''. 

  ==Design==
  Outside of ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'', morganite is a variety of beryl gemstone (like emerald and aquamarine), generally encompassing rare pink to salmon to orange shades of beryl. It is not to be confused with ''moganite'', which is an unrelated mineral which has the same chemical composition as quartz (a mineral used in some clocks).

  The card artworks of "Morganite" cards features a gemstone exuding an intense magical vortex of a specific color, with a pair of hands seemingly trying to grasp the stone.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Morganite" Spell Cards are distinguished by their unique ability to bestow lingering effects on the user that last for the remainder of the Duel they are activated in if they successfully resolve. These effects typically involve "doubling" the effectiveness of the player, such as doubling the number of cards they draw during the Draw Phase during their normal Draw, doubling the number of Normal Summons they can perform each turn, and doubling the battle damage inflicted to their opponent by their monsters. However, they come at the cost of preventing their user from activating monster effects in the hand for the rest of the Duel, preventing the use of beneficial cards such as handtraps or combo pieces that activate in the hand. Due to each "Morganite" Spell Card only being useful once before all remaining copies no longer provide additional benefit, they additionally have effects in the Graveyard that allow them to banish themselves to grant additional effects, such as searching other "Morganite" cards or preventing the opponent from activating monster effects in response to the player's Normal Summons.
