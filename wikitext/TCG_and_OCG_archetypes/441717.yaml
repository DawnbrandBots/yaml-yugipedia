  "'''Zoodiac'''", known as "'''Twelve Beasts'''" ({{Ruby|十|じゅう}}{{Ruby|二|に}}{{Ruby|獣|しし}} ''Jūnishishi'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 4 [[EARTH]] [[Beast-Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Raging Tempest]]''.
  "[[Master Peace, the True Dracoslayer]]" and "[[True King Lithosagym, the Disaster]]" are related to this archetype, as seen in the artworks of "[[Zodiac Sign]]" and "[[Zoodiac Combo]]", respectively.
  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  The "Zoodiac" monsters are based on the [[wikipedia:Chinese zodiac#Signs|Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac]], with each monster being a slightly anthropomorphized version of their respective animal. Each monster also wears an oversized gauntlet on either their left or right forearm, with which they wield their own respective weapon, and a belt marked with the [[wikipedia:Earthly Branches|Earthly Branch]] corresponding to the zodiac animal.
  ===Etymology===
  The Japanese name of this archetype, ''Jūnishishi'' ({{Ruby|十|じゅう}}{{Ruby|二|に}}{{Ruby|獣|しし}}), is a pun on ''Jūnishi'' (十二支), which refers to the twelve signs of the Chinese zodiac, and ''Shishi'' (獣), meaning "beast". Its English name, "Zoodiac", is a portmanteau of the words "zoo" and "zodiac".

  ==Playing style==
  The "Zoodiac" archetype is focused on performing [[Xyz Summon]]s with 1 card. All "Zoodiac" [[Xyz Monster]]s share the [[Summoning condition]] that, [[once per turn]], they can be Xyz Summoned using any "Zoodiac" monster the player [[control]]s with a different name.
  The archetype has six [[Main Deck]] monsters and six Xyz Monsters. Each "Zoodiac" Main Deck monster has an individual effect, and grants an additional effect for any [[Beast-Warrior]] Xyz Monster they are [[attach]]ed to as [[material]].

  |-
  | [[Zoodiac Ratpier|Ratpier]]
  | If Normal Summoned: Send 1 "Zoodiac" card from Deck to GY.
  | [[Once per turn]], detach 1 material; [[Special Summon]] 1 "Ratpier" from the [[hand]] or [[Deck]].
  |}
  The individual effects of the "Zoodiac" Main Deck monsters enable indirect monster searching, hand fixing, and GY recovery (for "Kataroost", "Bunnyblast", and "Ramram") if they are combined with card-destroying effects (which the archetype has through "[[Zoodiac Barrage]]" and "[[Zoodiac Drident]]"). Their applied effects grant effect protection, combat support, and monster swarming (for "Ratpier").
  "Zoodiac" Xyz Monsters all possess variable (?) [[ATK]]/[[DEF]], and gain ATK/DEF equal to the ATK/DEF of the "Zoodiac" monsters attached to them as [[Xyz Material]]s.

  |}
  The archetype's strength lies in its ability to perform consistent and powerful 1-card [[Extra Deck]] plays off of any single [[Main Deck]] "Zoodiac" monster. Any Main Deck "Zoodiac" monster or "Zoodiac" searcher (e.g. "[[Zoodiac Barrage]]", "[[Fire Formation - Tenki]]", "[[Speedroid Terrortop]]" 1-card "[[M-X-Saber Invoker]]" engine) provided immediate access to monster searching via "Broadbull", disruption via "Drident", and conditional monster revival via "Chakanine". Simply going through the effects of "Broadbull", "Drident", and "Chakanine" with any 1 Main Deck "Zoodiac" monster provided a +3 in card advantage.
  When "Ratpier" was [[Unlimited]], getting access to it also provided monster [[swarm]]ing as its applied effect could be used on two different "Zoodiac" [[Xyz Monster]]s to Summon 2 more copies of "Ratpier" from the Deck. Going through 3 copies of "Ratpier" and the aformentioned "Zoodiac" Extra Deck monsters provided a +5 in card advantage in one turn, off of a single copy of "Ratpier".
  The archetype lends itself to a control-based playstyle. Typically, "Zoodiac" Decks take advantage of the archetype's ability to perform consistent 1-card plays and dedicate most of their space to [[staple]] cards like [[hand trap]]s instead.
  Due to the power offered by its 1-card plays, the consistency provided by "Zoodiac" searchers, and its compact Main Deck requirements, "Zoodiac" at its peak power formed a powerful 1-card engine that can be splashed into many other Decks to provide card advantage, swarming, and disruptions (via "Drident").
  The archetype's Xyz Monsters have generic [[material]] requirements. As such, "[[Zoodiac Chakanine]]", who requires the least number of generic [[Level]] 4 monsters as materials (2+), can be used in other Decks to Summon other "Zoodiac" Xyz monsters.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" can shut down this archetype's ability to perform its 1-card plays.
  * "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" is one of the greatest threat of the "Zoodiac" deck, as it can shut down any Xyz stacking play by itself. As the "Zoodiac" Xyz monsters has [[?]] ATK/DEF, a "[[Primal Being Token]]" generated by "Nibiru" will have 0 ATK/DEF provided if there are no other monster(s) on the field, rendering the player vulnerable to opponent's counterattack if they cannot find a way to get rid of the Token soon enough.
