  "'''Dracoslayer'''" ({{Ruby|竜|りゅう}}{{Ruby|剣|けん}}{{Ruby|士|し}} ''Ryūkenshi'') is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[Dragon]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Clash of Rebellions]]''. The prominent members are all [[Extra Deck]] monsters that share a connection to other Pendulum-based archetypes that debuted in the same set as themselves. The remaining "Dracoslayers" are [[Pendulum Monster]]s that are the basis for Summoning the Extra Deck monsters.

  == Lore ==
  The [[Dracoverlord]] conquered the entire world with his army of Dracofiends, using Dragon Alchemy to turn all life into his terrible minions. At some point after this, "[[Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer]]" lost his memories and was cursed to have powers similar to the Dracofiends. Believing Dragon Alchemy to hold the key to breaking his curse and unlocking his memories, the Dracoslayer continues his journey and resolves to fight the evils of the Dracoverlord.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  All "Dracoslayer" monsters have two-word name with a title following them. In all of these names, the first word always has the syllable "''ster''" (スター ''sutā'') as their second half, and the Extra Deck "Dracoslayer" monsters have the first syllables of their corresponding archetypes' names as the first half of the word. The second word always starts with "P".
  In Japanese, the second word in the "Dracoslayer" monsters' two-word names is written in the form of a single Latin character (the first character of the word), with the full word reading being applied to it as furigana. For example, the name "Luster Pendulum" is written as ラスター{{Ruby|Ｐ|ペンデュラム}} (''Rasutā Pendyuramu'') in Japanese. Related to this, a large number of cards within the "Dracoslayer" storyline, in particular the ones associated with the "Dracoslayer" and "[[Dracoverlord]]" archetypes, their associated story Field Spells, and the "[[True Draco|True King / True Draco]]" archetypes, contain such examples of stylized words in their Japanese names.

  === Members ===
  {{See also|Dracoverlord}}
  The archetype, viewed together with the "[[Dracoverlord]]" archetype, can be divided into three sub-series and one standalone monster:
  * The [[Pendulum Monster]] forms of "[[Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer]]" and "[[Vector Pendulum, the Dracoverlord]]", depicting their standard forms
  * The Extra Deck/Ritual [[Special Summon Monster]] forms of "Luster Pendulum" and "Vector Pendulum", depicting their evolved forms
  * "[[Master Peace, the True Dracoslayer]]"
  * Three monsters visually related to "[[True Draco]]" monsters released in ''[[Darkwing Blast]]''
  The archetype and its related archetypes all feature a thematic emphasis on [[Field Spell Card]]s. Each of these Field Spells depict interactions between characters within the storyline, often between multiple archetypes.

  ==== Standard Pendulum Monsters ====
  Within these "Dracoslayer" and "Dracoverlord" cards, both archetypes feature 1 [[Normal Pendulum Monster|Pendulum Normal Monster]] with the [[Pendulum Scale]] of 3, and 1 [[Pendulum Monster|Pendulum Effect Monster]] with the Pendulum Scale of 5.

  == Playing style ==
  This Deck's main monster is "[[Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer]]", a Pendulum Tuner Monster that can only be used to Summon its [[Ignister Prominence, the Blasting Dracoslayer|Synchro]], [[Majester Paladin, the Ascending Dracoslayer|Xyz]], and [[Dinoster Power, the Mighty Dracoslayer|Fusion]] counterparts. Each of these monsters can Special Summon another "Dracoslayer" Pendulum Monster to the field to Special Summon a different counterpart. This allows for rapid Special Summoning of powerful monsters that each can return cards to the Deck, protect Pendulum Scales, and search for any Pendulum Monster from the Main Deck respectively.
  As "Luster Pendulum" tends to utilize many monsters as Materials to Summon its stronger forms, it is recommended to use recycling cards such as "[[Jar of Avarice]]", "[[Pot of Riches]]", and "[[Daigusto Emeral]]" to keep the Summons going.
  "[[Master Pendulum, the Dracoslayer]]", unlike its Tuner counterpart, is not restricted to "Dracoslayer" Extra Deck Monsters only and can be recovered by their effects to fuel any Extra Deck Summon. "[[Draco Face-Off]]" is great for loading the Extra Deck with Pendulum Monsters early in the game, but becomes a dead draw as the game drags on.

  == Trivia ==
  * The Dracoslayers have some similarities to both the "[[D/D]]" and "[[Odd-Eyes]]" archetypes.
  ** All three archetypes use Pendulum Monsters as a catalyst to summon powerful monsters.
  ** They each have a trio of Extra Deck Monsters with the attributes of [[FIRE]], [[WIND]], and [[WATER]].
