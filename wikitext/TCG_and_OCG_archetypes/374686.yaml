  "'''Power Tool'''" (パワー・ツール, ''Pawā Tsūru'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Machine]] [[Synchro Monster]]s used by [[Leo]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (manga)|manga]]. Their effects revolve around the usage of [[Equip Spell Card]]s.

  The only 3 members of the archetype are "[[Power Tool Dragon]]", "[[Power Tool Mecha Dragon]]", and "[[Power Tool Braver Dragon]]". They are supported by "[[Ultimaya Tzolkin]]" and "[[Duel Link Dragon, the Duel Dragon]]", which use this archetype to support most of the [[Duel Dragon]]s and all of the [[Signer Dragon]]s.

  This archetype is also related to the "[[Morphtronic]]" archetype, which is also used by Leo, although "[[Double Tool C&D]]" is the only support card they explicitly share. "Morphtronic" cards' effects can be used to easily Synchro Summon "Power Tool" monsters and support them after they are on the field.
