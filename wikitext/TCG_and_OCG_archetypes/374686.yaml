  "'''Power Tool'''" (パワー・ツール, ''Pawā Tsūru'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Machine]] [[Synchro Monster]]s used by [[Leo]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (manga)|manga]]. Their effects revolve around the usage of [[Equip Spell Card]]s.

  The three members of the archetype are "[[Power Tool Dragon]]" and two of its variants, "[[Power Tool Mecha Dragon]]" and "[[Power Tool Braver Dragon]]". This archetype is related to the "[[Morphtronic]]" archetype, which is also used by Leo, although "[[Double Tool C&D]]" is the only support card they explicitly share. "Morphtronic" cards' effects can be used to easily Synchro Summon "Power Tool" monsters and support them after they are on the field.

  This archetype is the result of these monsters being  [[Machine]]s rather than [[Dragon]]s, unlike their counterparts belonging to the other [[Signer]]s. Consequently, cards which support [[Duel Dragons]] or [[Signer Dragons]] as a group (such as "[[Ultimaya Tzolkin]]" and "[[Duel Link Dragon, the Duel Dragon]]") cannot simply support Level 7 and 8 Dragon Synchro Monsters without a clause that also includes "Power-Tool" monsters, lest Leo's cards be excluded.

  == Design ==
  Members of this archetype are cyborgs or robots shaped like Western-style dragons, with exoskeletons of yellow metal and red electric lights on their bodies, which also take the place of their eyes. The power tools they are named for are equipped to or replace their arms, which matches their in-game playstyle.

  == Playstyle ==
  Although intended to be used alongside "Morphtronic" cards, "Power Tool" monsters have entirely generic material requirements, and as such can be slotted into any Synchro Summoning strategy of choice, though their effects are only useful in Decks that utilize Equip Spells.

  == Trivia ==
  * [[Life Stream Dragon]] represents the same monster, having surpassed its limits and become a true, organic Dragon. Though not a "Power Tool" monster by name any longer, since its a Dragon Synchro Monster of appropriate level, it shares the same Signer Dragon and Duel Dragon support.
