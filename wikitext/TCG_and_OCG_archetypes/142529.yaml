  "'''Aesir'''", known as "'''Polar God'''" ({{Ruby|極|きょく}}{{Ruby|神|しん}}, ''Kyokushin'') in the ''OCG'', is an [[archetype]] of three mysterious deity-like [[Synchro Monster]]s used by [[Team Ragnarok]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]''. They are nicknamed the '''Three Polar Gods of the Star World''' ({{Ruby|星|せい}}{{Ruby|界|かい}}の{{Ruby|三|さん}}{{Ruby|極|きょく}}{{Ruby|神|しん}}, ''Seikai no Sankyokushin'') in the Japanese anime, and the '''Nordic God''' cards or the '''Polar Star Gods''' in the dubbed version, despite not being part of the "[[Nordic]]" archetype (though they are related).

  In the anime, the "Aesir" monsters are [[DIVINE]] [[Divine-Beast]] monsters. They are the only Synchro Monsters that are either DIVINE or Divine-Beast in any media. However, their [[Attribute]]s and [[Type]]s were changed in the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'': [[EARTH]] [[Beast-Warrior]] for "[[Thor, Lord of the Aesir|Thor]]", [[DARK]] [[Spellcaster]] for "[[Loki, Lord of the Aesir|Loki]]", and [[LIGHT]] [[Fairy]] for "[[Odin, Father of the Aesir|Odin]]".

  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, the three Nordic God cards were found by three Duelists, who would then possess the [[Rune Eye]]s. Each card was found within a cave dominated by a shrine made of tree roots, ostensibly in reference to the "World Tree" [[Wikipedia:Yggdrasil|Yggdrasil]], which connects the [[wikipedia:Norse cosmology|Nine Realms]] of Norse mythology. Among the Nine Realms are [[wikipedia:Asgard|Asgard]], land of the Æsir, and [[wikipedia:Midgard|Midgard]], home of humans and another name for Earth; thus, these shrines may symbolize a connection to Asgard itself, hence the power of the Nordic God cards.

  The powers of these Gods resonate with that of the [[Crimson Dragon]]. When "[[Thor, Lord of the Aesir (anime)|Thor]]" clashed with "[[Red Dragon Archfiend (anime)|Red Dragon Archfiend]]", both [[Monster Card|monsters]] emitted a strange energy pulse, wreaking havoc around the Dueling arena and drastically upsetting the weather outside the stadium.<ref name="ep118">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's|118|ref}}</ref> When [[Jack Atlas]] used [[Blazing Soul]] to combine "Red Dragon Archfiend" with [[Red Nova]], the strongest [[Earthbound Immortal]], the resulting "[[Red Nova Dragon (anime)|Red Nova Dragon]]" was stated to rival "Thor" in power.<ref name="ep125">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's|125|ref}}</ref> During [[Team Ragnarok]]'s match against [[Team 5D's]], the attacks of the Nordic Gods dealt real damage to Jack and [[Crow Hogan|Crow]].

  When the [[Divine Temple]] appeared, the Nordic Gods protected Team Ragnarok and their [[Duel Runner]]s from the Divine Temple's negative [[Ener-D]].<ref name="ep137">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's|137|ref}}</ref> Team Ragnarok used the Nordic Gods and the old Ener-D reactor to create the "[[Rainbow Bridge Bifrost (5D's)|Bifrost]]" to extend the [[Daedalus Bridge]] and send Team 5D's to the Divine Temple.

  == Design ==
  The three "Aesir" monsters are named for the most prominent among the [[wikipedia:Æsir|Æsir]] of [[wikipedia:Norse mythology|Norse mythology]]: [[wikipedia:Odin|Odin]], the so-called Allfather and king of the Æsir; [[wikipedia:Thor|Thor]], known as the god of thunder and strongest among the gods; and [[wikipedia:Loki|Loki]], a notorious trickster and [[wikipedia:Jötunn|Jötunn]] who was usually associated with the Aesir until orchestrating the death of [[wikipedia:Baldr|Baldr]], for which he was tied to a stone as punishment until [[wikipedia:Ragnarök|Ragnarök]], the end of the world.
  The term “Polar God” could refer to the Scandinavian origins of Norse myths, as the region stretches up to the Arctic Circle and therefore towards the North Pole.
  Notably, while the term “Æsir” is usually spelled with the letter [[wikipedia:Æ|ash (Æ/æ)]], the TCG spells it “Aesir,” likely for familiarity with an audience that largely doesn’t use said character, being most common in Scandinavian languages like Danish and Norwegian.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Aesir" Deck is focused on Synchro Summoning "[[Odin, Father of the Aesir|Odin]]", "[[Loki, Lord of the Aesir|Loki]]" and/or "[[Thor, Lord of the Aesir|Thor]]" using the "[[Nordic]]" monsters, and use  "[[Nordic Relic]]" support cards to control the field.
  Each of the three "Aesir" monster is Level 10, and requires 1 [[Tuner]] from their associated "Nordic" sub-archetype and two non-Tuner monsters to be Synchro Summoned. While historical "Aesir" decks relied on using individual Tuners from each of the "Nordic" sub-archetypes or "[[Vanadis of the Nordic Ascendant]]", the current main "Nordic" Tuner is "[[Nordic Beast Gullinbursti]]", who can be used to Synchro Summon any of the "Aesir" monsters, and can provide easily accessible advantage on the field.
  The "Aesir" monsters on-field effects that either negate cards or in Odin's case make itself unaffected by Spells or Traps, as well as a self-revival effect that activates in the [[End Phase]]. All 3 have over 3000 [[ATK]] and are required to get the most out of the Deck's Traps. "[[Divine Relic Mjollnir|Mjollnir]]" and "[[Nordic Relic Megingjord|Megingjord]]" effectively double the power output of the "Aesirs" while "[[Nordic Relic Svalinn|Svalinn]]" allows the player to negate cards off-turn and without "Thor" or revive an Aesir from the [[Graveyard]]. "[[March Towards Ragnarok]]" is an "Aesir" support [[Quick-Play Spell Card]] that makes the targeted "Aesir" unaffected by Spells and Traps but negates their Effects.
  In order to quickly access the "Nordic" Tuners and non-Tuner monsters for Synchro Summoning, the Deck heavily relies on the effect of its Link 1 monster, "[[Gullveig of the Nordic Ascendant]]". "Gullveig", once Link summoned, can banish up to 3 cards from the player's hand or field to Special Summon that many "Nordic" monsters from the Deck, but locks the player into only summoning "Aesir" monsters for the rest of the turn. "Gullveig" can easily set up the summon of an "Aesir" by itself; its heavy banish requirement is typically circumvented with cards like "[[Hippo Carnival]]", since it banishes only at resolution. Other card advantage-generating engines are also useful for mitigating the costs of "Gullveig".
  "Gullveig" also provides protection to "Aesir" monsters it points to, making them harder to remove.
  Aside from their Tuner monsters, other notable "Nordic" monsters include:
  * "[[Nordic Smith Ivaldi]]", who is a free extender from hand, and can search "Nordic Relic" cards.
  * "[[Tanngrisnir of the Nordic Beasts]]", who summons two Level 3 [[Token]]s if destroyed by battle.
  * "[[Tanngnjostr of the Nordic Beasts]]", who can conditionally [[Special Summon]] itself from the hand, and can summon another "Nordic Beast" monster from the Deck if it changes from Defense to Attack position.
  * "[[Dverg of the Nordic Alfar]]", who can recover "Nordic Relic" cards from the Graveyard.
  * "[[Alviss of the Nordic Alfar]]", who, if it is the only card banished by a "Nordic" Link Monster (i.e. "Gullveig"), it can perform a pseudo "1-card-Synchro" of any "Aesir" using 1 "Nordic" monster on the field and "Nordic" monsters from the Deck; it provides a less costly alternative to banishing 3 cards with "Gullveig" while still setting up the summon of an "Aesir". It also has a once per Duel GY effect to Special Summon a new "Aesir" from the [[Extra Deck]] when one is destroyed.
  Other notable "Nordic Relic" cards searchable by "Nordic Smith Ivaldi" include "[[Nordic Relic Gungnir|Gungnir]]", a card-destroying Trap, and "[[Nordic Relic Hlidskjalf|Hlidskjalf]]", a restrictive summon-from-Deck searcher that locks the player into "Aesir" monsters while the summoned monster is on the field, preventing the player from easily accessing "Gullveig".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "Gullveig" is the Deck's main playmaker, and is thus also its main chokepoint. Without "Gullveig", the Deck becomes much less consistent in performing its combos.
  * The deck can only consistently make "[[Nordic Relic Svalinn]]" as a disruption, making its end boards extremely predictable and relatively easy to play through.
  * The Deck's playstyle is directly countered by:
  ** Anti-Synchro floodgates (e.g. "[[Dimensional Barrier]]")
  ** Anti-Summoning floodgates (e.g. "[[Summon Limit]]", "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]")
  * "Gullveig" is directly countered by:
  ** Anti-banishing floodgates (e.g. "[[Artifact Lancea]]", "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]")
  * Anti-GY floodgate (e.g. "[[Macro Cosmos]]") can prevent the Deck from using its recovery options.

  == Trivia ==
  * In the anime, "[[Thor, Lord of the Aesir (anime)|Thor]]", "[[Loki, Lord of the Aesir (anime)|Loki]]", and "[[Odin, Father of the Aesir (anime)|Odin]]" glow cyan, magneta, and yellow respectively, though there is one flashback from {{episode|5D's|123|ref}} where they are instead colored to match their respective users' [[Rune Eye]]s.
