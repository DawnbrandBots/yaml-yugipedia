  }}
  "'''Cybernetic'''" (サイバネティック ''Saibanetikku'') is an [[archetype]] of cards related to [[Machine]] [[Fusion Monster]]s and the "[[Cyber Dragon (archetype)|Cyber Dragon]]" archetype. It is only [[support]]ed by "[[Cyber Dragon Core]]" and "[[Cybernetic Overflow]]".

  Although they are related to the "[[Cyber]]" archetype, and is treated as a subset of the "Cyber" archetype in the ''[[TCG]]'' (in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese) they are a separate group of cards. All support for the "Cyber" Spells/Traps also support the "Cybernetic" archetype, so the only time this would be an issue is if a "Cybernetic" monster is affected by a card like "[[DNA Surgery]]", since support for "Cyber" monsters only affects [[Dragon]] and [[Machine]] monsters, whereas no "Cybernetic" monster belongs to either of those [[Type]]s.
