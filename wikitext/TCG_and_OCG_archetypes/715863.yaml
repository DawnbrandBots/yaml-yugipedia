  {{Quote|The archetype's tagline in promotional material|Asking all of you<br />Let's go find the Melffies ♫}}
  "'''Melffy'''" (メルフィー ''Merufī'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Beast]] [[monster]]s, predominately [[EARTH]] [[Attribute]] and [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 2, introduced in ''[[Rise of the Duelist]]''.

  == Design ==
  [[File:Melffy-ConceptArt.png|thumb|left|200px|Concept art for several "Melffy" monsters]]
  The artworks of this archetype are drawn in a cartoonish style similar to children's story books. It also uses pastel color palettes.

  === Etymology ===
  The name of this archetype may be a portmanteau of "märchen" (メルヘン) and "fee" (フィー). Both words are German, with "märchen" meaning "fairy tale" and "fee" meaning "fairy". It may also be a pun on "fluffy". The Spells and Traps reference various [[wikipedia: List of children's games|children games]].

  === Appearance ===
  Every member of this archetype are based on various kinds of animal. "Melffy Mommy" is probably supposed to be the 'mother' of all Melffy, as shown in the artwork of "[[Melffy Playhouse]]", where "Mommy" appears to be gigantic and taking care of small Melffy monsters. All members have a heart pattern on their chest and a flower pattern on their thigh. All of the main deck monsters except "Melffy Rabby" have a combined ATK/DEF value of 400, while the extra deck monster except "Melffy Mommy" have combined value of 2500.

  === Monsters ===
  Among the [[Main Deck]] monsters, except "Melffy Rabby" and "Melffy Pinny", they all share the same second effect and much of the same first effect.

  Each of those Melffys first effect triggers when either an opponent [[Normal Summon|Normal]] or [[Special Summon]]s a monster or when the Melffy in question is [[Attack target|attacked]]. The Melffys are returned to the hand, and an unique effect, listed in the table below, is applied. These effects tend to add or Summon Beast monsters from various locations.

  Their second effect, meanwhile, allow the player to Special Summon the Melffys from the hand during the player's [[End Phase]]. The main purpose this serves is to allow the player to field their Main Deck Melffys in [[Defense Position]], as their [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] aren't geared for offense, while allowing them to be [[Face-up]] so that they can meet the trigger for their first effect as quickly and as much at the player's leisure as possible. Also, by allowing them to swarm the field during the End Phase, as opposed to the Main Phase, this design choice encourages Melffys to be played in a more [[Control Strategy|control-oriented style]].

  == Playing style ==
  "Melffy" is an archetype focused on [[Xyz Summon]]ing and disruption tactics. Every Main Deck "Melffy" monster can Special Summon themselves from the hand on the player's End Phase, and return themselves to the hand when attacked or if the opponent summons a monster, along with some other effect meant to generically support [[Beast]] monsters, such as adding them to the hand, special summoning them or recovering them from the graveyard.
  The Xyz Monsters of the archetype have effects based on having many [[Xyz Material]]s, with the Deck's boss monster, "Melffy Mommy" being able to be Xyz Summoned with many materials at once, and gaining powerful effects once it has 5 of them, turning it into essentially a Beast "[[Yubel]]". It's very defensive in nature and stronger in grind games, attempting to gather as many resources as it can for a big attack at the end, mainly through the trap "[[Melffy Playhouse]]", which can return most of your opponent's field to the hand and increase your Xyz Monsters' ATK to ludicrous levels for a final OTK.

  "[[Melffy Pinny]]" is a good tech option within the archetype's theme, able to Summon itself as a Quick Effect provided a fellow "Melffy" monster was returned to the hand that turn. After which, it can [[Synchro Summon]] using itself and fellow "Melffy" in hand. The obvious choice to go into being "[[Merry Melffys]]" for its on-Summon [[Returns from field to hand|bounce effect]] and subsequent Summon/enabling of "[[Joyous Melffys]]", but also a toolbox including (but not limited to) "[[Herald of the Arc Light]]", "[[Desert Locusts]]", "[[PSY-Framelord Omega]]", and "[[Adamancipator Risen - Dragite]]" for additional interaction. Aside from this, "Pinny" has a second effect in the GY to attach itself to a Beast Xyz monster, which can enable the bounce effect of "Playhouse".

  The archetype has great synergy with "[[Spright]]" given its enabling of Level/Rank/Link-2 monsters, as well as "[[Nimble]]" which often goes hand-in-hand with both aforementioned archetypes. Not only do both provide extra Level 2 bodies with which to extend into [[Xyz Summon|Xyz]] and [[Link Summon]]s with, but also additional disruption such as "[[Spright Double Cross|Double Cross]]" and "[[Spright Smashers|Smashers]]" which do not necessarily require "Spright" monsters to utilize.

  Infamously, the archetype has great ease Summoning and utilizing "[[Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder]]" to act as high-stat protection and a Quick Effect board wipe. Not only can "Melffy" potentially steer clear of the possible loss by returning their monsters to the hand, but given their common Level of 2 they can easily form "ZEUS" by overlaying into a battle-protected generic Rank 2 such as "[[Sky Cavalry Centaurea]]" or "[[Number 2: Ninja Shadow Mosquito]]", and subsequently after battling promoting either into "[[Downerd Magician]]" which will then become a "ZEUS" with four total [[Xyz Material]] to enable use of its effect twice.
