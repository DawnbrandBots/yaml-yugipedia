  }}
  "'''Dark Magician Girl'''", known as "'''Black Magician Girl'''" (ブラック・マジシャン・ガール ''Burakku Majishan Gāru'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is both an [[archetype]] and a sub-archetype of the "[[Dark Magician (archetype)|Dark Magician]]" and "[[Magician Girl]]" archetypes. They are all based on "[[Dark Magician Girl]]". It is only supported by the [[Spell Card]] "[[Dark Burning Attack]]".

  == Name ==
  The effect of "[[The Eye of Timaeus]]" can affect any "Dark Magician" monster, including "Dark Magician Girl" monsters.
  * In German, Portuguese, and Spanish, due to gender-specific conjugation, the [[card text]] compounds the "Dark Magician" and "Dark Magician Girl" into a single string („Dunkler/s Magier“, "Mago(a) Negro(a)", and "Mago/a Oscuro/a", respectively) to explicitly include "Dark Magician Girl" monsters as being part of the archetype.
  * In Italian, despite also conjugating based on gender, card text often treats names that only differ due to conjugation as the same entity, so the Italian text of "The Eye of Timaeus" only lists the name of "Dark Magician" ("Mago Nero"), with support for "Dark Magician Girl" ("Ragazza Maga Nera") monsters being implicit.
  * In French, due to the inconsolable difference in names between the two monsters, the effect of "The Eye of Timaeus" supports both the "Dark Magician" archetype ("Magicien Sombre") and the "Dark Magician Girl" archetype ("Magicienne des Ténèbres") separately.
