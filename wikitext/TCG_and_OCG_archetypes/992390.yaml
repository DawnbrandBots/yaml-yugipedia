  "'''Snake-Eye'''" (スネークアイ ''Sunēkuai'') is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] monsters introduced in ''[[Duelist Nexus]]'', before receiving direct support in the next set ''[[Age of Overlord]]''.

  This archetype is related to the "[[Diabellstar]]" and "[[Sinful Spoils]]" archetypes.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#No. 15: The Hidden Sinful Spoils|The Valuable Book EX 5 card storylines#No. 1: Witch of the White Forest}}

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The name of the theme is derived from the [[wikipedia:snake eyes|snake eyes]]—a roll of two dice, with both resulting in one—represented in the theme through its Level 1 monsters, while also being an allusion to the eye-like gem appearing in all of their artworks ("[[Sinful Spoils of Subversion - Snake-Eye]]").

  The individual names of the Level 1 monsters are inspired by the Lithuanian tale of [[wikipedia:Eglė the Queen of Serpents|Eglė the Queen of Serpents]], in which the Serpent Queen's children were transformed into [[Snake-Eye Oak|oak]], [[Snake-Eye Ash|ash]], [[Snake-Eye Birch|birch]], and [[Snake-Eyes Poplar|aspen]] trees.

  === Appearance ===
  "Snake-Eye" monsters share the common element of a glowing red eye gem surrounded by colored flames and some kind of rock-like material to form their main body.

  == Playing style ==
  "Snake-Eye" is a theme of mostly [[Level 1]] FIRE Pyro monsters, focused around placing monsters in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] as [[Continuous Spell Card]]s, then either using them for [[cost]]s for their effects, or Special Summoning them. The archetype is generally played as a [[Link]]-heavy combo Deck.

  The Level 1 monsters all have an advantage-giving effect, and each one (except "[[Snake-Eyes Poplar]]") can send itself and another face-up cards to the GY to summon another member of the archetype. The main boss of the theme is "[[Snake-Eyes Flamberge Dragon]]", which can place a monster from either GY to its owner's Spell & Trap Zone, and on the opposing turn, can Special Summon a monster from either S/T Zone to the controller's field. When it is sent to the GY, it can summon two Level 1 FIRE monsters from the GY.

  Supporting Spells & Traps include:
  * "[[Sinful Spoils of Subversion - Snake-Eye|Sinful Spoils of Subversion]]" places 1 monster into the Spell & Trap Zone, acting as generic removal that can be searched by the archetype.
  * "[[Divine Temple of the Snake-Eye]]" places a monster from GY to the Spell & Trap Zone, and can Special Summon a monster treated as a Continuous Spell on the opponent's turn.
  * "[[Original Sinful Spoils - Snake-Eye|Original Sinful Spoils]]" (''OCG'' / Traditional Format) sends 1 face-up card to the GY to Special Summon a Level 1 FIRE monster.
  * "[[Startling Stare of the Snake-Eyes]]" is a trap that can either place a monster into the Spell & Trap Zone or summon one from there, but requires the player to control 2+ Levels of "Snake-Eye" monsters to activate.

  === External Support ===
  The theme benefits heavily from: 
  * Various Level 1, FIRE, and Pyro support cards, such as "[[Bonfire]]", "[[One for One]]", and "[[Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames]]". Less often played cards include "[[Flametongue the Burning Blade]]" and the "[[Volcanic]]" support from ''[[Duelist Pack: Duelists of Explosion]]. 
  ** The "[[Fire King]]" support released in ''[[Structure Deck: Fire Kings]]''. 
  ** With the same summon condition as "Snake-Eyes Poplar", "[[Agnimal Candle]]" allows for the deck to make Synchro plays, such as summoning "[[Snake-Eyes Vengeance Dragon]]" through it and one of the many Level 8 monsters played in "Snake-Eye".
  * "[[Azamina]]", another "[[Sinful Spoils]]"-related archetype that can search "Original Sinful Spoils" while getting an omni-negate on field.
  * The "[[Fiendsmith]]" cards, which can efficiently bridge with "Snake-Eye" and vice-versa, allowing for a consistent strategy.
  * By including Level 4 monsters, such as "[[Summoner Monk]]" or "[[Surfacing Big Jaws]]" with "[[Drake Shark]]", "[[Infernal Flame Banshee]]" can be used to search (and thus summon in the case of "Poplar") key Snake-Eye cards. Additionally, "Banshee" can be summoned without the use of the Normal Summon via "[[Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi]]" and it's standard package.
  * "[[Millennium]]" cards can be used to easily get monsters as Continuous Spells on to your side of the field, setting up for the summon of "[[Snake-Eyes Doomed Dragon]]" as well as the potential of [[Rank 8 Monster Cards|Rank 8]] monsters by extension.
  * The "[[Centur-Ion]]" cards can provide the deck easy access to the materials required to summon either "Snake-Eyes Doomed Dragon" or "Snake-Eyes Vengeance Dragon", while also providing a negate in the form of "[[Centur-Ion True Awakening]]".

  ===Sample combo===
  The "Snake-Eye" strategy can get going by simply [[Summon]]ing "[[Snake-Eye Ash]]", whether by [[Normal Summon]] or a card that can [[Special Summon]] it from elsewhere (i.e. "[[Original Sinful Spoils - Snake-Eye]]" or "[[One for One]]").

  The below combo focuses on setting up several points of interaction, as well as follow-up plays from "Ash" and "[[Snake-Eye Oak]]" after "[[Snake-Eyes Flamberge Dragon]]" is sent to the GY. It is capable of playing through "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]", as it would only prevent "[[Snake-Eyes Poplar]]" from searching for a "Snake-Eye" Spell/Trap after "Ash" searches for it.

  # Placing "[[I:P Masquerena]]" in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] with "[[Snake-Eyes Flamberge Dragon]]" so "Flamberge Dragon" can Special Summon it during the opponent's turn for a Link Summon (usually "[[Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess]]" for monster negates or "[[S:P Little Knight]]" for monster removal).
  # "[[Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames]]" in the GY to destroy one of the player's FIRE monsters and one of the opponent's monsters to Special Summon itself after the opponent Summons a monster. 
  # "[[Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale]]" can act as both follow-up and removal, which can be triggered by the effect of "Promethean Princess".

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Snake-Eye Ash]]"
  | end     = "[[Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale]]" and "[[Snake-Eyes Flamberge Dragon]]" in the Monster Zones + "[[I:P Masquerena]]" in the Spell & Trap Zone + "[[Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames]]" in the GY
  | steps   = 
  # Summon "[[Snake-Eye Ash]]".
  # Activate "Ash" to search for "[[Snake-Eyes Poplar]]".
  # Activate "Poplar" to Special Summon itself.
  # Activate "Poplar" to search for any "Snake-Eye" Spell/Trap.
  # [[Link Summon]] "[[Linkuriboh]]" using "Poplar"
  # Activate "Poplar" to place itself in the Spell & Trap Zone.
  # Activate "Ash" to send itself and "Poplar" to the [[Graveyard|GY]] to Special Summon "[[Snake-Eye Oak]]".
  # Activate "Oak" to Special Summon "Ash" or "Poplar" from the GY.
  # Activate "Oak" to send itself and "Linkuriboh" to the GY to Special Summon "[[Snake-Eyes Flamberge Dragon]]".
  # Link Summon "[[I:P Masquerena]]" using "Flamberge Dragon" and the monster "Oak" Special Summoned earlier.
  # Activate "Flamberge Dragon" to Special Summon two of "Oak", "Ash", or "Poplar" from the GY.
  # Link Summon "[[Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames]]" using "Masquerena" and one of the Level 1 monsters.
  # Activate "Promethean Princess" to Special Summon "Flamberge Dragon" from the GY.
  # Activate "Flamberge Dragon" to place "Masquerena" from the GY to the Spell & Trap Zone.
  # Link Summon "[[Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale]]" using "Promethean Princess" and the other Level 1 monster.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Due to the archetype being reliant on using [[Graveyard]] to recur resources and facilitate grind game, anti-GY floodgates such as "[[Necrovalley]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]", or "[[Dimension Shifter]]" can stop most of the grind game the deck has to offer.
  * As the Deck is focused on monster interruption and mostly lacks interaction with [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]] unless using external staples, the deck is ironically weak against [[Chain Burn]] Decks that can easily exploit the Deck's swarming capabilities to deal game-ending damage in a single turn with cards such as "[[Ceasefire]]" or "[[Just Desserts]]".
