  "'''Snake-Eye'''" (スネークアイ ''Sunēkuai'') is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] monsters introduced in ''[[Duelist Nexus]]'', before receiving direct support in the next set ''[[Age of Overlord]]''.

  This archetype is related to the "[[Diabellstar]]" and "[[Sinful Spoils]]" archetypes.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The name of the theme is derived from the [[wikipedia:snake eyes|snake eyes]]—a roll of two dice, with both resulting in one—represented in the theme through its Level 1 monsters, while also being an allusion to the eye-like gem appearing in all of their artworks ("[[Sinful Spoils of Subversion - Snake-Eye]]").

  The individual names of the Level 1 monsters are inspired by the Lithuanian tale of [[wikipedia:Eglė the Queen of Serpents|Eglė the Queen of Serpents]], in which the Serpent Queen's children were transformed into [[Snake-Eye Oak|oak]], [[Snake-Eye Ash|ash]], [[Snake-Eye Birch|birch]], and [[Snake-Eyes Poplar|aspen]] trees.

  === Appearance ===
  "Snake-Eye" monsters share the common element of a glowing red eye gem surrounded by colored flames and some kind of rock-like material to form their main body.

  == Playing style ==

  "Snake-Eye" is a theme focused around [[Level]] 1 FIRE monsters and [[Special Summon]]ing monsters from the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] treated as [[Continuous Spell Card]]s. The bulk of its monster line-up is made of Level 1 FIRE [[Pyro]] monsters that feature various consistency effects as well as a shared effect to send themselves and another card the player controls to Special Summon a "Snake-Eye" monster from the hand or Deck, excluding that respective card. The boss of the theme is "[[Snake-Eyes Flamberge Dragon]]", a Level 8 FIRE [[Dragon]] monster able to place any monster on the field or in either [[Graveyard|GY]] on the field as a Continuous Spell Card to its owner's field. On top of this, during the opponent's turn, it is able to take a monster treated as a Continuous Spell and Special Summon it to the field of its controller, leading to passive snatching of the opponent's stronger monsters.

  The theme is supported by three [[Spell Card]]s and one [[Trap Card]] primarily. The original card for the theme, "[[Sinful Spoils of Subversion - Snake-Eye]]", is a basic Spell Card able to place a monster on either side of the field to the Spell & Trap Zone as a Continuous Spell. The [[Field Spell Card]], "[[Divine Temple of the Snake-Eye]]", places a "Snake-Eye" monster onto the field as a Continuous Spell from hand, Deck, or GY, gives all Level 1 FIRE monsters a sizable stat gain of 1100 ATK, and is able to Special Summon a monster treated as a Continuous Spell to your field once per turn when the opponent Normal or Special Summons a monster. As well, the final Spell Card, "[[Original Sinful Spoils - Snake-Eye]]", is able to summon any Level 1 FIRE monster from the hand or Deck and also can banish itself to add any Level 1 FIRE monster from the Deck to the hand at the added cost of placing a "Snake-Eye" or "[[Diabellstar]]" monster at the bottom of the deck, cementing a further connection between the two themes. The Trap Card of the theme, "[[Startling Stare of the Snake-Eyes]]", does much of the same things the rest of the theme can do such as placing monsters in the backrow and Special Summoning them back, but the user needs to have "Snake-Eye" monsters on the field whose Levels total to 2 or more.

  The theme benefits immensely from various Level 1, FIRE, and Pyro support cards, such as "[[Bonfire]]", "[[One for One]]", as well as the wave of "[[Volcanic]]" support from ''[[Duelist Pack: Duelists of Explosion]]''. "[[Kurikara Divincarnate]]", a powerful [[board breaker]], can be easily searched by both "[[Snake-Eye Ash]]" the GY effect of "Original Sinful Spoils - Snake-Eye". For another card that supports the theme well, there is the [[Link Monster|LINK]]-2 monster "[[Flametongue the Blazing Magical Blade]]", which protects the owner's face-up Spells/Traps as well as adding banished FIRE monsters back to the hand.
