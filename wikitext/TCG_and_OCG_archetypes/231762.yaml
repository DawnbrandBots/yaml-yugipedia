  "'''Fire Formation'''", known as "'''Flame Dance'''" ({{Ruby|炎|えん}}{{Ruby|舞|ぶ}} ''Enbu'') in the OCG, is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s first introduced in ''[[Cosmo Blazer]]''. They are named after the seven stars of the [[wikipedia:Big Dipper|Big Dipper]]. 
  "Fire Formation" cards are focused around supporting [[Beast-Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They are supported by the "[[Fire Fist]]" archetype, which consists of Beast-Warrior monsters. Their connection is also shown in the artworks of the "Fire Formation" cards, since 2 different members of the "[[Fire Fist]]" archetype are shown in each.
  So far, all of the continuous "Fire Formation" cards have two effects. They have one effect that can be used once while it is on the field (in the same way as a Normal Spell or Trap) and the same continuous effect that gives all of your face-up Beast-Warrior monsters 100 [[ATK]] (Spells) or 300 ATK (Traps). Their effects can also be seen as mirroring the effects of other Spell and Trap Cards.

  ==Trivia==
