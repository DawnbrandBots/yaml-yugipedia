  "'''Utopia'''", known as "'''King of Wishes, Hope'''" ({{Ruby|希|き}}{{Ruby|望|ぼう}}{{Ruby|皇|おう}}ホープ ''Kibōō Hōpu'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] associated with the "[[Number]]" archetype. It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Utopic]]" archetype. They are used by [[Yuma Tsukumo]] and [[Astral]] as their [[signature card]]s in the anime, and are [[support]]ed by cards in the "[[ZW -]]" archetype. They are also used by [[Master Evil]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL]] manga.
  In the Japanese version, "[[Utopian Aura]]", "[[Utopia Buster]]" and "[[Draco-Utopian Aura]]" are not members of this archetype, as they do not have 「{{Ruby|希|き}}{{Ruby|望|ぼう}}{{Ruby|皇|おう}}ホープ」 in their Japanese names.

  ==Playing style==
  Aside from "[[Number 39: Utopia]]" itself, the monsters have effects which either increase their own [[ATK]] or deal with the ATK of the opponent's monsters.
  A Utopia Deck usually focuses on [[Xyz Summon]]ing "Utopia" monsters. The base form [[negate]]s attacks, and the "[[Number C39]]", [[Rank-Down]], and [[Rank-Up]] versions focus on [[This card gains ATK|gaining ATK]] and [[Your opponent's monsters lose ATK|draining opposing monsters' ATK]]. The alternate "Utopia" forms can be easy summoned by most "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" cards and "[[Rank-Down-Magic Numeron Fall]]". This archetype works well with "[[Number Wall]]", "[[Onomatopia]]", and the "[[ZW -]]" archetype.
  Two great [[Xyz Monster]]s that can support this archetype are "[[Number 99: Utopic Dragon]]" and "[[CXyz Barian Hope]]". The former can be easily summoned to the field by simply discarding a "Rank-Up-Magic" card and using a "Utopia" monster as [[Xyz Material]]. "Barian Hope" can be [[Xyz Summon]]ed by "[[Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force]]". It is capable of using the effects of "Utopia" monsters in the [[Graveyard]].

  With the release of ''[[Duelist's Advance]]'', the Deck has been greatly strengthened. The new "[[Onomat]]" cards serve as starters and extenders for the Deck, while "[[Number F0: Utopic Future Zexal]]" and "[[Unbreakable Xyz Barrier]]" strengthen the end board.

  ===Sample Combos===
  Below is a sample 1-card combo.

  {{Combo steps

  }}

  There are several variants of the above combo. For instance, it is possible to end with "Number S39: Utopia Prime" on the field as well. However, the player will not be able to take control of a monster with the effect of "Utopic Future Zexal" or "Utopic Draco Future" until one of the player's monsters [[leaves the field]], which can allow the opponent to use a monster on their field as a [[Material]] even after its effect has been negated. It also requires an additional spot in the Extra Deck for "[[Number 39: Utopia Double]]".
  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Gogogo Goblindbergh]]"
  | end     = "[[Number F0: Utopic Future Zexal]]" + "[[Number F0: Utopic Draco Future]]" + "[[Number 99: Utopia Dragonar]]" + "[[Number S39: Utopia Prime]]" + "[[Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord]]" + "[[Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy]]" + "[[Unbreakable Xyz Barrier]]" + "[[Numbers Protection]]" + "[[Gogogo]]" monster in hand

  It is also possible to end with an "Ultimate Leo Utopia Ray" equipped with "ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber" instead of "Number 90: Galaxy-Eyes Photon Lord". This creates a stronger end board since "Ultimate Leo Utopia Ray" and "ZW - Pegasus Twin Saber" have reusable negation effects, "but the "ZW -" monsters can be dead draws and both effects cannot be activated if "Pegasus Twin Saber" leaves the field. "Number S39: Utopia Prime" can be incorporated into the end board following the steps above.
