  "'''Noble Arms'''", known as "'''Holy Sword'''" ({{Ruby|聖|せい}}{{Ruby|剣|けん}} ''Seiken'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Equip Spell Card]]s introduced in ''[[Return of the Duelist]]''.

  == Origin ==
  The original members are based around the tales of the [[wikipedia:Round Table|Knights of the Round Table]] and supports the "[[Noble Knight]]" archetype. The first [[support]] for the archetype was introduced in ''[[Abyss Rising]]'' with the release of "[[Ignoble Knight of Black Laundsallyn]]". "[[Gwenhwyfar, Queen of Noble Arms]]", the first "Noble Arms" [[Monster Card]], was introduced in ''[[Legacy of the Valiant]]''.

  "[[Celestial Sword - Eatos]]" is also a "Noble Arms" card because it has 「{{Ruby|聖|せい}}{{Ruby|剣|けん}}」 in its Japanese names, but it is unrelated to the other "Noble Arms" cards and the "Noble Knights"; in the ''TCG'', it has an [[archetype condition]] to clarify it is a "Noble Arms" card. Additionally, "[[Celtic Guard of Noble Arms]]" and "[[Dunnell, the Noble Arms of Light]]" are members of the archetype, but are also unrelated to the other "Noble Arms" cards.

  ''[[Rise of the Duelist]]'' introduced the ""Infernoble Arms"" (name is in quotations) which are based on weapons wielded by characters from the epic poem, [[wikipedia:The Song of Roland|The Song of Roland]]. To differentiate with the original "Noble Arms" cards, the group's Japanese name contains 『{{Ruby|焔|えん}}{{Ruby|聖|せい}}{{Ruby|剣|けん}}』 (""Flame Holy Sword"") instead of just {{Ruby|聖|せい}}{{Ruby|剣|けん}} ("Holy Sword").

  == Effects ==
  All the Arthurian "Noble Arms" Equip Spell Cards (with the exception of "[[Noble Arms - Excaliburn]]") share the following common effects:
  * Each of them is [[Control only one|side-unique]].
  * They can only be equipped to [[Warrior]] monsters.
  * If destroyed while face-up on the field and sent to the [[Graveyard]], the player can [[target]] 1 face-up Warrior "Noble Knight" monster they control and equip the destroyed card to that target.
  The ""Infernoble Arms"" all share the following traits:
  * An [[Ignition Effect]] that can be activated while equipped to a monster.
  * A [[Trigger Effect]] that activates if they are sent to the [[GY]] because the equipped monster was sent to the GY.

  == Artwork ==
  All of the Arthurian "Noble Arms" Equip Spell Cards (except "Excaliburn" and "[[Noble Arms - Clarent]]") have artworks that depict a sword embedded in stone, a reference to the Arthurian legend of [[wikipedia:Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|the Sword in the Stone]].
  All of the ""Infernoble Arms"" Equip Spell Cards have artworks that depict them within display cases in a museum with silhouetted onlookers in the background.
