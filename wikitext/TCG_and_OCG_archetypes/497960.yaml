  "'''Rokket'''", known in the ''[[OCG]]'' as either "'''Vullet'''" or "'''Varrett'''"<ref>{{episode|VRAINS|010|ref}} (official subs)</ref> (ヴァレット ''Varetto''), is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Roken Kogami|Roken Kogami/Varis]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]'' anime. They are associated with the "[[Borrel]]" archetype.
  ==Design==
  With the exception of "[[Rokket Coder]]", which is [[Cyberse]] and has a humanoid appearance, all "Rokket" monsters are legless, mechanical [[Dragon]] monsters with heads shaped like various types of ammunition and have green hard-light wings (except "[[Silverrokket Dragon]]" and "[[Rokket Caliber]]", whose wings are magenta).
  ==Etymology==
  "Rokket" is a play on the word "rocket". The Japanese name, "Vullet", is a corruption of "bullet", playing on the tendency of Japanese to replace "V" sounds with "B" ones. It may also reference the archetype's user in the anime, Varis, who shares a similar gun and ammunition theme in his Japanese name of "Revolver" and the designs of his masks. The "[[Borrel]]" archetype uses the same play with the word "barrel". The Italian name, "Mizzile", is a cross between "Missile" and "Razzo" (rocket).
  Some of other monsters used by [[Varis]] also have names and artworks based on guns and military terms, like "[[Chobham Armor Dragon]]" and "[[Vorticular Drumgon]]", similar to members of this archetype.

  ==Playing style==
  All "Rokket Dragon" monsters share the following two [[only once per turn]] effects:
  * ''When a [[Link Monster]]'s [[effect]] is [[activate]]d that [[target]]s this [[face-up]] card on the [[field]] ([[Quick Effect]]): You can [[destroy]] this card, then [...]''
  * ''During the [[End Phase]], if this card is in the [[Graveyard|GY]] because it was destroyed on the field by [[battle]] or card effect and [[Send|sent]] there this [[turn]]: You can [[Special Summon]] 1 "Rokket" [[Monster Card|monster]] from your [[Main Deck|Deck]], except [a card with the same name].''
  The most basic gameplan of the [[Deck]] is to use the [[Link Rating|Link]]-4 "[[Borrel]]" monsters (and other Link Monsters as well) to target "Rokket" monsters the player controls, which in turn would activate their effects. The effects of the "Borrel" monsters cannot be chained to, allowing the player to reliably trigger the effects of their "Rokket" monsters without mid-[[Chain]] interruptions from the opponent.
  * "[[Anesthrokket Dragon]]" renders a face-up monster unable to [[attack]] and negates their effects.
  * "[[Autorokket Dragon]]" sends a [[Spell]]/[[Trap]] on the field to the Graveyard.
  * "[[Exploderokket Dragon]]" inflicts 2000 [[damage]] to both players.
  * "[[Magnarokket Dragon]]" sends a monster to the Graveyard.
  * "[[Metalrokket Dragon]]" destroys the opponent's cards in the same [[column]].
  * "[[Shelrokket Dragon]]" destroys a monster in the same column, along with all monsters in its adjacent zones.
  * "[[Silverrokket Dragon]]" looks at the opponent's [[Extra Deck]] and banish 1 monster from it.
  Supports from ''[[Structure Deck: Rokket Revolt]]'' solidifies the Deck's [[swarm]]ing capabilities and their gameplan, which is necessary to Summon their "Borrel" monsters. In particular, "[[Rokket Tracer]]" is now the focal point of the Deck, with its effect to Summon more "Rokket" monsters simply by destroying a face-up card the player controls. "[[Absorouter Dragon]]" can also Special Summon itself if there's a "Rokket" monster on the player's field, while also searching another "Rokket" when it's sent to the GY by any means. "[[Quadborrel Dragon]]" can also destroys a Link Monster on the field (including itself) to revive more "Rokket" monsters from the GY; it is especially powerful when used alongside "[[Dillingerous Dragon]]" (which can revive itself when a "Rokket" is Special Summoned to the player's field). "[[Striker Dragon]]" searches the all-important "[[Boot Sector Launch]]", while it can also recover "Rokket" monster from the GY to be Summoned via "Boot Sector Launch".
  ===Rokket Dragon Link===
  Though the archetype is designed with the "fire and reload" mechanic (self-destruction effect) in mind, the archetype's ability to swarm [[DARK]] Dragon monsters means that the Deck is more optimally, and more popularly, played as a [[Dragon Link]] Deck, and is in general one of the most popular and efficient engines within Dragon Link Deck builds. In Dragon Link Decks, the "fire and reload" mechanic is entirely ignored in favor of swarming as many Dragon monsters as possible to perform consistent combos and fill the board with generic boss monsters and disruptions, using generic Dragon support such as the "[[Guardragon]]" Link Monsters to swarm the field even further.

  With the release of "[[Bystial]]" [[archetype]] and new "[[Chaos]]" support, both of which features focus on [[DARK]] monsters and [[Banish|banish-oriented]] gameplay.  Dragon Link Decks can effectively uses both themes to further support the playstyle. With the "Bystials" providing extra consistency boost by searching and/or summoning various easy-to-summon Dragon monsters as well as providing various form of interruption, whereas "Chaos" support aims to exploit both the banishment effect of the "Bystial" and the large number of DARK monsters to further boost the consistency.

  ===Weakness===
  * "[[Striker Dragon]]" is a crucial card in starting the Dragon Link/"Rokket" combo. As such, negating its searching effect for "[[Boot Sector Launch]]" can slow down the deck's gameplans.
  * The deck generally relies on negation effects on their boss monsters, because of this, cards such as "[[Dark Ruler No More]]" or "[[Forbidden Droplet]]" can neutralize the threats of a "Rokket"/Dragon Link endboard.
  ** Also, since all of these boss monsters have 3000 ATK or more, "[[Super Starslayer TY-PHON - Sky Crisis]]" is capable of effectively neutralize their negation, allowing the opponent to picking off each bosses with less resistance.
