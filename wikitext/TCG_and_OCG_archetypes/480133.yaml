  "'''Starving Venom'''", known as "'''Starve Venom'''" (スターヴ・ヴェノム ''Sutāvu Venomu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] [[Fusion Monster]]s used by [[Yuya Sakaki]], [[Yuri]], and [[Z-ARC]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Venom]]" archetype, and is related to the "[[Fusion Dragon]]" archetype.
  == Playing style ==
  As with the "Fusion Dragon" archetype, the "Starving Venom" archetype is focused on "all-out stealing", ranging from changing [[ATK]], gaining or negating [[effect]]s, and having effects. The archetype is only supported by "[[Odd-Eyes Venom Dragon]]" whose effects share similar characteristics with the members.
  == Members ==
  "Odd-Eyes Venom Dragon" is not a member of the archetype, but rather the only card that supports it.
