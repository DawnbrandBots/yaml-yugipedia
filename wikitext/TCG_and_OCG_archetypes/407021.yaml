  "'''Dinomist'''" (ダイナミスト ''Dainamisuto'') is an [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Machine]] [[Pendulum Monster]]s that debuted in ''[[Breakers of Shadow]]''. All of its members have a [[Level]] of either 4 or 5, as well as a [[Pendulum Scale]] of either 3 or 6. Like the "[[Igknight]]" and "[[Majespecter]]" archetypes, they have a connection to the "[[Dracoslayer]]" archetype.
  They were used by [[Shingo Sawatari (DY)|Shingo Sawatari]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V The Strongest Duelist Yuya!!]]'' manga.

  == Etymology ==
  Their English name seems to be a portmanteau of "dinosaur" and "mist", referring to their dinosaur-like appearance and WATER [[Attribute]]. The Japanese names indicates a word play with "[[wikipedia:Dynamo|Dynamo]]" instead, referring to them being Machines. Both appear to be correct, as the archetype seems to make references to both "dinosaurs" and "dynamo". It can also be a pun on "dynamis" ("δύναμις", also transliterated as "dunamis"), the Greek word for "power" or "strength".

  == Lore ==
  '''''From Master Duel's Solo Mode'''''
  ; The Steam Dinosaurs from Uncharted Lands
  ''A great river rushing with pristine water, a forest inhabited with a bounty of creatures, a volcano brimming with boiling lava... Those are unexplored lands full of the wonders of nature. Therein creatures with their own unique ecology live; mechanical dinosaurs. Known as "Dinomists," their novelty lies in the steam engines that power their hulking forms. The key to their survival in that great wilderness is that their bodies are suited to the harsh environment. This time, let's take a closer look at the shrouded ecology of the "Dinomists."
  ''Drifting with the gentle flow of the river is the long-necked "[[Dinomist Plesios]]." It derives its energy from water absorbed through a pipe in its tail. Not only is stabilizing energy produced by its hover unit supporting the beast's own weight, the balance bettween the water imbibed and the steam released prevents flooding the river. As a result, land-dwelling companions are protected from potential flood damage.''
  ''Flying freely through the great skies is the winged "[[Dinomist Pteran]]." Turbines on both wings collect moisture in the air and generate energy for high-speed flight. The water vapor released is cooled by the atmosphere, turning into rainclouds and hydrating the earth. Among the known "Dinomists," those in the waters and skies are a rarity. Next, let's take a look at the many "Dinomists" that dwell on land.''
  ''This time we direct our gaze to the land. Here a great many "Dinomists" can be observed.''
  ''Raising a great dust as they [[Dinomist Rush|trample the earth]] are "[[Dinomist Ceratops]]" and "[[Dinomist Stegosaur]]." Hardly a competition, theirs is closer to patrol that protects the territory. "Ceratops" use sharp protrusions on their bodies to crush the boulders spewed by volcanic eruptions, making the land more suitable for their companions. "Stegosaurs'" backs are lined with fins in the shape of swords that monitor the surrounding climate. Fluctuations in temperature and wind velocity. that pose potential danger to the land are sensed by those fins.''
  ''In the unknown lands where the "Dinomists" live there is one particularly perilous place. Namely, the volcano belt. Herein colossal creatures glare at each other, [[Dinomists Howling|vying to be the boss of all "Dinomists."]] Those are the "[[Dinomist Spinos]]" and "[[Dinomist Rex]]." Both convert their steam engines' energy into electricity, and their power surpasses that of other "Dinomists." The two are rivals, but when a foreign enemy invades, they band together to protect their territory. That is their role as bosses.''
  ''And so the "Dinomists" perform their symbiotic roles as they coexist in those unexplored lands.''

  == Playing style ==
  "Dinomist" cards cater to aggressive players, focusing on amassing multiple monsters through Pendulum Summon while preventing their opponent from countering them via support from the Pendulum Zones. All Scale 3 "Dinomists" have the Pendulum Effect "''If another "Dinomist" card(s) you control would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can destroy this card instead.''", while all Scale 6 "Dinomists" have the Pendulum Effect "''Before resolving a card effect that targets another "Dinomist" card(s) you control, you can negate the effect, then destroy this card. This effect can only be used once while this card is in the Pendulum Zone.''" Combined, two differently-Scaled "Dinomists" in your Pendulum Zones can neutralize almost any threat to the "Dinomists" in your Monster Zones at the cost of destroying themselves, allowing the monsters themselves to battle uninhibited. Their Spell & Trap Cards enable greater utility and power by searching, directly Special Summoning from the Deck, and locking down your opponent's ability to respond to battle through card effects.

  === Post Link Summoning ===
  The New Master Rule updates affected Dinomist's playing style so that you ought to perform a [[Link Summon]] like "[[Heavymetalfoes Electrumite]]" or "[[Qliphort Genius]]", in order to get Dinomist monsters back from the Extra deck with your Pendulum Summon, "[[Pendulum Paradox]]", or "[[Dinomist Charge]]". The built-in summoning conditions of [[Dinomist Brachion]] and [[Dinomist Ceratops]] can assist special summoning these cards without losing your Normal Summon, while "[[Dinomist Charge]]" will return one of them to your hand to be freely Pendulum Summoned to any Main Monster Zone.
  The following cards may also assist the deck:
  * "[[Abyss Actor - Curtain Raiser]]" is a free Scale 7 Pendulum Monster that can Special Summon itself from the Pendulum Zone and also be used as material for any generic rank 4 Xyz Monster, or as Link Material for any generic Link Monster or "Heavymetalfoes Electrumite".
  * "[[Speedroid Passinglider]]" can work as a Level 5 Pendulum Monster version of "[[Photon Thrasher]]" if you choose to go first.
  * Already mentioned,"[[Heavymetalfoes Electrumite]]" can destroy scales in order to recover a "[[Symphonic Warrior Guitaar]]" from your Extra Deck that was placed there by the first effect of "Heavymetalfoes Electrumite", then use the effect of "[[Symphonic Warrior Guitaar]]"' to Special Summon "[[Symphonic Warrior Miccs]]" from the Main Deck and gain an additional Normal Summon, and since "Miccs" a Level 5 Machine monster, it can be used for the Xyz Summon of "[[Cyber Dragon Nova]]" and through it, "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]".
