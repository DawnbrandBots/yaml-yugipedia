  == Playing style ==
  A standard "Hazy Flame" [[Deck]] mainly focuses on setting up [[Xyz Summon]]s and has a relatively broad variety of effects that range from [[search]]ing ("[[Hazy Flame Cerbereus]]") to [[swarm]]ing ("[[Hazy Flame Peryton]]"); the main goal is to set up the Xyz Summon of their [[ace monster]], "[[Hazy Flame Basiltrice]]". It gains additional effects depending on the number of [[Xyz Material]]s attached to it, and can be Xyz Summoned with the aid of cards like "[[Hazy Flame Hydra]]" and "[[Hazy Pillar]]", and if successfully Summoned using 5 [[Level]] 6 [[FIRE]] monsters, it reaches a hefty 3500 [[ATK]] and cannot be [[target]]ed by the opponent's effects or be [[destroy]]ed by any effect. This makes it difficult to overcome in battle, and the only [[card effect]]s that can eliminate it are situational or [[archetype]]-restricted ones that do not target or destroy it: examples include "[[Black Sonic]]", "[[Neo-Spacian Grand Mole]]", "[[Stellarknight Triverr]]", "[[Lava Golem]]", "[[Super Polymerization]]", "[[Gishki Zielgigas]]", "[[Orea, the Sylvan High Arbiter]]" etc. However, it can still be [[destroyed by battle]].
  The advent of [[Pendulum Summon]]ing may help them to [[swarm]] the [[field]] quickly (except for "[[Hazy Flame Peryton]]", which has a [[Special Summon]] restriction), allowing the player to [[Summon]] up to 5 "Hazy Flame" monsters at once and have quick access to [[Xyz Summon]]s.
  Some other cards that can help a "Hazy Flame" [[Deck]] include:
  * "[[Fire King]]": monsters like "[[Fire King Avatar Yaksha]]" and "[[Fire King High Avatar Garunix]]" can help set off the effect of "Cerberus" to [[search]] for a "[[Hazy Pillar]]" or another "Hazy Flame" monster while also [[destroy]]ing the opponent's monsters at the same time giving the player a [[field]] advantage over their opponent.
  * "[[Rekindling]]": allows the player to [[Special Summon]] "[[Hazy Flame Cerbereus]]", "[[Hazy Flame Hyppogrif|Hyppogrif]]", and "[[Hazy Flame Hydra|Hydra]]" [[swarm]]ing the [[field]] with high-[[ATK]] monsters or [[Xyz Summon]]ing "Basiltrice" with 4 [[Xyz Material]]s [[attach]]ed to it.
  * "[[Hieratic Dragon of Tefnuit]]": can [[Special Summon]] itself and then [[Tribute]] itself in order to [[Normal Summon]] a "Hazy Flame" monster; uses its effect to Special Summon "[[Tyhone #2]]". With this, it is already possible to Xyz Summon "Basiltrice", but if the player [[Tribute Summon]] "[[Hazy Flame Peryton]]", they can use its effect to Special Summon 2 "[[Hazy Flame Hydra]]s" from the [[Deck]] and [[attach]] 2 more "Hazy Flame" [[destroy]]ed monsters as [[Xyz Material]]s to it.
  * "[[Card Advance]]": use it in order to be aware of the top cards of the [[Deck]] and use the effect of "[[Hazy Flame Sphynx]]" at its best; it also gives an additional [[Tribute Summon]].
  * "[[Flamvell Firedog]]": it can be used to [[Special Summon]] "[[Hazy Flame Cerbereus]]" from the [[Deck]], which will keep its solid 2000 [[ATK]] intact.
  * "[[Onslaught of the Fire Kings]]": can also be used to [[Special Summon]] "Cerbereus" while allowing to use its [[search]]ing effect during the [[End Phase]].
  * "[[Fairy Knight Ingunar]]": can bounce every other card on the [[field]] to the [[hand]] and can refuel its effect by using "[[Hazy Pillar]]".
  * "[[Stoic Challenge]]": if the player [[equip]]s a 5-[[Xyz Material]]s "Basiltrice" with this card, it will gain a massive 3000 [[ATK]] boost, double the [[battle damage]] dealt to an opponent's monster and will not be [[destroy]]ed during the opponent's [[End Phase]].

  === Weaknesses ===
  Due to the variety of abilities, immunity against targeting effects and the fact that the main objective is to [[Xyz Summon]] [[Rank]] 6 monsters, virtually there is not a wide range of options of cards that can totally shut a "Hazy Flame" [[Deck]] down. However, cards that forbid or restrict [[Special Summon]]s, such as "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]", "[[El Shaddoll Winda]]" etc., can prevent them from [[swarm]]ing the [[field]]. Effects that restrict based on [[Level]] or [[Attribute]], such as "[[Tualatin]]" and "[[Stygian Dirge]]", can also mean trouble to a dedicated "Hazy Flame" Deck. If a player Xyz Summons "Basiltrice" with 3 or less [[Xyz Material]]s, it is also vulnerable to "[[Xyz Encore]]", "[[Compulsory Evacuation Device]]", etc.; as their strategy of swarming the field in order to [[Summon]] their [[ace monster]] is resource-intensive (i.e. "Peryton" must [[send]] itself and another [[FIRE]] monster to the [[Graveyard]] to [[Special Summon]] 2 monsters; "Sphynx" mills the top card of the Deck), losing "Basilitrice" to a card effect or having its Summon [[negate]]d is a heavy punishment in terms of [[card advantage]]. negating the Xyz Summon also works. Finally, getting "[[Hazy Pillar]]" or "[[Hazy Glory]]" destroyed prematurely (especially by the splashable "[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]") can severely slow the player down.
