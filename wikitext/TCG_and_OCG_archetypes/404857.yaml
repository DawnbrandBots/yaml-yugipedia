  "'''Kozmo'''" ({{Ruby|Ｋｏｚｍｏ|コズモ}} ''Kozumo'') is an archetype consisting of [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] [[Psychic]] "pilot" monsters and [[Machine]] "spaceship" [[Monster Card|monsters]]. The archetype debuted as one of two [[TCG Exclusive|''TCG''-exclusive]] archetypes that premiered in ''[[Clash of Rebellions]]'', the other being the "[[Kaiju]]" archetype.

  The archetype and its cards were first revealed in a series of blog posts posted on the official Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game Strategy Site in 2015, written by by Konami R&D Specialist Jerome McHale. Background lore information surrounding some individual cards in the "Kozmo" archetype were provided in these blog posts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=7285 |title=A New Journey Begins… |last=McHale |first=Jerome |date=July 13, 2015 |publisher=Konami |accessdate= August 25, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=7290 |title=On the Run |last=McHale |first=Jerome |date=July 14, 2015 |publisher=Konami |accessdate= August 25, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=7294 |title=You’ve Never Heard of the Forerunner? |last=McHale |first=Jerome |date=July 15, 2015 |publisher=Konami |accessdate= August 25, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=7305 |title=Destiny Among the Stars |last=McHale |first=Jerome |date=July 16, 2015 |publisher=Konami |accessdate= August 25, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=7474 |title=Special Report: Witch-Related Incidents on the Rise, Again |last=McHale |first=Jerome |date=October 9, 2015 |publisher=Konami |accessdate= August 25, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=7478 |title=The #1 Name in Home Security |last=McHale |first=Jerome |date=October 13, 2015 |publisher=Konami |accessdate= August 25, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=7482 |title=Discretion is the Better Part of Valor |last=McHale |first=Jerome |date=October 14, 2015 |publisher=Konami |accessdate= August 25, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=7485 |title=Close Quarters Combat |last=McHale |first=Jerome |date=October 15, 2015|publisher=Konami |accessdate= August 25, 2021}}</ref>

  == Design ==
  The "Kozmo" cards seem to be based on properties from ''[[wikipedia:The Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Star Wars|Star Wars]]''. The pilot monsters are based on characters, the spaceship monsters on objects and vehicles, and the [[Field Spell Card]] on a location. The pilot monsters being Psychics is likely a reference to the [[wikipedia:The Force (Star Wars)|Force]]-sensitive characters from ''Star Wars''.

  == Playing style ==
  The pilot monsters have a [[Quick Effect]] to banish themselves from the field to Special Summon any "Kozmo" monster from the [[hand]] with a higher Level, while the spaceship monsters have a [[Trigger Effect]] to banish themselves from the [[Graveyard]] when [[destroy]]ed to Special Summon or add to the hand (depending on the card) any "Kozmo" monster from the [[Main Deck|Deck]] with a lower Level.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=7313 |title=Frontier in Space |last=McHale |first=Jerome |date=July 20, 2015 |publisher=Konami |accessdate=April 22, 2016 |quote=The Kozmo monsters are split up into two groups: the Psychic “pilot” monsters and the Machine “spaceship” monsters. Pilots can be banished to Summon any Kozmo monster from your hand with a higher Level than the pilot as a Quick Effect, and spaceships can be banished when they’re destroyed to Summon any Kozmo monster from your Deck with a lower Level.}}</ref> In addition, many of ships have targeting protection.

  The "Kozmo" strategy generally focuses on dealing large amounts of damage as fast as possible through winning battles rather than more complicated card combos. The "Kozmo" monsters themselves have few removal effects, so instead must focus on their attacks. Fortunately, their Summoning Quick Effects can make up for this lack of removal, and they can work well with battle tricks like "[[Honest]]" and "[[Juragedo]]" to ensure damage.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The ships are protected from targeting and float if destroyed, which made them hard to deal with for the time. Therefore, cards that offer non-targeting non-destruction removal, such as "[[Kaiju]]"-like monsters, [[Triple Tactics Talent]]", and "[[Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon]]", are effective against the Deck.
  * Floodgates:
  ** Anti-banish floodgates, like "[[Artifact Lancea]]" or "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]", will prevent the archetype from Special Summoning, as all "Kozmo" monsters need to banish themselves for their Summon effects.
  ** Anti-LIGHT/DARK floodgates, like "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]" or "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]", can effectively shut down their corresponding portion of the Deck.
  ** "[[Deck Lockdown]]" can serve to prevent "[[Kozmo Farmgirl]]" and "[[Kozmo Tincan]]" from using their search effects, as well as prevent the "Kozmo" [[Machine]] monsters from using their Graveyard effects to replace themselves.
  ** "[[Grave of the Super Ancient Organism]]" can drastically slow this Deck.
  ** Note that "[[Kozmo Sliprider]]" can be used to remove Continuous Spell/Trap floodgates. 
  * Monster cards that can prevent "Kozmo" monsters from activating their effects during the Battle Phase or Damage Step (such as "[[Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon]]" and "[[Number S39: Utopia the Lightning]]," respectively) can cripple this deck's ability to keep monsters on the field.
  * Due to the amount of high Level ships required for the Deck to function, it can be prone to bricking.
