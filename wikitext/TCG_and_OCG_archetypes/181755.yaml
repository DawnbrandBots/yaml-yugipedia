  "'''Gimmick Puppet'''" (ギミック・パペット ''Gimmikku Papetto'') is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[DARK]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] (with the exception of the [[EARTH]] [[Attribute]] "[[Gimmick Puppet Egg Head]]" and "[[Gimmick Puppet Gear Changer]]" and the [[LIGHT]] Attribute "[[Gimmick Puppet Princess]]") used by [[Quattro]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime. They are also a sub-archetype of the "[[Puppet]]" archetype.

  Initially, the members only used by Quattro that were released in the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'' were "[[Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll]]", "[[Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll]]", "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder]]", "[[Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings]]", and "[[Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo]]"; however, the ''TCG'' release of ''[[Number Hunters]]'', and future support thereafter, made a pure "Gimmick Puppet" Deck possible.

  == Design ==
  [[File:GimmickPuppet.png|200px|left|thumb|[[Quattro]] (back), with "[[Gimmick Puppet Egg Head (anime)|Egg Head]]" and "[[Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll (anime)|Dreary Doll]]" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|anime]].]]

  The "Gimmick Puppet" monsters are based on [[wikipedia:Puppet|puppets]], objects resembling humanoid figures or mythological creatures that are animated and manipulated by the [[wikipedia:Puppeteer|puppeteer]]. This is reflected in this archetype's user, Quattro, who manipulates his victims and opponents so he could cruelly and mercilessly destroy them in his Duels.

  In terms of appearance, certain members of the archetype are based on dolls wearing [[wikipedia:Victorian fashion|Victorian era clothing]], while other members are toys with humanoid doll parts; however, most of the members feature unsettling designs, ranging from creatures made entirely of humanoid doll parts to decrepit humanoid dolls. In the ''TCG'' and the English dubbed version of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL'' anime, most of the "Gimmick Puppet" monsters' appearances are edited, likely due to their horrific designs.

  == Playing style ==
  This archetype and its supporting "[[Puppet]]" [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s center around Summoning their [[Rank 8 Monster Cards|Rank 8]] monsters, then using "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" Spells to summon their "[[Number C]]"/"[[CXyz]]" Rank 9 monsters. Their effects often include changing levels, dealing burn damage, and Summoning monsters to the opponent's field.

  Prior to the release of ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]'', "Gimmick Puppet" cards were relatively weak. Their intended ace monsters, "[[Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo]]" and "[[Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo]]" were slow and 'gimmicky' [[duel winner]]s, and the deck lacked efficient ways to Summon Rank 8 materials or to access "Rank-Up-Magic" Spells.  

  With the release of ''The Infinite Forbidden'', the archetype gained considerable boosts to consistency and power, enabling "[[FTK]]" strategies. It can do so either by dealing 8000+ effect damage with cards like "[[Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings|Number C40]]" and "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder|Number 15]]", or by fulfilling the duel winner effect of "[[Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo|Number C88]]". They could be protected from [[hand trap]]s with various cards like "[[Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls]]", and even if prevented from an FTK, Decks could often make an endboard with a few interactions. However, the limits imposed in the [[July 2024 Lists (OCG)]] and [[September 2024 Lists (TCG)]] made the FTK less consistent (though still possible).

  Notable Main Deck cards:
  * "[[Gimmick Puppet Little Soldiers|Little Soldiers]]", "[[Gimmick Puppet Scissor Arms]]", and "[[Condolence Puppet]]" can each send "Gimmick Puppets" to the GY. The former 2 are on Summon: "Little Soldiers" sends for [[cost]] (meaning it cannot be interrupted) and can change its Level by the sent monster's; "Scissor Arms" sends for effect, and only sends on Normal Summon. "Condolence Puppet" is a Spell that sends card equal to the number of Extra Deck monsters your opponent controls + 1, and can protect a Machine Xyz Monster from destruction.
  * "[[Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll|Bisque Doll]]" and "[[Gimmick Puppet Terror Baby|Terror Baby]]" can banish themselves from the GY to protect "Gimmick Puppet" monsters; "Bisque Doll" protects them from targeting effects, while "Terror Baby" prevents the opponent from responding to "Gimmick Puppet" monster effects.
  * "[[Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls]]" is a field spell that searches a Gimmick Puppet card on activation, and gives "Gimmick Puppet" monsters immunity to your opponent's non-Xyz activated monster effects. It can also summon a "Gimmick Puppet" monster to your opponent's field.
  * "[[Gimmick Puppet Rouge Doll|Rouge Doll]]" is one of the Deck's main playmakers, able to summon itself and another "Gimmick Puppet" by revealing an in-archetype card within the Extra Deck, and adding itself to hand if sent to the GY.
  * "[[Gimmick Puppet Cattle Scream|Cattle Scream]]" and "[[Gimmick Puppet Fiendish Knight|Fiendish Knight]]" are Level 8 extenders. "Cattle Scream" can be Special Summoned by detaching an Xyz material, and if attached to a "Gimmick Puppet" Xyz monster, allows the attached monster to summon a "Gimmick Puppet" from your GY to your opponent's field. "Fiendish Knight" can Special Summon itself from hand, then Summon a "Gimmick Puppet" from your GY to your field, or any monster from the opponent's GY to their field.
  * "[[Gimmick Puppet Nightmare]]" can Special Summon itself, and one other copy from hand/GY, by tributing a Machine Xyz monster. When Special Summoned, it prevents the controller from Special Summoning non-"Gimmick Puppet" monsters for the rest of the turn. Intended as an extender for the archetype, other Decks could summon it to the opponent's field with "[[Albion the Sanctifire Dragon]]".
  * "[[Service Puppet Play]]" is a Trap that takes control of opposing monsters, equal to the number of "Gimmick Puppet" Xyz monsters you control. Can banish itself to summon an Xyz monster from your GY to either field. Often used as an endboard piece if the FTK fails.

  Other extenders/advantage givers include "[[Junk Puppet]]", "[[Puppet Ritual]]", "[[Perform Puppet]]", and "[[Puppet Parade]]", though they are too slow or low impact for an FTK strategy.

  Notable Extra Deck monsters:
  * "[[Gimmick Puppet Fantasix Machinix]]" can search a "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" spell then grant an additional Normal Summon of a [[Machine]] monster. In the GY, it can summon itself to either field and recycle a "Rank-Up-Magic" Spell.
  * "[[CXyz Gimmick Puppet Fanatix Machinix]]" can search a "Puppet" Trap. It has another effect to Special Summon a monster to your opponent's side of the field. When a monster is Special Summoned to your opponent's side of the field, can destroy one monster and deal damage equal to half its original ATK. Often used as an endboard piece if the FTK fails.
  * "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder]]" and "[[Number C15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter]]" can each destroy an opponent's card (monster for "Number 15", any card for "Number C15"), then deal burn damage based on its ATK. Neither is subject to a hard [[once per turn]].
  * "[[Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings]]" places a [[String Counter]] on each monster on field, then be ranked up into "[[Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings]]", which destroys all monsters with a String Counter, then deals damage equal to the highest original ATK of monsters sent to the GY.
  * "[[Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo]]" is mainly used to rank up into "[[Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo]]", which can win the Duel if, during the End Phase, the opponent has <= 2000 LP and it has no materials.
  * "[[Gimmick Puppet Gigantes Doll]]" is the only Rank 4 "Gimmick Puppet": it can take control of up to 2 monsters your opponent controls for the rest of the turn, and can tribute itself to change all monsters you control to Level 8.
  * "[[Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll|Chimera Doll]]" is the archetype's Link monster, which can search or dump a "Gimmick Puppet" monster and Special Summon a "Gimmick Puppet" monster from hand.

  The most common "Rank-Up-Magic" spell to use is "[[Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force]]" for its once per Duel recycle effect, though other options are available.

  === Other additions ===
  Since "Gimmick Puppet" monster effects usually prevent the player from Special Summoning non-"Gimmick Puppet" monsters from the Extra Deck, the archetypal Deck only benefits from Main Deck engines.

  The most prominent is the "[[Horus]]" engine, which can help Summon Level 8 monsters needed for "Gimmick Puppet" Rank 8 Xyz Summons. "[[King's Sarcophagus]]" or "[[Imsety, Glory of Horus]]" can send "Gimmick Puppet" cards from hand to GY to activate their effects, and the former protects the "Horus" monsters from being destroyed by the effect of your own "Number C40". "[[Walls of the Imperial Tomb]]" can help get to "Imsety" more easily or it can be a secondary [[Field Spell]] to activate "[[Set Rotation]]" with.

  "[[Therion "King" Regulus]]" can equip any Machine monster to itself, acts as a powerful omni-negate, and serves as a Level 8 monster. "Regulus" does not have any protection from your "Number C40" effect, and cannot be searched in-archetype. However, "[[Therion Discolosseum]]" can search "Regulus" while acting as a secondary "Field Spell" to activate "Set Rotation" with.

  As a Machine Xyz-oriented Deck that can utilize "Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force", the archetype's playstyle is also supported with "[[Marshalling Field]]", though this card is too slow for their FTK-oriented playstyle.

  === Sample combos ===
  A "Gimmick Puppet" Deck is easily capable of performing an [[FTK]] with 1 or 2-card combos by using their arsenal of burn effects. Since the [[Limited]] status of "[[Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings]]" and "[[Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings]]" (''TCG'' only) imposed by the [[July 2024 Lists (OCG)]] and [[September 2024 Lists (TCG)]], the Deck lost several of its potential FTK combo branches although a handful of them are still possible. 

  ==== 1-card FTK ====
  The most notable method, which also happens to be the safest, only requires "[[Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls]]", which provides consistency, protection from monster effects, as well as one additional monster to be destroyed and damage the opponent.

  # Activate the effect of "Rouge Doll" in the GY to return itself to the hand.
  # Activate the effect of "Rouge Doll" by revealing any Rank 8 "Gimmick Puppet" monster to [[Special Summon]] itself from the hand and "[[Gimmick Puppet Cattle Scream]]" from the Deck.
  # Use "Cattle Scream" and one other Level 8 "Gimmick Puppet" monster as [[Xyz Material]]s to [[Xyz Summon]] "[[Gimmick Puppet Fantasix Machinix]]".
  # Activate the first effect of "Fantasix Machinix" by detaching "Cattle Scream" to add "[[Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force]]" and allow an additional Normal Summon of a [[Machine]] monster.
  # Activate "Argent Chaos Force" by targeting "Fantasix Machinix" to Xyz Summon "[[CXyz Gimmick Puppet Fanatix Machinix]]".
  # (Optional): Activate the first effect of "Fanatix Machinix" by adding any "[[Puppet]]" [[Trap Card|Trap]].
  # Activate the effect of "Cattle Scream" by detaching "Fantasix Machinix" from "Fanatix Machinix" to Special Summon it from the GY.
  # Use "Cattle Scream" and the other Level 8 "Gimmick Puppet" monster as Xyz Materials to [[Xyz Summon]] "[[Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings]]".
  # Activate the effect of "Argent Chaos Force" to add itself back from the GY to the hand.
  # Activate the effect of "Number 40" by detaching "Cattle Scream" to place a [[String Counter]] on "Fanatix Machinix".
  # Activate the second effect of "Fanatix Machinix" by detaching "Little Soldiers" to Special Summon "Cattle Scream" to the opponent's field.
  # Activate "Argent Chaos Force" by targeting "Number 40" to Xyz Summon "[[Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings]]".
  # The effect of "Number C40" mandatorily activates as Chain Link 1, then activate the effect of "Fantasix Machinix" as Chain Link 2 to Special Summon itself to your field and add "Argent Chaos Force" from the GY to the hand. The effect of "Number C40" resolves by destroying "Fanatix Machinix" and inflicts 3100 damage to the opponent and drawing a card.
  # (Optional): Activate the second effect of "Number C40" by detaching any material ("Number 40" or "Little Soldiers"/"Rouge Doll") to place a String Counter on "Cattle Scream".
  # Activate the second effect of "Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls" by detaching the last material from "Number C40" (if the previous step was not performed, then detach "Number 40" in this step) to Special Summon "Number 40" to your opponent's field.
  # Use "Fantasix Machinix" and "Number C40" as [[Link Material]] to [[Link Summon]] "[[Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll]]".
  # Activate the effect of "Chimera Doll" to add "[[Gimmick Puppet Terror Baby]]" from the Deck to the hand. Do not apply the second part of "Chimera Doll"'s effect to Special Summon "Terror Baby".
  # Normal Summon "Terror Baby" (the additional Normal Summon from the first effect of "Fantasix Machinix") then activate its first effect to Special Summon "Rouge Doll" from the GY.
  # Activate the second effect of "Little Soldiers" by banishing it in the GY to target "Terror Baby" to increase its Level by 4 to make it a Level 8 monster.
  # Use "Terror Baby" and "Rouge Doll" as Xyz Material to Xyz Summon "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder]]".
  # Activate the effect of "Number 15" (by detaching any material) to target your "Number 40" on your opponent's field to destroy it and inflict 3000 damage.
  # Activate "Argent Chaos Force" by targeting "Number 15" to Xyz Summon "[[Number C15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter]]".
  # Activate the effect of "Number C15" (by detaching any material) to target your "Cattle Scream" on your opponent's field to destroy it and inflict 2000 damage.

  19*. The combo can be slightly amended from step 19 if the player already has: a Level 4/8 "Gimmick Puppet" monster in hand or a means to Summon another Level 8 monster, and has used the effect of "Number C40" to give "Cattle Scream" a String Counter. If the player has the former monster, the player should apply the second part of "Chimera Doll"'s effect to Special Summon that other "Gimmick Puppet" monster.

  20*. Normal Summon "Terror Baby" and use its effect targeting "Number C40" to Special Summon it.

  21*. The effect of "Number C40" mandatorily activates as Chain Link 1, which resolves by destroying "Cattle Scream" and inflicts 2000 damage to the opponent and drawing a card.

  22*. Activate the second effect of "Little Soldiers" by banishing it in the GY to target "Terror Baby" to increase its Level by 4 to make it a Level 8 monster (if the other monster is a Level 4 "Gimmick Puppet" monster, target that monster with the effect of "Little Soldiers" as well).

  23*. Use "Terror Baby" and the Level 8 monster as Xyz Material to Xyz Summon "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder]]".

  24*. Activate the effect of "Number 15" (by detaching any material) to target your "Number 40" on your opponent's field to destroy it and inflict 3000 damage.

  ==== 2-card FTK ====
  This strategy requires just "[[Gimmick Puppet Little Soldiers]]" and "[[Gimmick Puppet Rouge Doll]]" in hand. This was one of the FTK combos that is no longer elligible to be used following the Limited status of [[Limited]] status of "[[Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings]]" and "[[Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings]]" in the ''OCG'' and ''TCG'', although it is still possible in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!

  Since the [[Limited]] status of "[[Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings]]" and "[[Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings]]" (''TCG'' only), the following combo nearly accomplishes an FTK with the same "Little Soldiers" + "Rouge Doll" starting hand, ending on [[CXyz Gimmick Puppet Fanatix Machinix]], which can inflict the last instance of damage whenever the opponent Special Summons a monster.

  This combo allows the player to win as soon as the opponent's Draw Phase (ie. a pseudo-FTK), requiring "Little Soldiers", as well as Summoning another Level 8 monster and an effect which can send a card from the player's hand to the GY as cost or effect; "[[King's Sarcophagus]]" or "[[Imsety, Glory of Horus]]" can facilitate both of these.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * If "Gimmick Puppet" fails to perform an FTK, it will often be forced to pass on a relatively meager board, usually consisting solely of "[[CXyz Gimmick Puppet Fanatix Machinix]]", "[[Service Puppet Play]]", and whatever [[hand trap]]s or staples the player opened with.

  * As an archetypal Deck primarily centered around a FTK strategy, "Gimmick Puppet" excels at going first but will often struggle at going second, and will have difficulty playing through typical disruptions of modern boards or [[floodgate]]s that can easily counter the Deck.
  ** "Gimmick Puppet" being mainly comprised of [[DARK]] [[Machine]] monsters renders them vulnerable to common counters other DARK, [[Graveyard]]-dependent decks have (namely "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]", "[[Bystial]]" monsters, "[[Abyss Dweller]]", "[[Necrovalley]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]", "[[Dimension Shifter]]" etc.).
  ** Floodgates that can easily prevent the Deck's [[Xyz Summon]] include all typical [[Prevents your opponent's Special Summons|anti]]-[[Special Summon]]ing cards, including "[[Consecrated Light]]", "[[Dimensional Barrier]]". "Gimmick Puppet" Main Deck monsters also don't have high ATK.

  * Even with "[[Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls]]" present, there are a handful of key disruption points the opponent can use their hand traps on to potentially foil "Gimmick Puppet"'s FTK strategy if "[[Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll]]" and "[[Gimmick Puppet Terror Baby]]" are not present in the GY to activate their effects or even after their effects have resolved: 
  ** "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" can stop the deck's numerous searches; this is most potent immediately after the first elligible search (such as after adding a "Gimmick Puppet" monster upon activating "Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls"). "[[Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings]]" also cannot deal damage via its [[Trigger Effect]] effect while under Droll, because it requires a [[Draw a card|draw]] from the deck.
  ** "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" negating the effect of "[[Gimmick Puppet Rouge Doll]]" to Special Summon itself and a "Gimmick Puppet" monster from the Deck (which activates in the hand, thus it is not protected from "Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls") to slow them from getting into their first Xyz Summon.
  ** [[Trap Card]]s such as "[[Infinite Impermanence]]", "[[Dominus Purge]]" and "[[Dominus Impulse]]" can still disrupt "Gimmick Puppet" monster effects on the field which "Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls" does not protect from. "Dominus Impulse" can be used against a wide variety of Special Summon effects that "Gimmick Puppet" monsters or the activation of "[[Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force]]".
  ** Negating the search effect of "[[Gimmick Puppet Fantasix Machinix]]" (with "Infinite Impermanence" or "Dominus Purge") prevents the user from getting access to "Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force" or their additional Normal Summon (for the effects of "Terror Baby", "[[Gimmick Puppet Scissor Arms]]" etc.).
  ** The aformentioned Graveyard disruption tools (especially "Bystial" monsters and "[[D.D. Crow]]") prevent "Gimmick Puppet" monsters from being Summoned or from having any of their effects that can be activated from there. "D.D. Crow" can also be used to banish the "Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force" before it can be recurred by its own effect or the effect of "Gimmick Puppet Fantasix Machinix".
  ** "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]" can destroy "Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls" when it uses its effect to Special Summon a "Gimmick Puppet" monster to the oponent's field, while also removing its protection for "Gimmick Puppet" monsters.
  ** The opponent can use "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" can Tribute "Gimmick Puppet" monsters on their field (which "Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls" does not protect) before they can be destroyed by the "Gimmick Puppet"'s user's "Gimmick Puppet" Xyz Monsters. Additionally, the [[Monster Token]] created by "Nibiru, the Primal Being" stops "[[Gimmick Puppet Chimera Doll]]" from being able to summon a "Gimmick Puppet" from hand, which can be problematic towards many combo lines.
  ** "[[Ghost Sister & Spooky Dogwood]]" ensures the opponent will not lose on the first turn due to its LP gain effect for the Special Summon-oriented FTK strategy.
