  "'''Gimmick Puppet'''" (ギミック・パペット ''Gimmikku Papetto'') is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[DARK]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] (with the exception of "[[Gimmick Puppet Egg Head]]" and "[[Gimmick Puppet Gear Changer]]" being [[EARTH]] Machine monsters) used by [[Quattro]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime. They are also a sub-archetype of the "[[Puppet]]" archetype.

  Initially, the only used by Quattro that were released in the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'' were "[[Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll]]", "[[Gimmick Puppet Magnet Doll]]", "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder]]", "[[Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings]]", and "[[Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo]]"; however, the ''TCG'' release of ''[[Number Hunters]]'' brought with it several more of the archetype's Monster Cards, making a pure "Gimmick Puppet" Deck possible. As the ''Yu-Gi-Oh ZEXAL'' anime progressed, several more "Gimmick Puppet" cards were unveiled, including three "[[Number C]]" monsters. All of these new monsters and some previously not yet released in the ''TCG'' have been released in the ''[[Premium Gold]]'' set.

  == Design ==
  [[File:GimmickPuppet.png|200px|left|thumb|[[Quattro]] (back), with "[[Gimmick Puppet Egg Head (anime)|Egg Head]]" and "[[Gimmick Puppet Dreary Doll (anime)|Dreary Doll]]" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|anime]].]]

  The "Gimmick Puppet" monsters are based on [[wikipedia:Puppet|puppets]], objects resembling humanoid figures or mythological creatures that are animated and manipulated by the [[wikipedia:Puppeteer|puppeteer]]. This is reflected in this archetype's user, Quattro, who manipulates his victims and opponents so he could cruelly and mercilessly destroy them in his Duels.

  In terms of appearance, certain members of the archetype are based on dolls wearing [[wikipedia:Victorian fashion|Victorian era clothing]], while other members are toys with humanoid doll parts; however, most of the members feature unsettling designs, ranging from creatures made entirely of humanoid doll parts to decrepit humanoid dolls. In the ''TCG'' and the English dubbed version of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL'' anime, most of the "Gimmick Puppet" monsters' appearances are edited, likely due to their horrific designs.

  == Playing style ==
  This archetype and its associated cards are centered around quickly Summoning [[Level 8]] monsters to [[Xyz Summon]] their ace monsters; "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder]]", "[[Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings]]", and "[[Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo]]".

  [[Main Deck]] "Gimmick Puppet" monsters do not feature high enough [[ATK]] (the strongest non-[[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] being the [[Level]] 4 "[[Gimmick Puppet Fiendish Knight]]" at 1800), but they make up for it with different [[Monster effect|effects]] ranging from [[stall]]ing, [[swarm]]ing and even Summoning monsters to the opponent's side of the field for effect manipulation. Their main strategy is taking advantage of the opponent's monsters with high ATK to deal [[effect damage]] with their ace monsters; "[[Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings]]" and "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder]]". "[[Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo]]" offers an [[Victory Condition#Special Victory conditions|alternate victory strategy]] with its effect. Most "Gimmick Puppet" monsters tend to be high Leveled and can be Special Summoned with ease, although some of them have to be Special Summoned by different methods, such as "[[Gimmick Puppet Twilight Joker]]", which requires the player to banish a "Gimmick Puppet" that was [[destroyed by battle]].

  "Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder" has the effect to destroy up to two Special Summoned opponent monsters on the field, dealing damage equal to the [[original ATK]] of any Xyz Monster destroyed in this way. Its upgraded form, "[[Number C15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter]]", deals effect damage for any destroyed monster, but its effect can only be activated once per turn (for a total of three monster destruction effects).

  "Number 40: Gimmick Puppet of Strings" has a similar theme of effect damage, but the player needs "Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings" to complete its destruction effect in the same turn. "Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings'" effect activates when it is Special Summoned, and it can also be revived without the need for Xyz Material for a field nuke. With an Xyz Material, it can function as fuel for its Summon-Triggered effect, "[[Xyz Reborn]]" or something similar is recommended for this strategy.

  "[[Marshalling Field]]" and "[[Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force]]" both give many chances to Summon the "[[Number C]]" forms for stronger effect damage and "[[Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo]]". "Number 88: Gimmick Puppet of Leo" and "Disaster Leo's" effects are alternate [[Victory condition|win conditions]] that are far off the archetype's mild focus on effect damage and should be used just as a last strategy.

  The "[[Infinite Forbidden]]" set offers some new Gimmick Puppet support, centered around Special Summoning monsters on your opponent's field in order to gain full advantage of some of the Archetype's cards, which helps the player able to perform a [[First Turn Kill|FTK]] by using the effects of "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder]]", "[[Number C15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter ]]" and "[[Number C40: Gimmick Puppet of Dark Strings]]". The set also helps the player performing "[[Number C88: Gimmick Puppet Disaster Leo]]" alternative win condition much more easier. 

  "[[Mansion of the Dreadful Dolls]]" is a must-have for the Deck. It not only searches a "Gimmick Puppet" monster upon its activation, but your opponent also cannot destroy them by battle nor affect them with monster effects, except those of Xyz monsters, effectively rendering handtraps like "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]] and "[[Effect Veiler]]" completely ineffective while also offering an excellent protection against non-Xyz Decks. If the player wants, they can also play "[[Gimmick Puppet Bisque Doll]]" and "[[Gimmick Puppet Terror Baby]]", who can banish themselves from the GY to prevent the opponent from targeting the player's "Gimmick Puppet" monsters with card effects as well as activating effects in response to their effects activation respectively, securing the Deck from handtraps even more. As if it wasn't enough, it can also Special Summon a monster from the player's GY to the opponent's field, allowing for example to Special Summon an Xyz monster to the opponent's field and burn them through the effect of "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder]]".

  "[[Gimmick Puppet Little Soldiers]]" can send a "Gimmick Puppet" from the Deck to the GY upon Summon to change its Level to that monster, having a Level 8 body already present to the field and setting up the GY. It may also banish itself from the GY to increase the Level of up to 2 "Gimmick Puppet" monsters by 4, making the Level 4 options for that Deck more appealing. "[[Gimmick Puppet Rouge Doll]]" can reveal an Xyz monster in the Extra Deck in order to Special Summon herself from the hand as well as a "Gimmick Puppet" from the Deck with the same Level as that Xyz monster. In addition, "[[Gimmick Puppet Rouge Doll]]" adds herself back from the GY to the hand when she is sent there, except from the hand, making it a great "[[Mill Deck]]" target as well as excellent follow-up. "[[Gimmick Puppet Cattle Scream]]" can Special Summon itself from the hand or GY by detaching an Xyz material from the player's monsters, being an extender, but can also give the Xyz monsters that use it as material the effect to Special Summon monsters from the opponent's GY once per turn in order to facilitate the use of "[[Number 15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Grinder]]" and "[[Number C15: Gimmick Puppet Giant Hunter]]"'s effects.

  "[[Gimmick Puppet Fantasix Machinix]]" can search a "[[Rank-Up]]" Spell card, giving easy access to "[[Rank-Up-Magic Argent Chaos Force]]" for bringing out the "C" version of the Archetype's Ace monsters faster, as well as providing the player an additional Normal Summon for a "Gimmick Puppet" monster, adding greater usage for "[[Gimmick Puppet Scissor Arms]]" and "[[Gimmick Puppet Terror Baby]]". On top of that, when a "Gimmick Puppet" Xyz monster is Special Summoned, "[[Gimmick Puppet Fantasix Machinix]]" can Special Summon itself back from the GY to either side of the field and recover a "[[Rank-Up]]" from the GY in order to extend.
