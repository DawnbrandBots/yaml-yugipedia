  "'''Heroic'''" (ヒロイック ''Hiroikku'', written as {{Ruby|Ｈ|ヒロイック}} in the anime) is an [[archetype]] of [[Warrior]] monsters used by [[Nistro]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime. All [[Main Deck]] and some [[Extra Deck]] members of this archetype are [[EARTH]] monsters, except for the [[LIGHT]] "[[Heroic Champion - Excalibur]]" and "[[Heroic Champion - Claivesolish]]", as well as the [[DARK]] "[[Number 86: Heroic Champion - Rhongomyniad]]". They also have effects that allow them to get stronger via [[ATK]] manipulation. Their crest is a crimson [[wikipedia:Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], which symbolizes the undying fighting spirit within Nistro.
  In the anime, "[[Heroic Challenger]]" and "[[Heroic Champion]]" were both archetypes. In the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'', most of their [[support]] cards were changed to be support for all "Heroic" monsters.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Heroic" archetype focuses on [[swarm]]ing the [[field]] with Level 4 Warrior monsters to perform Xyz Summons, and performing an [[OTK]] by rapidly stacking large amounts of [[ATK]] boosts on a single "Heroic" Xyz Monster. Secondarily, the "Heroic" archetype focuses on putting the player below 500 LP, in order to enable additional effects from its cards.
  "[[Heroic Challenger - Thousand Blades]]", "[[Heroic Challenger - Morning Star|Morning Star]]", and "[[Heroic Challenger - Knuckle Sword|Knuckle Sword]]" are the archetype's key swarming monsters.
  * "Morning Star" and "Knuckle Sword" are extenders from hand, with "Morning Star" also searching a "Heroic" Spell/Trap on Summon. "[[Heroic Challenger - Assault Halberd|Assault Halberd]]" can provide an additional Special Summon when going second.
  * "Thousand Blades" can [[Summon]] a "Heroic" monster directly from the [[Deck]] by discarding a "Heroic" card, but locks the player into only Special Summoning "Heroic" monsters for the rest of the turn. While the restriction is significant, "Thousand Blades" itself is very powerful, as it can Summon another "Thousand Blades" for more Summons, or to Summon "Morning Star" or "[[Heroic Challenger - Clasp Sword]]" for searches.
  For Spell/Trap support, "[[Heroic Envoy]]" is the archetype's main search Spell, with a GY recovery effect if the player is at 500 LP or less. "[[Heroic Call]]" is a Warrior-specific "[[Monster Reborn]]", with an additional GY ATK boost effect if the player is at 500 LP or less.
  To OTK the opponent, the Deck typically stacks multiple ATK-boosting effects on a single "Heroic" Xyz Monster, with cards like "[[Heroic Chance]]", "[[Heroic Champion - Excalibur]]", "[[Heroic Champion - Claivesolish]]", and the GY effect of "Heroic Call". Combined, these effects can typically skyrocket the ATK of one "Heroic" monster into 10,000 or even 20,000 ATK.
  Because the effect of "[[Heroic Champion - Claivesolish]]" reduces the player's [[LP]] to only 500, "[[Number C39: Utopia Ray]]" can become a useful tool to allow a monster boosted by "[[Heroic Chance]]" and "Claiomh Solais" to deal tremendous amounts of damage, while "[[Number S39: Utopia Prime]]" can also easily remove a good chunk of the opponent's defenses and leave them incredibly vulnerable. LP difference-based cards in general may become of high value, as well. "[[Promotion]]" can also effectively turn a monster such as "Clasp Sword" into another Level 4 monster for Xyz Summoning.

  === Weakness ===
  * As with all [[Special Summon]]-based [[Deck]]s, "Heroic" can be shut down by stopping or punishing Special Summons, like with "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" or "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]".
  * "Heroic" is a battle-oriented Deck, so cards that stop or punish attacking like "[[Threatening Roar]]" will affect this Deck negatively.
