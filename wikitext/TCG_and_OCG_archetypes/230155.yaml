  "'''ZW -'''", short for "'''Zexal Weapon'''" ({{Ruby|ＺＷ|ゼアル・ウェポン}} ''Zearu Wepon''), is an [[archetype]] of [[Monster Card|monsters]] with various [[Attribute]]s (primarily [[LIGHT]]) and [[Type]]s (primarily [[Beast]]) used by [[Yuma Tsukumo]] and [[Astral]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'', created through the power of [[ZEXAL (power)|ZEXAL]] via the [[Shining Draw]]. All "ZW -" act as [[support]] cards for "[[Number 39: Utopia]]" and its [[Utopia (archetype)|evolved forms]]. "ZW -" monsters can be [[equip]]ped to "Utopia" monsters from the [[hand]] or [[field]]. They grant "Utopia" monsters an increase in [[ATK]] or [[DEF]], as well as new [[effect]]s. They are also closely related to the "[[ZS -]]" archetype.

  ==Story==
  "ZEXAL Weapons" debuted during Yuma and Astral's Duel against [[Kite Tenjo]] within the [[Emperor's Key#Pocket Dimension|Pocket Dimension]] of the Emperor's Key, being created through a [[Shining Draw]] using the [[ZEXAL (power)|ZEXAL]] power. Each "ZW -" card is created to help Yuma and Astral overcome an opponent's monster they can't otherwise defeat. "[[ZW - Unicorn Spear]]" was the first "ZEXAL Weapon" to be created in order to counter the [[banish]]ing effect of "[[Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon]]" and defeat [[Kite Tenjo|Kite]]. It destroyed "Galaxy-Eyes", but Kite forced a draw.

  During their Duel with [[Trey]], "[[ZW - Phoenix Bow]]" was created to inflict damage to Trey, which the effects of "[[Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis]]" made near impossible otherwise.
  Later on, in the [[WDC]] final, "[[ZW - Lightning Blade]]", "[[ZW - Tornado Bringer]]", and "[[ZW - Leo Arms]]" were created to allow "[[Number C39: Utopia Ray]]" fight Vetrix's seemingly unbeatable "[[Number 69: Heraldry Crest]]" on equal footing. "[[ZW - Ultimate Shield]]" then was created to turn the table on [[Dr. Faker]]/[[Vector]]'s destruction-defying "[[Number 92: Heart-eartH Dragon]]" in the final battle.

  In the [[Barian Invasion]] arc, "[[ZW - Eagle Claw]]" was formed to counter [[Alito]]'s numerous usage of [[Counter Trap Card]]s. After that, "[[ZW - Asura Strike]]" and "[[ZW - Sleipnir Mail]]" were created to counter [[Number 96 (character)|Number 96]]'s array of "[[Number C]]" monsters.

  When Dueling against [[Reginald Kastle|Shark/Nash]] for the final time, "[[ZW - Sylphid Wing]]" was created and used along with "[[Double or Nothing!]]" in a final attempt to defeat "[[CXyz Barian Hope]]". By using its effect to allow "Utopia" to stop its own attack, Yuma prevented "Utopia" from triggering "[[Glory of the Seven Emperors]]" and won the Duel. No more "ZW -" were created after this; but two "[[ZS -]]" (Zexal Servers) were created prior to the Duel between Yuma and Nash: "[[ZS - Vanish Sage]]" and "[[ZS - Ouroboros Sage]]".

  During the [[Barian Invasion#The Battle of Sargasso|Battle of Sargasso]], when ZEXAL was thrown into an alternate form caused by [[Chaos (power)|the darkness]] within Astral, and the subsequent initiation of ZEXAL resulted in [[Dark ZEXAL]], Astral performed a [[Dark Draw]], resulting in the creation of a "'''DZW -'''". The only "DZW" is "[[DZW - Chimera Clad|Chimera Clad]]", which was created to grant "Utopia Ray V" the ability to prevent itself from being destroyed in battle, as well as doubling its ATK and allowing it to attack again.

  ==Design==
  The "ZW -" monsters are based on a combination of mythical beasts and weapons/equipments.

  ==Weaknesses and Counter-Strategies==
  * "[[Ice Beast Zerofyne]]" is a particularly strong counter to the "ZW -" Equip Cards, given that they all have to be face-up to trigger their effects, and lock up their owner's Spell & Trap Card Zones.
  * Since the power of the archetype hinges almost exclusively on "[[Number 39: Utopia]]" and the search capabilities of "[[ZW - Leo Arms]]". "[[Prohibition]]" or "[[Psi-Blocker]]" can effectively shut down the archetype.
  * Non-targeting cards like "[[Book of Eclipse]]", "[[Begone, Knave!]]", "[[Pole Position]]", "[[Photon Alexandra Queen]]", "[[Wall of Illusion]]" (if attacked), etc. can easily remove the equipped monster from field. "[[Numeral Hunter]]" can perfectly counter a "Utopia" protected by the "[[ZW - Lightning Blade]]" and "[[ZW - Tornado Bringer]]" combo.
  * "[[Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon]]" , "[[Number 62: Galaxy-Eyes Prime Photon Dragon]]" and "[[Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]" are effective against "Utopia" monsters when equipped with "ZW -" cards (unless "Tornado Bringer, Unicorn Spear, or Pegasus Twin Saber" is used). "Prime Photon Dragon" can destroy it by battle with a massive ATK boost, and "Tachyon Dragon" will negate all ATK boosts (but not the other "ZW -" effects).
