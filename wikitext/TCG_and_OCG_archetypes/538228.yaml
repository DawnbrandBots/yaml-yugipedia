  "'''Chrysalis'''", known as "'''Cocoon'''" ({{Ruby|Ｃ|コクーン}} ''Kokūn'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of monsters used by [[Jaden Yuki]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. These monsters are younger forms of the "[[Neo-Spacian]]" monsters. There are six "Chrysalis" monsters with different [[Attribute]]s and [[Type]]s, and each one has 200 [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] and 1 [[Level]] less than its corresponding "Neo-Spacian" monster. With the exception of "[[Chrysalis Dolphin]]", they also have the same Type as their "Neo-Spacian" form.
  Despite this archetype's ''[[TCG]]'' name being changed to "Chrysalis", many of the support [[Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s still contain "Cocoon".

  == Playing style ==
  Each "Chrysalis" monster can be [[Tribute]]d when the [[Field Spell Card]] "[[Neo Space]]" is on the [[field]] to [[Special Summon]] a specified "[[Neo-Spacian]]" monster from either the player's [[hand]] or [[Deck]].
  With the use of "[[Cocoon Party]]", it becomes possible to use the "Chrysalis" monsters alongside the "Neo-Spacian" monsters and various [[Level]] 3 monsters to help set up "Neo-Spacian" monsters in the [[GY]] through "[[Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss]]" to make a field of [[Link Monster]]s such as "[[Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess]]". However, the 5 "Chrysalis" monsters used for "Cocoon Party" do not contribute much to the hands they are [[draw]]n in unless their [[Type]] or [[Attribute]] is required for a particular monster trying to be Summoned, as well said hand needing to be able to accommodate that monster as the [[Normal Summon]], such as using "[[Chrysalis Chicky]]" for "[[Simorgh, Bird of Sovereignty]]". Another downside is that having more than 5 "Neo-Spacian" monsters with different names in the GY will make "Cocoon Party" unable to resolve its effect, however this can be avoided by only running 5 different "Neo-Spacian" monsters. Using "[[Instant Contact]]" to Summon "[[Neo-Spacian Marine Dolphin]] to use as a [[Link Material]] will get two "Neo-Spacian" names in the GY at once due to also being treated as "[[Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin]]", allowing Cocoon Party to summon two Chrysalis monsters from deck for putting "Marine Dolphin" into the GY. Due to the deck utilizing "Neo-Spacian" monsters, the deck is also capable utilizing "[[Small World]]" effectively, as they are all Level 3 monsters of different Types and Attributes from each other, while only [[Neo-Spacian Flare Scarab]] and [[Neo-Spacian Dark Panther]] share the same [[Defense]].
