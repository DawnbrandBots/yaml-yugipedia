  "'''The Agent'''" ({{Ruby|代|だい}}{{Ruby|行|こう}}{{Ruby|者|しゃ}} ''Daikōsha'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] [[Fairy]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. The archetype was introduced in ''[[Ancient Sanctuary]]'', and was slowly expanded over the course of more than a decade. Two [[Structure Deck]]s in particular are dedicated to the archetype, ''[[Lost Sanctuary Structure Deck]]'' (''[[TCG]]'')/''[[Structure Deck: Lost Sanctuary]]'' (''[[OCG]]''), and the [[Structure Deck R]] ''[[Structure Deck R: Lost Sanctuary]]''.
  The archetype is related to the [[Field Spell Card]] "[[The Sanctuary in the Sky]]", and is also related to the "[[Hyperion]]" archetype of monsters.
  ==Members==
  Each "The Agent" monster is based on a different celestial body, usually a [[wikipedia:Planet|planet]]. Each monster is named as "The Agent of [Property] - [Planet]".

  The "[[Hyperion]]" monsters serve as the boss monsters for "The Agent" archetype, and they represent the [[wikipedia:Sun|Sun]] in the archetype's celestial body theme.
  ==Playing style==
  "The Agent" archetype features multiple monsters with a diverse array of effects. The archetype is strongly related to the [[Field Spell]] "[[The Sanctuary in the Sky]]" and its [[The Sanctuary in the Sky (series)|supporting card series]], as well as the "[[Hyperion]]" archetype, who cross-support "The Agent" archetype and the The Sanctuary in the Sky series. Generally, "The Agent" [[Deck]]s focus on utilizing archetypal [[support]], "Sanctuary"-related support, and general [[Fairy]]-[[Type]] support to perform combos and build boards.
  Though the archetype features many monsters, many of them had become obsolete due to their old age. The current key "The Agent" monsters that facilitate their main combos are "[[The Agent of Creation - Venus|Venus]]", "[[The Agent of Life - Neptune|Neptune]]", and "[[The Agent of Mystery - Earth|Earth]]". Most "The Agent" monsters, including "Neptune" and "Earth", can be searched by "Sanctuary"-related support; "Venus" however, is a notable exception.
  * "Venus" can non-[[once per turn]] [[Special Summon]] a "[[Mystical Shine Ball]]" from the [[hand]] or Deck by [[pay]]ing 500 [[LP]], allowing a rapid [[swarm]]ing of monsters on the [[field]] for [[Link Summon]]s. However, some Decks forgo "Venus" due to the space taken up by the "Mystical Shine Ball" monsters, and focus on combos involving "Neptune" and "Earth" instead.
  * "Neptune" can be [[discard]]ed to Special Summon any "The Agent" monster from the [[hand]] or [[GY]], enabling more advanced combos by reviving needed monsters. It can also search out "[[The Sanctuary in the Sky]]" if it's [[banish]]ed, enabling the effects of many "Sanctuary"-related cards.
  * "Earth", if [[Normal Summon]]ed, can search out any "The Agent" monster (except for itself), or "[[Master Hyperion]]" if "The Sanctuary in the Sky" is on the field. It can enable many complex combos by searching out "Neptune", such as the "[[Crystron Halqifibrax]]" combos, as "Earth" is a [[Tuner monster]].
  The archetype has a small number of [[Extra Deck]] monsters: "[[Protector of The Agents - Moon|Moon]]" is a [[Link Rating|Link]]-2 [[Link Monster]] that can be easily Summoned by "Venus", and [[mill]]s additional "Sanctuary"-related cards to enable more combos. "[[The Executor of the Underworld - Pluto|Pluto]]" is a [[Level]] 5 [[Tuner Synchro Monster]] with a situational [[Quick Effect]] which focuses on [[flip]] disruption.
  The "[[Hyperion]]" monsters, consisting of the Main Deck "[[Master Hyperion]]", "[[Majesty Hyperion]]", and the Extra Deck [[Synchro Monster]] "[[Masterflare Hyperion]]", are the archetype's main boss monsters. Both Main Deck "Hyperion" monsters can be searched by "Sanctuary"-related support.
  * "Master" and "Majesty" are both [[Special Summon]]ed by [[banish]]ing 1 "The Agent" from the player's [[hand]], [[field]] or [[GY]]; "Master" can be Special Summoned any number of times per turn, but can only be Summoned from the hand, while "Majesty" can Special Summon itself from the hand or GY, but can only do so once per turn. On the field, both can banish a [[LIGHT]] [[Fairy]] monster from the GY to damage the opponent: "Master" destroys an opponent's card, while "Majesty" banishes 1 card in either GY.
  * "Masterflare" is a [[Level]] 10 Synchro Monster that can be Summoned in-archetype using "Earth" and another Main Deck "Hyperion" monster. It can copy the effects of 1 "The Agent" monster or 1 "Sanctuary"-related monster, enabling a large variety of advanced combos (such as by copying "Venus"). It also has a [[Quick Effect]] which focuses on [[banish]] disruption.
  "[[The Sacred Waters in the Sky]]" is a [[Spell Card]] that searches "Sanctuary"-related monsters, making it functionally the archetype's main searcher, though it cannot search "Venus". Likewise, "[[The Chorus in the Sky]]" is a recovery Spell card for "Sanctuary"-related cards.
  Externally, the archetype strongly supports "Sanctuary"-related cards thanks to its searchers and combo enablers, and is also is strongly supported by "Sanctuary"-related support cards, such as "[[Celestial Knightlord Parshath]]" (who additonally enables using the boss monster "[[Archlord Kristya]]"). The archetype also benefits greatly from general [[Fairy]] support, with "[[Diviner of the Herald]]" being an especially strong support for the archetype, as it can 1-card combo (using "[[Trias Hierarchia]]") to enable the summon of either "[[Masterflare Hyperion]]" or "[[Protector of The Agents - Moon]]".
  The archetype's focus on [[LIGHT]] [[Attribute]] lets it benefit from general LIGHT support, and, if hybridized with [[DARK]] monsters (such as historically in "[[T.G.]]" and [[Emergency Teleport|Tele]]-Agents), can support a variety of [[Chaos]] boss monsters. Lastly, the archetype has the capacity to Summon powerful [[Level]] 10 [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] and [[Rank]] 8 [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]] boss monsters.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Due to the LIGHT monster emphasis, anti-LIGHT cards such as "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]" can shut down the deck.
  * Anti-GY floodgates, such as "[[Necrovalley]]", "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", and "[[Macro Cosmos]]", can significantly damage the deck's ability to make combos and summon "Hyperion" monsters.
  * This archetype relies heavily on "[[The Sanctuary in the Sky]]", meaning cards that can destroy spells such as "[[Spell Shattering Arrow]]" or "[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]" must be made a priority and taken care of.
  ==Trivia==
  * [[Tori Meadows]] often uses "The Agent" monsters in video games, despite not using them in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime or manga. This is a reference to her Japanese voice actress [[Mikako Komatsu]] using a "The Agent" Deck in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game]]'' tournaments involving ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' voice actors.{{citation needed}}
