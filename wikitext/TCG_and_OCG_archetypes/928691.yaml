  "'''Infernoble Arms'''", known in Japanese as "'''Flame Holy Sword'''" ({{Ruby|焔|えん}}{{Ruby|聖|せい}}{{Ruby|剣|けん}} ''Enseiken'') is a sub-[[archetype]] of the "[[Noble Arms]]" archetype that debuted in ''[[Rise of the Duelist]]'', but only received its first support card in ''[[Duelist Nexus]]''. They are [[Equip Spell Card]]s that have synergy with [[FIRE]] [[Warrior]] monsters, and are closely related to the "[[Infernoble Knight]]" [[archetype]].

  == Design ==
  The "Infernoble Arms" Equip Spells are based on weapons wielded by characters from the epic poem, [[wikipedia:Song of Roland|The Song of Roland]].

  Each "Infernoble Arms" Equip Spell is depicted as a sword in a display case in a museum (as depicted in "[[Noble Arms Museum]]") surrounded by silhouetted onlookers. Their names are also in quotations to further signify their status as museum pieces.

  The archetype's design may be based on a sword alleged to be Charlemagne's [[wikipedia:Joyeuse|Joyeuse]] being displayed in the [[wikipedia:Louvre|Louvre]]; the sword has been used in coronation ceremonies since 1270, over 400 years after Charlemagne's death.
