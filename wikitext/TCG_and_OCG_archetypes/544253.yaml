  "'''Secret Six Samurai'''", known in Japan as the "'''Shadow Six Warmen'''" ({{Ruby|影|かげ}}{{Ruby|六|ろく}}{{Ruby|武|ぶ}}{{Ruby|衆|しゅう}}, ''Kagerokubushū''), are a sub-[[archetype]] of the "[[Six Samurai]]" archetype introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Spirit Warriors]]''/''[[Spirit Warriors]]''.

  ==Design==
  The "Secret Six Samurai" are a ninja-themed sub-archetype of the "Six Samurai".  Much like the originally "Six Samurai" monsters, the archetype features one member for each [[Attribute]] (except [[DIVINE]]). Their crest is different from the others, with kunai-like shapes, keeping the ninja style of the series.

  The design of each "Secret Six Samurai" monster is based on a historical or legendary ninja-related figure from the Sengoku era.

  ==Playing style==
  Unlike other "Six Samurai" monsters who protect themselves from battle destruction by destroying another Six Samurai; the "Secret Six Samurai", fitting their ninja-styled theme, protect other "Six Samurai" monsters from effect destruction by banishing themselves from the Graveyard.
