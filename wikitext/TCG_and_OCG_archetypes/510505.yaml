  "'''Gadget'''" (ガジェット ''Gajetto'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] (with the exception of the [[Cyberse]] "[[Cyberse Gadget]]" and "[[Gadget Token]]") used by [[Yugi Muto]]. This archetype is supported by the "[[Boot-Up]]" series of cards. It also contains members in the "[[Ancient Gear]]" and "[[Morphtronic]]" archetypes, the latter of which was used by [[Leo]] in the anime.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Gadget" archetype focuses on swarming the field with archetypal monsters. While there are many boss monsters that use "Gadgets", such as "[[Powerhold the Moving Battery]]", "[[Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon]]", and "[[Boot-Up Admiral - Destroyer Dynamo]]", these have not seen much competitive play.

  Historically, Decks would use the original three members - "[[Red Gadget|Red]]", "[[Green Gadget|Green]]", and "[[Yellow Gadget]]" - for constant card [[advantage]] and recursion, which was rare at the time. These Decks could afford to run lots of one-for-one removal to take out stronger monsters. They benefited from various pieces of indirect support:
  * As Machines, they appreciated Machine support such as "[[Limiter Removal]]", "[[Machina Fortress]]" (a strong boss which could discard Gadgets to summon itself), and "[[Solidarity]]" (which gave "Gadgets" enough ATK to beat over other Normal Summons). 
  * As Level 4 monsters, once [[Xyz Monster]]s were released, they could take advantage of the [[Rank 4 Monster Cards|Rank 4]] pool, as well as monsters that helped summon Rank 4s (e.g., "[[Tin Goldfish]]"). 

  However, the "Gadget" engine was eventually powercrept from the meta, as stronger sources of advantage/recursion generation were introduced.

  The archetype has received some legacy support. Many of these cards were themed around the anime: "[[Gold Gadget|Gold]]" and "[[Silver Gadget]]" were released with the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions Movie Pack]]'', while "[[Gadget Trio]]" is a supporting piece for the "[[Shining Sarcophagus]]" archetype. The "[[Boot-Up]]" series is another piece of dedicated support, though it released too late to be competitively relevant.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As a Machine archetype, it struggles against Machine-counter cards like "[[System Down]]" and "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]", as well as "[[There Can Be Only One]]" (which prevents 2+ Machines from being on field).
  * The original three Gadgets are heavily reliant on their recursion, so cards like "[[Skill Drain]]", "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]", and "[[Mistake]]", which shut down their searching abilities, are great counters.
