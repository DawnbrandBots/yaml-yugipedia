  "'''Heroic Challenger'''" ({{Ruby|Ｈ|ヒロイック}}・{{Ruby|Ｃ|チャレンジャー}} ''Hiroikku Charenjā'', written as {{Ruby|Ｈ・Ｃ|ヒロイック・チャレンジャー}} in the anime), is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]], which are part of the "[[Heroic]]" archetype, that are used by [[Nistro]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime. All monsters of this archetype are [[Level]] 4, except for the Level 1 "[[Heroic Challenger - Ambush Soldier]]", "[[Heroic Challenger - Clasp Sword]]" & "[[Heroic Challenger - Knuckle Sword]]" and the Level 6 "[[Heroic Challenger - War Hammer]]". Its released [[support]] cards were retooled to be "Heroic" support cards in the ''[[OCG]]'' and are listed here as related.
  The archetype primarily consists cards focusing on maintaining a powerful [[field]] presence in order to [[Xyz Summon]] the "[[Heroic Champion]]" monsters, or utilizing the "Heroic" support cards to maintain a large offense or protect their monsters from [[attack]]s (or take their opposition with them). Other cards like "[[Heroic Challenger - Night Watchman]]" help to eliminate threats that would limit the offensive capabilities of the other "Heroic" monsters. The main consistency with this archetype, as well as the other "Heroic" cards is to either increase the [[ATK]] of their monsters, utilizing this to create strong field presence and focus on [[battle damage]] to defeat opposition, or to utilize effects (that rely on monster presence) to eliminate the opponents monsters so that on the following turn, the opponent will have lost their field presence. The latter of these functions rather well with the former, granting a more open field for your high-attack monsters to create large battle damage and dominate the opposition's monsters.
