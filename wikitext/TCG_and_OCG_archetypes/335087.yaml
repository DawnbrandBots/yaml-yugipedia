  "'''Abyss Script'''" ({{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|界|かい}}{{Ruby|台|だい}}{{Ruby|本|ほん}} ''Makai Daihon'')  is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card]]s related to the "[[Abyss Actor]]" archetype, both of which are used by [[Sylvio Sawatari]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. All cards of this archetype are [[Normal Spell Card]]s, except for the [[Continuous Spell Card]] "[[Abyss Script - Abysstainment]]".
  Besides their basic effects, each one have an effect that can only be activated if they are destroyed by an opponent's card effect while [[Set]] on its [[owner]]'s field, and its owner has a face-up "Abyss Actor" Pendulum Monster in their [[Extra Deck]].
  The sole "Abyss Prop" card, "[[Abyss Prop - Wild Wagon]]", is similar to "Abyss Script" cards, having the same activation condition for its [[Trigger-like Effect]] as "Abyss Script" cards despite not being one.
