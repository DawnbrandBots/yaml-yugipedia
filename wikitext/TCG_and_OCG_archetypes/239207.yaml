  '''"Heraldry"''', known as '''"Medallion"''' (メダリオン ''Medarion'', written as {{Ruby|紋章|メダリオン}} in the anime) in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of cards used by [[Vetrix]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime.

  The "Heraldry" archetype largely serves as support for the "[[Heraldic Beast]]" archetype, and consists mostly of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card|Trap]] cards. The archetype itself lacks a single form of cohesive gameplay, instead augmenting the abilities of a "Heraldic Beast" Deck. For example; "[[Heraldry Change]]", "[[Heraldry Reborn]]" and "[[Advanced Heraldry Art]]" all feature effects which [[Special Summon]] "[[Heraldic Beast]]" monsters for quicker [[Xyz Summon]]s. "[[Heraldry Record]]" serves a defensive purpose in line with the archetype's anti-Xyz monster effects, [[negate|negating]] the [[activate|activation]] of an Xyz Monster's effect.

  The archetype features only four monster cards, "[[Number 69: Heraldry Crest]]," its retrains "[[Number 69: Heraldry Crest - Shatter Stream]]" and "[[Number 69: Heraldry Crest - Dark Matter Demolition]]", and its "[[Number C]]" counterpart "[[Number C69: Heraldry Crest of Horror]]." The original duo are respectively the second-to-the-most and most powerful [[Psychic]] Xyz Monsters in the game in terms of [[ATK]], and have devastating anti-Xyz effects. "Number 69" negates the effects of all Xyz Monsters when it come into play, and once per turn can adopt the name and effects of one Xyz Monster in play. Its upgraded counterpart, "Number C69" not only features a staggering 4000 ATK (the highest of all Psychic and [[Rank 5 Monster Cards]]), but features a passive effect that [[destroy]]s all cards the opponent controls whenever they attack. In addition, if Summoned by a "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" card using [[Number 69: Heraldry Crest|its original form]], it gains the ability to absorb the ATK and effects of one Xyz Monster per turn, making its ATK soar to ever-higher levels.

  "Shatter Stream" and "Dark Matter Demolition" deviate from the original two. "Shatter Stream" is merely a bridge between the original monster and "Dark Matter Demolition" (with the destruction of an opposing monster in the transition), but "Dark Matter Demolition" features a unique gimmick (shared with the [[Quick-Play Spell]] "[[Flash of Heraldry]]", which does this to as many opposing monster as the player wants) of turning a monster's name into "[[Unknown]]" and preventing the effects of monsters named "Unknown" from resolving.   

  "[[Augmented Heraldry]]" is a [[Field Spell Card]] that supports both the "Heraldry" archetype and the "Heraldic Beasts" by protecting Psychic Xyz Monsters from Spell and Trap effects, but can search other "Heraldry" Spell/Trap Cards by [[discard]]ing "Heraldic Beasts" (whose effects work best while in the [[Graveyard]]).
