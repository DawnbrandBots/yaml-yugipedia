  "'''Spiritual Beast'''" ({{Ruby|精|せい}}{{Ruby|霊|れい}}{{Ruby|獣|じゅう}} ''Seireijū''), known as "'''Spiritual Beast Avatar'''" in other ''[[TCG]]'' languages, is a sub-[[archetype]] of "[[Ritual Beast]]" that debuted in ''[[Booster SP: Tribe Force]]''. They are used as [[Fusion Material]]s to [[Contact Fusion]] the "[[Ritual Beast Ulti]]" [[Fusion Monster]]s, along with the "[[Ritual Beast Tamer]]" [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They are [[Level]] 4 [[WIND]] monsters whose [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] have a sum of 2000, and their [[Monster effect|effects]] are based on banishing other "Ritual Beasts" from the [[hand]] or [[Main Deck|Deck]] in order to setup the "[[De-Fusion]]"-like effect of the "Ritual Beast Ulti" [[Fusion Monster]]s.

  As with all other "Ritual Beast" cards, this archetype is named differently in non-English ''TCG'' languages due to the difference in word orders making the sub-archetype pun no longer functional.
