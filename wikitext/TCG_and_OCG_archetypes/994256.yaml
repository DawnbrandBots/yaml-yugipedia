  ===Members===
  * [[Armored Xyz]]
  * [[Full-Armored Xyz]]

  ===Support/Related===
  The "Armored Xyz" Spell and Trap cards are supported by and/or thematically related to two [[series]] of OCG/TCG-original [[Xyz Monsters]], "Xyz Armor" and "Full Armored". Both are based on Xyz Monsters used by [[Reginald Kastle|Reginald "Shark" Kastle]] from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'', who was the the primary user of the "Armored Xyz" cards in the anime.

  * "Xyz Armor": Retrains of Kastle's mechanical [[Shark (series)|Shark]]-formed Xyz Monsters in humanoid form.
  * "Full Armored": Retrains of Kastle's ace Xyz Monsters, shown equipped with Kastle's other Xyz Monsters; excluding "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]", each "Full Armored" monster has a counterpart depiction in the anime.

  ==Playing style==
  "Armored Xyz" is a theme centered on the use of the "[[Armored Xyz]]" [[Spell Card]] and its upgraded [[Trap Card]] equivalent, "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]", to [[Equip|equip]] Xyz Monsters from your [[Graveyard|GY]] to another monster you control and build towards a larger boss monster in the form of "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]", which is able to utilize the effects of "[[Xyz Armor Torpedo]]" and "[[Xyz Armor Fortress]]" while equipped to attack for large damage as well as the effects "Dark Knight Lancer" to gain ATK for each material and equipped card it has as well as the ability to attach an opponent's monster to itself as a material.

  While the "Armored Xyz" can be played as a standalone Deck, the theme can also be played as a package in any Decks that uses [[WATER]] Xyz monsters between Rank 3 to 5 by simply stacking them on top of one another.
