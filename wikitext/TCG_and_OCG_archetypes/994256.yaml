  "'''Armored Xyz'''" (アーマード・エクシーズ ''Āmādo Ekushīzu'') is an [[archetype]] of Spell and Trap cards that debuted in ''[[Animation Chronicle 2023]]'' before receiving direct support in ''[[Age of Overlord]]''.

  ==Design==

  ===Members===
  * [[Armored Xyz]]
  * [[Full-Armored Xyz]]

  ===Support/Related===
  The "Armored Xyz" Spell and Trap cards are supported by and/or thematically related to two [[series]] of OCG/TCG-original [[Xyz Monsters]], "Xyz Armor" and "Full Armored". Both are based on Xyz Monsters used by [[Reginald Kastle|Reginald "Shark" Kastle]] from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'', who was the primary user of the "Armored Xyz" cards in the anime.

  * "Xyz Armor": Retrains of Kastle's mechanical [[Shark (archetype)|Shark]]-formed Xyz Monsters in humanoid form.
  * "Full Armored": Retrains of Kastle's ace Xyz Monsters, shown equipped with Kastle's other Xyz Monsters; excluding "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]", each "Full Armored" monster has a counterpart depiction in the anime.

  ==Playing style==
  "Armored Xyz" is a theme centered on the use of the "[[Armored Xyz]]" [[Spell Card]] and its upgraded [[Trap Card]] equivalent, "[[Full-Armored Xyz]]", to [[Equip|equip]] Xyz Monsters from your [[Graveyard|GY]] to another monster you control and build towards a larger boss monster in the form of "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]", which is able to utilize the effects of "[[Xyz Armor Torpedo]]" and "[[Xyz Armor Fortress]]" while equipped to attack for large damage as well as the effects "Dark Knight Lancer" to gain ATK for each material and equipped card it has as well as the ability to attach an opponent's monster to itself as a material.

  Due to their [[WATER]] [[Attribute]] and overlapping types of effects and synergistic monsters, the theme largely sees play in "[[Shark (archetype)|Shark]]" and other such Decks that center around aggro-based Xyz combos.

  While "Armored Xyz" can be played as a standalone Deck, the theme can also be played as a package in any Decks that use Xyz Monsters between Ranks 3 to 5 by simply stacking them on top of one another (also known as performing [[Xyz Evolution]]). Examples include "[[Phantom Knights]]" and "[[Goblin Biker]]" for their abundance of Level/Rank 3 monsters, as well as "[[Time Thief]]" for its synergy between its [[Continuous Trap]], "[[Time Thief Power Reserve|Power Reserve]]", and "Full-Armored Xyz". With the aforementioned combination, it is possible to tap into a wide toolbox of Rank 4 monsters such as "[[Time Thief Redoer]]", "[[Time Thief Double Barrel]]", and "[[Abyss Dweller]]" during the opponent's turn. "[[Number 60: Dugares the Timeless]]" can also make for apt material to Summon "Xyz Armor Fortress" due to its effect to detach both materials and either draw two cards then discard one or revive a monster in GY, simultaneously generating card advantage and exhausting its materials so "Armor Fortress" can immediately be made into "Dark Knight Lancer" after searching "Armored Xyz" cards.
