  "'''Stealth Kragen'''" (ステルス・クラーゲン ''Suterusu Kurāgen'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Rank]] 4 [[WATER]] [[Aqua]] [[Xyz Monster]]s used by [[Chironex]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]''.

  ==Design==
  "Stealth Kragen" monsters are based on the ''[[wikipedia:Turritopsis dohrnii|Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which is commonly known as the immortal jellyfish. The immortal jellyfish can reset its life cycle by reverting to larval form instead of dying, which is reflected by the "Stealth Kragen" monsters being able to Special Summon copies of each other to the [[field]] upon [[destroy|destruction]].

  ===Etymology===
  ''Kurāgen'' (クラーゲン) in this archetype's Japanese name is a portmanteau of ''kurage'' (海月, the Japanese word for "[[wikipedia:Jellyfish|jellyfish]]") and "[[wikipedia:Kraken|Kraken]]" (クラーケン ''kurāken'' in Japanese). In English, this is localized as "Kragen"—"Kraken" with the second "k" replaced by a "g", equivalent to the change made to the Japanese word for "Kraken" in this card's Japanese name.

  ==Playing strategy==
  "Stealth Kragen" monsters can Special Summon copies of each other to the [[field]] upon [[destroy|destruction]]. The other main strategy is to make all monsters on the field [[WATER]]-[[Attribute]], so that they can easily be destroyed by the [[Quick Effect]]s of "Stealth Kragen" monsters, and in the case of "[[Number 4: Stealth Kragen]]" damaging the opponent's [[LP]] as well.

  Because their central monster, "[[Number 4: Stealth Kragen]]", requires Level 4 WATER monsters as materials, it is an excellent boss monster option for the "[[Shark (archetype)|Shark]]" archetype, who specializes in swarming Level 4 WATER monsters for Xyz plays.
