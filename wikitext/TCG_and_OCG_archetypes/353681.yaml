  "'''Flower Cardian'''", known as "'''Cardian'''" ({{Ruby|花札衛|カーディアン}} ''Kādian'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Chojiro Tokumatsu]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' based on [[wikipedia:Hanafuda|hanafuda]] playing cards.

  == Design ==
  [[File:Cardian.png|200px|left|thumb|[[Chojiro Tokumatsu]] with "[[Flower Cardian Willow (anime)|Flower Cardian Willow]]", "[[Flower Cardian Paulownia (anime)|Flower Cardian Paulownia]]", "[[Flower Cardian Zebra Grass (anime)|Flower Cardian Zebra Grass]]", and "[[Flower Cardian Pine (anime)|Flower Cardian Pine]]" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V|anime]].]]
  "Flower Cardian" [[Monster Card|monsters]] look like giant [[wikipedia:Hanafuda|hanafuda]] cards. The images depicted in them appear to be parodies of the images depicted in the actual playing cards using ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' cards; for example, the image depicted on "[[Flower Cardian Pine with Crane]]" is a parody of the image depicted in the "[[wikipedia:File:Kintengu_01s.png|Crane Matsu]]" card with "[[Crane Crane]]".
  {{-|left}}

  === Etymology ===
  In Japanese, "Cardian" is written with kanji meaning "Hanafuda" and "Protection". The reading "Cardian" is a pun on "Card" and "Guardian". In English, the addition of the word "Flower" may reflect the fact that "Hanafuda" is written with kanji meaning "Flower" and "Card".

  === Members ===
  Each Main Deck monster's [[Level]] is equal to the month represented by its suit; for example, "Matsu" is the first suit, so "[[Flower Cardian Pine]]" and "[[Flower Cardian Pine with Crane]]" are both Level 1. The [[ATK]]/[[DEF]] of each is equal to 100 times its point value in hanafuda; for example, the "Susuki" hanafuda card is worth 1 point and "[[Flower Cardian Zebra Grass]]" has 100 ATK/DEF, while the "Full Moon with Red Sky Susuki" card is worth 20 points and "[[Flower Cardian Zebra Grass with Moon]]" has 2000 ATK/DEF.

  The Extra Deck monsters are based on ''[[wikipedia:Koi-Koi#Yaku listing|yaku]]'' (combos) in Koi-Koi, a game played with hanafuda cards. Due to the fact that "Flower Cardian" Tuners can treat all of the Synchro Materials as Level 2 for a Synchro Summon using them as material, the Levels of "Flower Cardian" Synchro Monsters are twice the number of cards required for the ''hanafuda'' combo, so that the "Flower Cardians" that correspond to the ''hanafuda'' combo cards can be used to Synchro Summon them.

  == Playing style ==
  This archetype revolves around performing plays that mirror plays from hanafuda games. Their effects allow the player to Tribute the "Flower Cardian" monsters worth 1 point in hanafuda games on their [[field]] to Special Summon the monster of matching Level worth 20 points from their [[hand]], which will then allow the player to draw 1 card. If the drawn card is a "Flower Cardian" who has another of matching Level on the field, the player can keep Special Summoning "Flower Cardian" monsters and drawing cards. This arrangement is meant to gather the right cards on the field to perform a combination named "Yaku", represented by a [[Synchro Summon]].

  The archetype uses cards such as "[[Flower Gathering]]" to gather cards more quickly. Everything revolves around gathering the right cards to perform a "Yaku" and Synchro Summon the [[Synchro Monster]] corresponding to that combo. By using "[[Flower Stacking]]" followed by "[[Super Koi Koi]]" it's possible to summon any Level 4 or 6 Synchro Monster, or a Rank 2 Xyz Monster.

  The "Flower Cardian" Tuners ("[[Flower Cardian Moonflowerviewing]]", "[[Flower Cardian Peony with Butterfly]]", and "[[Flower Cardian Willow with Calligrapher]]") can treat other monsters as Level 2 for a Synchro Summon.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Since the majority of this Deck's card effects rely on drawing "Flower Cardian" monsters to be successful, the Deck makes minimal use of [[hand trap]]s and other generic cards (if any), preventing it from being very responsive to the opponent's plays. This is further enforced by many of their card effects preventing their user from Summoning monsters other than "Flower Cardian" monsters.
  ** Despite this, the Deck's core strength is from drawing many cards in a single turn, allowing them to advance their strategy in spite of the opponent's responses. This strength, however, can be countered with the effects of "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" and "[[Protector of the Sanctuary]]".
  * Cards that prevent Special Summoning, such as "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Vanity's Fiend]]", and "[[Vanity's Ruler]]", will completely shut down this Deck.
  ** With the exception of the [[DARK]]-Attribute "[[Barrier Statue of the Abyss]]", the [[Barrier Statue]] monsters are also very effective, as this Deck is incapable of Normal Summoning any monster with more than 100 ATK to destroy them by battle.
  ** Since this Deck is completely reliant on Special Summoning from the hand several times per turn, it is very vulnerable to the effects of "[[Mulcharmy Purulia]]" and "[[Summoning Curse]]", with the latter especially because of the Deck's continued draws and heavy monster count.
  *** This Deck is especially vulnerable to the effect of "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]", since the Deck rarely has the ability to negate activated monster effects in the hand. However, "Nibiru" is most reliably effective once the "Flower Cardian" player has finished Summoning their [[Synchro Monster]]s for the turn, since the "Flower Cardian" player has the potential to easily resume their combos despite losing all their monsters on the field.
  ** Since this Deck relies on having a "Flower Cardian" monster on the field (typically lower-Level) to allow their other "Flower Cardian" monsters to Special Summon themselves from the hand, eliminating the monster with the lowest Level (or their only monster on the field) can hinder the Deck, by either preventing the "Flower Cardian" player from Special Summoning any further, or forcing them to use a reserve option such as "[[Flower Cardian Cherry Blossom with Curtain|Cherry Blossom with Curtain]]" or "[[Recardination]]".
  <!--Don't mention "Flower Gathering" for the above tip, as the "Flower Cardian" player typically doesn't hold back on using it.-->
  * This Deck has eight separate monsters with 1000 or less ATK, with five monsters that have 2000 ATK.
  ** This renders the Deck vulnerable to the effects of "[[Deck Devastation Virus]]" and "[[King Tiger Wanghu]]", which destroy monsters with less than 1501 ATK and 1401 ATK, respectively.
  ** This Deck is vulnerable to "[[Power Filter]]", since 7 of the eight monsters with 1000 or less ATK frequently Special Summon themselves (and only "[[Flower Cardian Pine|Pine]]" and "[[Flower Cardian Cherry Blossom|Cherry Blossom]]" can be Normal Summoned without Tributing), and the only monster with 2000 ATK that can be Special Summoned without needing to Tribute a monster is "[[Flower Cardian Cherry Blossom with Curtain|Cherry Blossom with Curtain]]".
  *** Since the monsters with 1000 or less ATK frequently Special Summon themselves (and are commonly used in multiple copies), they can be vulnerable to "[[Chain Disappearance]]".
  * Despite this Deck relying on [[Synchro Monster]]s, it is not very vulnerable to Level-changing [[floodgate]]s, since their Tuner monsters all have an effect that treats the [[Synchro Material]]s used for a [[Synchro Summon]] as Level 2 monsters. As a result however, this leaves the Deck vulnerable to effects that counter those Tuner monsters, such as effect negation (e.g. "[[Effect Veiler]]", "[[Infinite Impermanence]]", and "[[Ghost Mourner & Moonlit Chill]]") and preventing them from being used as a Synchro Material (e.g. "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]", "[[Gnomaterial]]", and "[[PSY-Framegear Gamma]]").
  * While not totally reliant on the Graveyard, this Deck's use of the Graveyard enables some of its more powerful card effects, such as "[[De-Synchro]]", "[[Flower Cardian Willow]]", "[[Recardination]]", and "[[Super All In!]]". Therefore, cards such as "[[Banisher of the Radiance]]", "[[Dimension Shifter]]", "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]", and "[[Necrovalley]]" can suppress this Deck.
  ** "[[Called by the Grave]]" can be very devastating to this Deck, if used to banish a key monster such as "[[Flower Cardian Willow]]" (whose effects are typically used many times during a single turn) or "[[Flower Cardian Peony with Butterfly]]" (the more-easily Summoned Tuner monster of the Deck's 2 Main Deck Tuner options, making it unable to use its Level-changing effect).
  * Since several of this Deck's monsters rely on activating their effects to Special Summon themselves from the hand (multiple times a Duel, via multiple copies), "[[Mind Drain]]" can suppress these plays.
  * All "Flower Cardian" monsters are [[DARK]]-Attribute, rendering them vulnerable to anti-DARK floodgates such as "[[Consecrated Light]]", "[[Koa'ki Meiru Drago]]", "[[Koa'ki Meiru Doom]]", and "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]".
  * All "Flower Cardian" monsters are [[Warrior]]-Type, rendering them vulnerable to "[[There Can Be Only One]]".
  * Despite the numerous options for countering this Deck, this Deck has the potential to overcome many of them, due to the effects of "[[Flower Cardian Clover with Boar|Clover with Boar]]" and "[[Flower Cardian Maple with Deer|Maple with Deer]]" (having the potential to destroy a monster or Spell/Trap on the field, respectively), as well as "[[Super Koi Koi]]" (being able to Special Summon up to 3 "Flower Cardian" monsters from the Deck as Level 2 monsters, enabling a follow-up play from the [[Extra Deck]]). Therefore, the most reliable suppressive options are card effects that prevent Special Summoning or negate their monster effects.

  == Trivia ==
  * All "Flower Cardians" are based on ''Kasu'' (1-point cards), ''Tane'' (10-point cards), or ''Hikari'' (20-point cards). There are no "Flower Cardians" based on ''Tanzaku'' (5-point cards).
  * There are no more than two "Flower Cardian" cards of each suit (even of suits that include ''Kasu'', ''Tane'', and ''Hikari'').
