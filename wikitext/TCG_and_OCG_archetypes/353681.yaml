  "'''Flower Cardian'''", known as "'''Cardian'''" ({{Ruby|花札衛|カーディアン}} ''Kādian'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Chojiro Tokumatsu]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' based on [[wikipedia:Hanafuda|hanafuda]] playing cards.

  == Design ==
  [[File:Cardian.png|200px|left|thumb|[[Chojiro Tokumatsu]] with "[[Flower Cardian Willow (anime)|Flower Cardian Willow]]", "[[Flower Cardian Paulownia (anime)|Flower Cardian Paulownia]]", "[[Flower Cardian Zebra Grass (anime)|Flower Cardian Zebra Grass]]", and "[[Flower Cardian Pine (anime)|Flower Cardian Pine]]" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V|anime]].]]
  "Flower Cardian" [[Monster Card|monsters]] look like giant [[wikipedia:Hanafuda|hanafuda]] cards. The images depicted in them appear to be parodies of the images depicted in the actual playing cards using ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' cards; for example, the image depicted on "[[Flower Cardian Pine with Crane]]" is a parody of the image depicted in the "[[wikipedia:File:Kintengu_01s.png|Crane Matsu]]" card with "[[Crane Crane]]".
  {{-|left}}

  === Etymology ===
  In Japanese, "Cardian" is written with kanji meaning "Hanafuda" and "Protection". The reading "Cardian" is a pun on "Card" and "Guardian". In English, the addition of the word "Flower" may reflect the fact that "Hanafuda" is written with kanji meaning "Flower" and "Card".

  === Members ===
  Each Main Deck monster's [[Level]] is equal to the month represented by its suit; for example, "Matsu" is the first suit, so "[[Flower Cardian Pine]]" and "[[Flower Cardian Pine with Crane]]" are both Level 1. The [[ATK]]/[[DEF]] of each is equal to 100 times its point value in hanafuda; for example, the "Susuki" hanafuda card is worth 1 point and "[[Flower Cardian Zebra Grass]]" has 100 ATK/DEF, while the "Full Moon with Red Sky Susuki" card is worth 20 points and "[[Flower Cardian Zebra Grass with Moon]]" has 2000 ATK/DEF.

  The Extra Deck monsters are based on ''[[wikipedia:Koi-Koi#Yaku listing|yaku]]'' (combos) in Koi-Koi, a game played with hanafuda cards. Due to the fact that "Flower Cardian" Tuners can treat all of the Synchro Materials as Level 2 for a Synchro Summon using them as material, the Levels of "Flower Cardian" Synchro Monsters are twice the number of cards required for the ''hanafuda'' combo, so that the "Flower Cardians" that correspond to the ''hanafuda'' combo cards can be used to Synchro Summon them.

  == Playing style ==
  This archetype revolves around performing plays that mirror plays from hanafuda games. Their effects allow the player to Tribute the "Flower Cardian" monsters worth 1 point in hanafuda games on their [[field]] to Special Summon the monster of matching Level worth 20 points from their [[hand]], which will then allow the player to draw 1 card. If the drawn card is a "Flower Cardian" who has another of matching Level on the field, the player can keep Special Summoning "Flower Cardian" monsters and drawing cards. This arrangement is meant to gather the right cards on the field to perform a combination named "Yaku", represented by a [[Synchro Summon]].
  The archetype uses cards such as "[[Flower Gathering]]" to gather cards more quickly. Everything revolves around gathering the right cards to perform a "Yaku" and Synchro Summon the [[Synchro Monster]] corresponding to that combo. By using "[[Flower Stacking]]" followed by "[[Super Koi Koi]]" it's possible to summon any Level 4 or 6 Synchro Monster, or a Rank 2 Xyz Monster.
  The "Flower Cardian" Tuners ("[[Flower Cardian Moonflowerviewing]]", "[[Flower Cardian Peony with Butterfly]]", and "[[Flower Cardian Willow with Calligrapher]]") can treat other monsters as Level 2 for a Synchro Summon.
  The Pendulum Effect of "[[Dragodies, the Empowered Warrior]]" can be used to help "[[Flower Cardian Paulownia with Phoenix]]", "[[Flower Cardian Pine with Crane]]", and "[[Flower Cardian Zebra Grass with Moon]]" activate their last effects, and its Monster Effect can add any of the "Flower Cardian" monsters from your Deck to your hand.

  === Weaknesses ===
  While this deck has immense draw power and flows well with the average first hand, it has a number of flaws.
  * If the player doesn't draw "[[Super Koi Koi]]", "[[Flower Gathering]]", "[[Flower Cardian Pine]]", "[[Flower Cardian Cherry Blossom]]", or "[[Flower Cardian Cherry Blossom with Curtain]]", they cannot Summon any other Flower Cardian monsters.
  * Cards that prevent Special Summoning monsters, such as "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]" and "[[Vanity's Fiend]]", prevent this Deck from working.
  * If the opponent Tributes "[[Flower Cardian Lightflare]]" using something such as a "[[Kaiju]]" monster or "[[Share the Pain]]", it does not count as [[leaves the field|leaving the field]] by a card effect, and hence it cannot use its effect to Summon another "Flower Cardian" Synchro Monster.
  * Due to the playing style of this archetype, monsters other than "Flower Cardian" monsters ruin the consistency, slowing down the deck.

  == Trivia ==
  * All "Flower Cardians" are based on ''Kasu'' (1-point cards), ''Tane'' (10-point cards), or ''Hikari'' (20-point cards). There are no "Flower Cardians" based on ''Tanzaku'' (5-point cards).
  * There are no more than two "Flower Cardian" cards of each suit (even of suits that include ''Kasu'', ''Tane'', and ''Hikari'').
