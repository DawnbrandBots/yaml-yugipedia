  "'''Ice Barrier'''" ({{Ruby|氷|ひょう}}{{Ruby|結|けっ}}{{Ruby|界|かい}} ''Hyōkekkai'') is an [[archetype]] consisting of [[WATER]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] resembling, for the most part, famous concepts, figures, warriors, and mythological beings of different Asian cultures. Their team symbol resembles a hexagonal snowflake.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Ice Barrier" archetype focuses on summoning [[WATER]] [[Synchro Monster]]s for field control and board breaking; the Main Deck monsters either help summon the Synchros or act as floodgates.

  Before the support from the ''OCG'' sets [[Structure Deck: Ice Barrier of the Frozen Prison]] and ''[[Terminal World]]'', "Ice Barrier" was seen as a weak archetype, though it had powerful generic Synchros (namely "[[Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]" and "[[Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]") that were often splashed into other Decks.

  After the support from ''Terminal World'', the Deck now aims to Summon "[[Lancea, Ancestral Dragon of the Ice Mountain]]" to then summon the archetype's Main Deck floodgates, while summoning other boss monsters to help support "Lancea".

  ! Card
  ! Description
  |-
  | [[Lancea, Ancestral Dragon of the Ice Mountain]]
  | One of the Deck's most important cards. When an opponent Special Summons, it can Special Summon floodgates like "[[General Raiho of the Ice Barrier]]" (hard twice per turn). Also, when it leaves the field, it can Special Summon an "Ice Barrier" monster from the Extra Deck (treated as a [[Synchro Summon]]), accessing powerful removal tools like "[[Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]" and "[[Trishula, Zero Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]". Note that "Lancea" is not an "Ice Barrier" monster.
  |-
  | [[Revealer of the Ice Barrier]]<br />[[Hexa Spirit of the Ice Barrier]]<br />[[Mirror Mage of the Ice Barrier]]
  | The three main playmakers of the Deck:
  * "Revealer" can discard a card to Special Summon an "Ice Barrier" Tuner from the Deck, usually "Hexa Spirit". Also, it can be banished from the GY to pay for an "Ice Barrier" discard cost.
  * "Hexa Spirit" can send a level 3 or lower "Ice Barrier" monster to the GY, usually "Mirror Mage", then change its level to that monster's level.
  * "Mirror Mage", when sent to the GY, can search any "Ice Barrier" card from the Deck. On field, it can Tribute a monster to Summon up to 3 "[[Ice Barrier Token]]s", then raise its level by the number of summoned Tokens.
  |-
  | [[General Raiho of the Ice Barrier]]
  | One of the main targets to Special Summon with "Lancea", Raiho forces the opponent to discard a card to activate a monster effect, or the effect is negated.
  |-
  | [[Georgius, Swordman of the Ice Barrier]]
  | Can be Special Summoned if you control an "Ice Barrier" monster, and when Summoned, Special Summons an "Ice Barrier" monster from hand/GY. Also, if there is another "Ice Barrier" monster, the opponent cannot activate the effects of monsters in the GY, acting as another target for "Lancea".
  |-
  | [[Warlock of the Ice Barrier]]
  | Acts as an "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]" on field if you control another "Ice Barrier" monster. Acts as a third target for "Lancea" if "Raiho" and "Georgius" are not enough.
  |-
  | [[Speaker for the Ice Barriers]]
  | If you control an "Ice Barrier" monster, it can be Special Summoned from hand, and banished from GY to summon an "Ice Barrier Token".
  |- 
  | [[Medallion of the Ice Barrier]]
  | Searches for any "Ice Barrier" monster, and not hard once per turn.
  |-
  | [[Winds Over the Ice Barrier]]
  | Tributes any number of "Ice Barrier" monsters (e.g., Ice Barrier Tokens) to Summon that many "Ice Barrier" monsters from the Deck.
  |-
  | [[Freezing Chains of the Ice Barrier]]
  | Special Summons a level 4 or lower "Ice Barrier" monster when activated, and if you control 3 or more "Ice Barrier" monsters, protects them from monsters from the Extra Deck.
  |}

  The Deck benefits from a wide array of WATER Extra Deck monsters, such as "[[Coral Dragon]]", "[[Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys]]", "[[Adamancipator Risen - Dragite]]", "[[Bahamut Shark]]" (to summon "[[Toadally Awesome]]"), and "[[Icejade Gymir Aegirine]]". "[[Marincess Coral Anemone]]" in particular can Special Summon "Mirror Mage" once it's sent to the GY.

  === Tips ===
  * "[[Icejade Ran Aegirine]]" is a perfect addition for the Deck, since it can [[Synchro Summon]] "[[Lancea, Ancestral Dragon of the Ice Mountain]]" (or another Level 10 [[WATER]] [[Synchro Monster]]) by simply discarding another [[WATER]] monster to Summon itself and an "[[Icejade Token]]".
  * The one-card combo involving "[[Revealer of the Ice Barrier]]" to Summon "Lancea, Ancestral Dragon of the Ice Mountain" and "[[Adamancipator Risen - Dragite]]" Summons "Lancea" as its [[List of unofficial terms#5th Summon|5th Summon]], thus allowing the player to Summon and use "[[Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]" if the opponent uses "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]".
  * While "Revealer of the Ice Barrier" is often the Deck's starter, it can be quite useful to use "[[Hexa Spirit of the Ice Barrier]]" + either "[[Georgius, Swordman of the Ice Barrier]]" or "[[Speaker for the Ice Barriers]]" instead. This can result in the same combo as using only "Revealer", but does not lock the player into WATER monsters until "Mirror Mage" is used.
  ** When doing so, "Mirror Mage" can use itself and a Token to Synchro Summon "[[Coral Dragon]]" to the [[Extra Monster Zone]], allowing "Speaker" to banish itself to Summon another Token, and then Synchro Summon "[[Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys]]", drawing 1 card from "Coral Dragon" and 3 from "Archethys".
  * It is important to remember that "Lancea, Ancestral Dragon of the Ice Mountain" is ''not'' an "Ice Barrier" monster. As such, lockdown effects that require the player to control another "Ice Barrier" monster (such as "[[Warlock of the Ice Barrier]]") still require the player to Summon another "Ice Barrier" monster before being applied.
  * The Tokens Summoned by "Mirror Mage" are a great way to activate "[[Winds Over the Ice Barrier]]", trading them for several Main Deck "Ice Barrier" monsters. Among them, "[[Spellbreaker of the Ice Barrier]]" can be particularly useful, since its effect won't work if Summoned by "Lancea".

  === Sample combos ===
  Most "Ice Barrier" combos aim to Summon "[[Lancea, Ancestral Dragon of the Ice Mountain]]" and other powerful [[WATER]] monsters. One such method is the following:
  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Revealer of the Ice Barrier]]" + 1 card
  | end     = "[[Lancea, Ancestral Dragon of the Ice Mountain]]" + "[[Adamancipator Risen - Dragite]]"
  | steps   = 
  # Summon "[[Revealer of the Ice Barrier]]"
  # Activate "Revealer" by discarding a card to Summon "[[Hexa Spirit of the Ice Barrier]]"
  # Activate "Hexa" to send "[[Mirror Mage of the Ice Barrier]]" from the Deck to the GY
  # Activate "Mirror Mage" to add "[[Georgius, Swordman of the Ice Barrier]]"
  # Activate "Georgius" to Summon itself from the hand
  # Activate "Georgius" to Summon "Mirror Mage" from the GY
  # Synchro Summon "[[Lancea, Ancestral Dragon of the Ice Mountain]]" by using "Georgius" and "Revealer"
  # Activate "Mirror Mage" to [[Tribute]] "Hexa Spirit" to Summon 3 "[[Ice Barrier Token]]s" and increase its Level to 5
  # Synchro Summon "[[Adamancipator Risen - Dragite]]" by using "Mirror Mage" and the 3 "Ice Barrier Tokens"
  }}

  Another variant can use one of the archetype's extenders to build a much powerful board, allowing the player to draw 4 cards, and getting a negate on board as its 5th Summon, thus playing around "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]".
  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Revealer of the Ice Barrier]]" + 1 of either "[[Georgius, Swordman of the Ice Barrier]]" or "[[Speaker for the Ice Barriers]]" + 1 card
  | end     = "[[Lancea, Ancestral Dragon of the Ice Mountain]]" + "[[Toadally Awesome]]" + "[[Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys]]" + 4 draws
  | steps   = 
  # Summon "[[Revealer of the Ice Barrier]]"
  # Activate "Revealer" by discarding a card to Summon "[[Hexa Spirit of the Ice Barrier]]"
  # Activate "Hexa" to send "[[Mirror Mage of the Ice Barrier]]" from the Deck to the GY
  # Activate "Mirror Mage" to add either "[[Georgius, Swordman of the Ice Barrier]]" or "[[Speaker for the Ice Barriers]]" (whichever is not in the hand already)
  # Activate "Speaker" to Summon itself from the hand
  # Xyz Summon "[[Bahamut Shark]]" by using "Revealer" and "Speaker"
  # Activate "Bahamut Shark" to Summon "[[Toadally Awesome]]" from the Extra Deck
  # Link Summon "[[Marincess Coral Anemone]]" by using "Bahamut Shark" and "Hexa Spirit"
  # Activate "Coral Anemone" to Summon "Mirror Mage" from the GY to the zone it points to
  # Activate "Mirror Mage" to [[Tribute]] "Coral Anemone" to Summon 3 "[[Ice Barrier Token]]s" and increase its Level to 5
  # Synchro Summon "[[Coral Dragon]]" to the Extra Monster Zone by using "Mirror Mage" and 1 "Ice Barrier Token"
  # Activate "Georgius" to Summon itself from the hand
  # Activate "Georgius" to Summon "Revealer" from the GY
  # Synchro Summon "[[Lancea, Ancestral Dragon of the Ice Mountain]]" by using "Georgius" and "Revealer"
  # Activate "Speaker" from the GY to Summon another "Ice Barrier Token"
  # Synchro Summon "[[Ravenous Crocodragon Archethys]]" by using "Coral Dragon" and 3 "Ice Barrier Tokens"
  # Activate "Archetthys" and "Coral Dragon" to draw a total of 4 cards

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Unless the player has opened with multiple extenders, negating "[[Revealer of the Ice Barrier]]" or "[[Hexa Spirit of the Ice Barrier]]" can often end their turn on the spot.
  * Much of the Deck's field presence comes from "Lancea", so negating it with a card like "[[Infinite Impermanence]]" or "[[Forbidden Droplet]]" cuts most of the sting.
  ** The Deck has no archetypal Spells/Traps to negate cards. As such, "[[Dark Ruler No More]]" and "[[Forbidden Droplet]]" can often deal with an "Ice Barrier" board.
  * Since all of the Deck's removal options are on their [[Extra Deck]], locking them out of it with cards such as "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" or "[[Vanity's Fiend]]" can prevent the player from establishing their board.
  * "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" can be used if the player activates "[[Medallion of the Ice Barrier]]". This will prevent the search effect of "[[Mirror Mage of the Ice Barrier]]", and will most likely make their end board a lot weaker.
  * "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]" will prevent the player from Summoning more than 1 "Ice Barrier" monster.
