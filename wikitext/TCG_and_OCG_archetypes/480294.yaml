  "'''Gouki'''" is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[George Gore]], [[Kenchi]], and [[Yozaka]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]'' anime. They debuted in ''[[Code of the Duelist]]''.

  == Design ==
  [[File:Gouki (anime).png|200px|left|thumb|[[George Gore|The Gore]] with "[[Gouki The Great Ogre (anime)|Gouki The Great Ogre]]" and "[[Gouki Suprex (anime)|Suprex]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|anime]].]]

  === Appearance ===
  "Gouki" have wrestling themes in design and name, shown in the fact that they wear tights and golden championship belts. While each of the Main Deck monsters are based on an animal, the Extra Deck monsters are based on [[wikipedia:Ogre|Ogres]] which they draw heavy elements from. Their championship belts have the face of their themed animal, and their helmets fit the theme of their animal as well. They are also suited up in padded armor and wield weapons. They possess a predominantly single colored theme. So far, the Main Deck monsters each have a primary/secondary color while the Link Monsters are a neutral color. These monsters resemble, in terms of style, the "[[Elemental HERO]]es".

  === Etymology ===
  "Gouki" ({{Ruby|剛|ごう}}{{Ruby|鬼|き}}) means "strong oni", where an ''[[wikipedia:oni|oni]]'' is a type of Japanese ''[[wikipedia:Yōkai|yokai]]'' similar to ogres. The Main Deck "Gouki" monsters are named after wrestling moves, such as the [[wikipedia:Suplex|Suplex]], and then their appearance is based off an animal whose name is in the wrestling move name, being based off of their respective animal, or creates a pun based off that animal's name, that phonetically sounds in their romaji, such as "[[Gouki Suprex]]" being a pun on T-Rex (SupREX).

  == Playing style ==
  The "Gouki" monsters focus on a straightforward aggressive strategy, using effects to increase their [[ATK]]s or decrease the opponent's. The Main Deck monsters have 0 [[DEF]], being immune to the effect of "[[Gouki The Great Ogre]]", who, in turn, has no DEF; that makes it so that they generally have an advantage over the opponent's monsters' ATKs, since those will be reduced while their own won't.
  The Main Deck monsters are separated into two subgroups; those based on animals and those not. The animal-based monsters all have the effect "''If this card is sent from the field to the Graveyard: You can add 1 "Gouki" card from your Deck to your hand, except [itself]''", replacing themselves when used as Link and Synchro Materials, or used with cards like "[[Transmodify]]" and "[[Spiritual Earth Art - Kurogane]]". The others monsters have differing effects, but they still focus on card advantage.

  === Weaknesses ===
  While the "Gouki" focus on straightforward aggressive strategy, the Main Deck monsters have 0 DEF. Switching them to Defense Position using cards such as "[[No Entry!!]]", "[[Earthquake]]", and "[[Quaking Mirror Force]]" deals a severe blow to their strategy both by exposing their vulnerable DEF and preventing them from using their best effects, especially as "Quaking Mirror Force" prevents them from being used as Link Materials. "[[Blackwing - Jin the Rain Shadow]]" can be a problem for the Main Deck monsters due to its effect to destroy any monster whose DEF is lower than its ATK.
