  "'''M∀LICE'''" ({{Ruby|Ｍ∀ＬＩＣＥ|マリス}} ''Marisu'') is an archetype of [[DARK]] [[Cyberse]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Crossover Breakers]]''/''[[Crossover Breakers]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The name "M∀LICE" is derived from the word "malice", in reference to malicious software or [[wikipedia:malware|malware]], and the name "Alice", the protagonist of [[wikipedia:Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carroll]]'s most notable works: ''[[wikipedia:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass]]''.

  The upside-down A could be based on its usage as the mathematical symbol for an operation applying "for all" items in a set. In addition to referencing Carroll's work in mathematics and the use of math in computer code, it may be a visual pun on how the worlds the protagonist of the novels explore are metaphorical "upside-down worlds" where normal logic is suspended, and which are supposedly geographically-located underground or on the other side of a reflection.

  === Members ===
  The monsters resemble female humanoids, each themed after a character from one of Carroll's novels, with a sci-fi cyberspace aesthetic that evokes computer malware.
