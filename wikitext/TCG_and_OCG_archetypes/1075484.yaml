  "'''M∀LICE'''" ({{Ruby|Ｍ∀ＬＩＣＥ|マリス}} ''Marisu'') is an archetype of [[DARK]] [[Cyberse]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Crossover Breakers]]''/''[[Crossover Breakers]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The name "M∀LICE" is derived from the word "malice", in reference to malicious software or [[wikipedia:malware|malware]], and the name "Alice", the protagonist of [[wikipedia:Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carroll]]'s most notable works: ''[[wikipedia:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass]]''.

  The upside-down A could be based on its usage as the mathematical symbol for an operation applying "for all" items in a set. In addition to referencing Carroll's work in mathematics and the use of math in computer code, it may be a visual pun on how the worlds the protagonist of the novels explore are metaphorical "upside-down worlds" where normal logic is suspended, and which are supposedly geographically-located underground or on the other side of a reflection.

  === Members ===
  The monsters resemble female humanoids, each themed after a character from one of Carroll's novels, with a sci-fi cyberspace aesthetic that evokes computer malware.

  The related monster "[[Mad Hacker]]" is based on the [[wikipedia:Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]] and [[wikipedia:Hacker|hacking]], but does not reference playing cards or chess.

  The [[Trap Card]]s are named after acronyms based on phrases in specific chapters from ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "M∀LICE" relies heavily on [[banish]]ing cards to make their plays. Anti-banish floodgates such as "[[Artifact Lancea]]", "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" and "[[Chaos Hunter]]" can disable most of the main plays.
  * Cards that prevent Special Summoning, such as "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Vanity's Fiend]]" and "[[Vanity's Ruler]]" will also shut down "M∀LICE" decks.
  * "[[Soul Drain]]" will prevent "M∀LICE" monsters from returning themselves to the field after being banished.
  * Being an archetype of full Cyberse monsters, "[[There Can Be Only One]]" will restrict most of their plays.
  * "[[Kaiju]]" monsters, as well as "[[Lava Golem]]" and "[[The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode]]" can simply bypass the Link "M∀LICE" monsters and leave the opponent with no out.
  * Finally, given all the "M∀LICE" monsters are of DARK Attribute, they are weak to Anti-DARK floodgates such as "[[Consecrated Light]]" and "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]".

  == Trivia ==
  * The original reveal of the theme was published at 5:00 PM JST, which may be a reference to the time displayed by the White Rabbit's pocket watch in [[wikipedia:Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Disney's ''Alice in Wonderland'' movie adaptation]].
