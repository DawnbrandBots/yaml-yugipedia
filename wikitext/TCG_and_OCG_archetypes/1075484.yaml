  "'''Maliss'''", known as "'''M∀LICE'''" ({{Ruby|Ｍ∀ＬＩＣＥ|マリス}} ''Marisu'') in Japan, is an archetype of [[DARK]] [[Cyberse]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Crossover Breakers]]''/''[[Crossover Breakers]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Etymology ===
  The name "Maliss" is derived from the word "malice", in reference to malicious software or [[wikipedia:malware|malware]], and the name "Alice", the protagonist of [[wikipedia:Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carroll]]'s most notable works: ''[[wikipedia:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass]]''. The name "[[wikipedia:Alice and Bob|Alice]]" is also commonly used as a placeholder name in scenarios and discussions about cryptographic systems and protocols.

  In mathematical logic, the turned A (∀) symbol is used to indicate [[wikipedia:Universal quantification|universal quantification]] as a logical constant representing "for all" in a set. In addition to referencing Carroll's work in mathematics and the use of math in computer code, it may be a visual pun on how the worlds the protagonist of the novels explore are metaphorical "upside-down worlds" where normal logic is suspended, and which are supposedly geographically-located underground or on the other side of a reflection.

  === Members ===
  The monsters resemble female humanoids based on characters from Lewis Carroll's novels. Their designs have visual elements of digital technology and cyberspace in reference to the archetype's theme of malware.

  The designation of [[Main Deck]] monsters as [[wikipedia:Pawn (chess)|pawns]] and the [[Link Monster]]s as [[wikipedia:Queen (chess)|queens]] is based on the special rule of [[wikipedia:Promotion (chess)|promotion]] in the game of chess. This is a reference to ''Through the Looking-Glass'', where Alice takes the role of a pawn and is promoted to a queen.

  The related monster "[[Mad Hacker]]" is based on the character [[wikipedia:Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]] and the act of [[wikipedia:Hacker|hacking]].

  The [[Trap Card]]s are named after acronyms based on phrases in specific chapters from ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''.

  == Playing style ==
  The archetype is geared towards a Link Monster beatdown strategy, with the Pawns supporting the QUEENs with protections.

  Each main deck member of the archetype have effects that allow you to gain advantages by banishing another Maliss card from the hand, with the banished Maliss capable of summoning themselves back to the field at the cost of 300 Life Points each. The Link Monsters further this strategy by continuously banishing your and your opponents cards. 

  Other existing Cyberse cards that benefit from being banished include [[Dotscaper]], which can summon itself upon banish, and [[Balancer Lord]], who allows you to summon another card from your hand. Keep in mind that these two cards are not applicable targets for main deck Maliss cards' banish effect.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "Maliss" relies heavily on [[banish]]ing cards to make their plays. Anti-banish floodgates such as "[[Artifact Lancea]]", "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" and "[[Chaos Hunter]]" can disable most of the main plays.
  * Cards that prevent Special Summoning, such as "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Vanity's Fiend]]" and "[[Vanity's Ruler]]" will also shut down "Maliss" decks.
  * "[[Soul Drain]]" will prevent "Maliss" monsters from returning themselves to the field after being banished.
  * Being an archetype of full Cyberse monsters, "[[There Can Be Only One]]" will restrict most of their plays.
  * "[[Kaiju]]" monsters, as well as "[[Lava Golem]]" and "[[The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode]]" can simply bypass the Link "Maliss" monsters and leave the opponent with no out.
  * Finally, given all the "Maliss" monsters are of DARK Attribute, they are weak to Anti-DARK floodgates such as "[[Consecrated Light]]" and "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]".

  == Trivia ==
  * The original reveal of the theme was published at 5:00 PM JST, which may be a reference to the time displayed by the White Rabbit's pocket watch in [[wikipedia:Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Disney's ''Alice in Wonderland'' movie adaptation]].
