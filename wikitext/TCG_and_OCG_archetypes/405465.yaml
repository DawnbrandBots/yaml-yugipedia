  "'''Buster Blader'''" (バスター・ブレイダー ''Basutā Bureidā'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yugi Muto]] and [[Yami Yugi]], to counter the "[[Blue-Eyes]]" cards used by [[Seto Kaiba]]. The archetype is related to the "[[Destruction Sword]]" [[archetype]].
  ==Lore==
  {{Main|Destruction Sword#Lore}}
  ==Playing style==
  When [[Normal Summon]]ed, "[[Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman]]" can search for a "Destruction Sword" card. An ideal opening move is to search for "[[Destruction Sword Memories]]" or "[[Destruction Swordsman Fusion]]" to get either "[[Buster Blader]]" or "[[Buster Blader, the Destruction Swordmaster]]" to the field. In the same turn, "Buster Whelp" can either [[Tribute]] itself to Special Summon a "Buster Blader" from the hand or Graveyard or Special Summon itself from the Graveyard by discarding a "Destruction Sword" card. 
  Besides the useful Disruption effects of "[[Dragon Buster Destruction Sword]]" and "[[Wizard Buster Destruction Sword]]", "Dragon Buster" can Special Summon itself to the Field to [[Synchro Summon]] "[[Buster Dragon]]" and "Wizard Buster" can send itself to the Graveyard to add a different "Destruction Sword" card back to the hand.
  As a Level 1 Tuner monster, "Buster Whelp" can be searched by the effect of "[[Sage with Eyes of Blue]]", and, as it has a once per turn effect, extras can be discarded with "[[Cards of Consonance]]" to use its second effect in combination with "[[Buster Dragon]]". The evolved forms of "Buster Whelp", "Dragon Buster", "Robot Buster", and "Wizard Buster" can be equipped to a "Buster Blader" to disrupt the opponent in various ways.
  "[[Emblem of Dragon Destroyer]]" adds the original "Buster Blader" from the Deck, but can only add "Buster Blader, the Destruction Swordmaster" from the Graveyard (due to it being treated as "Buster Blader" in the Graveyard).
  "[[Magical Hats]]" can send the "Destruction Sword" Spell/Trap Cards the Graveyard, so that the Spells can recycle themselves or the Traps can activate their secondary effects. "[[Dragon Ravine]]" can send "[[Dragunity Phalanx]]" (in combination with the "[[Dragunity]]" archetype) or "Buster Whelp" directly to the Graveyard.
  The Pendulum effect of "[[Dragoncaller Magician]]" allows any monster on the field to be treated as a [[Dragon]], which not only assists the original "Buster Blader", but allows "Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman" to use its effects without "Buster Dragon" or "DNA Surgery". Additionally, it can be combined with "[[Dragonpit Magician]]" for actual Pendulum Summoning and Spell/Trap destruction.
  "[[Dragon's Mirror]]" can also be included as a last resort, because if all else fails, it can be used to Summon "[[Five-Headed Dragon]]" or "[[First of the Dragons]]" for the finishing blow, because your opponent will have likely already exhausted most of their resources to deal with "[[Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman]]", "[[Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon]]", and especially "[[Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons]]" and "[[Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon]]".

  === Hieratic [[Destruction Sword]]/Buster Blader ===
  A new variant that emerged in 2016, following the release of ''[[Breakers of Shadow]]'', which combines [[Hieratic]] monsters with the [[Destruction Sword]] cards used to support [[Buster Blader]]. This variant takes advantage of the fact that "[[Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman]]" can be Fusion Summoned by fusing "[[Buster Blader]]" with ANY Dragon monster, and uses Hieratic Dragons as an engine to Special Summon "[[Buster Dragon]]" (through "[[Ultimaya Tzolkin]]") and "Dragon Destroyer". This variant can be very powerful if using cards such as "[[Foolish Burial]]" "[[Vice Dragon]]" and "[[Lightpulsar Dragon]]", as well as "[[Dragon Shrine]]", "[[One for One]]", "[[Jet Synchron]]", "[[Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal]]" and other cards that allow you to send cards from your hand or Deck to the Graveyard.
  "[[Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal]]" is one of this Deck's most critical cards, as she can be summoned easily with Tefnuit, Su and Wattaildragon, and helps you mill Graveyard-oriented Destruction Sword cards.
  Because this Deck runs a lot of Level 1 Tuner monsters, it is advisable to add "[[Number 39: Utopia Roots]]" to support them in a pinch. This further cements "Jet Synchron's" place in the Deck, as if Jet Synchron is used as an Xyz Material after being Summoned with his own effect, not for a Synchro Summon, he will go back to the Graveyard to be reused once being detached.
  Due to the excess of [[DARK]] Destruction Sword cards, [[Chaos]] monsters such as "[[Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning]]" might a helpful option. "[[Galaxy Soldier]]" can also be useful due to all the [[LIGHT]] monsters, alloying to Xyz Summon monsters such as "[[Constellar Pleiades]]" and "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]" through "[[Cyber Dragon Nova|Nova]]". With less requires Set up, "[[Chain Summon]]" can be used, targeting "Atum", to Special Summon "Cyber Dragon Nova" and immediately evolve it into "Infinity"
