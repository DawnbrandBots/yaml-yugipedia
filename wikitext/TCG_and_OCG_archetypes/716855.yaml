  "'''Starry Knight'''", known as "'''Holy Nights'''" (ホーリーナイツ ''Hōrī Naitsu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fairy]] monsters introduced in ''[[Selection 10]]''. It was released as support for "[[Seiyaryu]]", along with its [[retrained]] [[counterpart]] "[[Starry Night, Starry Dragon]]".
  ==Design==
  The archetype is based on the [[wikipedia:Christmas|Christmas]] holiday, with the archetype name being a pun on how the Japanese name of "[[Seiyaryu]]" translates to "Holy Knight Dragon", acting also as a reference to the song ''[[wikipedia:Silent Night|Silent Night]]''. The monsters seem to be based on angels which are often featured in portrayals of the holiday. The [[Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s include more references to the holiday such as [[wikipedia:Advent|Advent]] period before Christmas ("[[Starry Knight Arrival]]") and [[wikipedia:Nativity|Nativity]] plays ("[[Starry Knight Ceremony]]").
  As "Seiyaryu" is the [[LIGHT]] [[counterpart]] of "[[Serpent Night Dragon]]", the monsters have some bonus effects against [[DARK]] monsters.
  The total original [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] of all the [[Level]] 4 monsters equals 2500, likely reflecting the original ATK of "[[Seiyaryu]]", and Christmas being the 25th of December.

  ==Etymology==
  The individual names of the "Starry Knight" monsters are [[wikipedia:Theophory in the Bible|Theophoric]], ending in 'el' to mimic the names of Abrahamic angels.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|Master Duel card storylines#Legend of the Starry Dragon}}

  ==Playing style==
  "Starry Knight" are based around summoning Level 7 [[LIGHT]] [[Dragon]] monsters from the hand and then supporting them. Their main boss monster, "[[Starry Night, Starry Dragon]]", can target a card to destroy it every time that its summoned from the hand, while both "[[Starry Knight Flamel|Flamel]]" and "[[Starry Knight Arrival|Arrival]]" have effects that can return copies to the hand so that you can summon them again.
  As "[[Arkbrave Dragon]]" is also a Level 7 monster, one possible way to build this Deck would be incorporating parts of the "[[Felgrand]]" series into this Deck. Although their Graveyard focused strategy may clash with [[Starry Night, Starry Dragon]] only destroying when its summoned from the hand.
