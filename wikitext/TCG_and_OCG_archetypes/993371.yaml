  {{Quote|"In this world, there is a massive crystal embedded in the center of a great mountain range. An entire crystal domain extends forth from it in every direction, changing everything that's touched by it into the same type of crystal. The crystal rot doesn't just affect the environment either. It spreads to animals and other lifeforms within the domain of the great crystal, transforming them into an entire new being.

  Is it a natural disaster or something else? Whatever it is, the creatures it's altered continue to roam free. The rot continues to spread, and something else seems to be forming within the domain as well. At the center of it all lies something that has become known as the Crystal God Tistina, and all who gaze upon its form marvel at its beauty and experience true fear."|source=Yu-Gi-Oh!

  "'''Tistina'''" (ティスティナ ''Tisutina'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Aqua]] monsters of various different [[Attribute]]s and [[Level]]s introduced in ''[[Duelist Nexus]]''.

  ==Design==
  === Etymology ===
  The name "Tistina" comes from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptistina_family Baptistina family of asteroids], one such asteroid speculated to have been the asteroid that caused the mass extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs on Earth. It could also likely come from a shortening of the Italian adjective "ametistina", derived from "[[wiktionary:amethyst|amethyst]]", befitting the crystal theme; alternatively, it could be a corruption of "amethyst" spelled backwards.

  === Appearance ===
  The "Tistina" monsters carry a shared theme of crystalized organisms of different shapes and forms, with some resembling living creatures. "[[Crystal God Tistina]]" itself shares some significant traits with the Lovecraft extended mythos god Q'yth-az, namely "frost-like" qualities (alluded to by the theme's Aqua typing) and transforming living beings (such as "Hound" and "Sentinel") into crystals.

  ==Playing style==
  "Tistina" is a theme focused on controlling the board state through the effects of its [[Level]] 10 boss monsters; "[[Crystal God Tistina]]" and "[[Demigod of the Tistina]]". Both monsters are able to change as many monsters the opponent controls as possible to [[Face-down|face-down]] [[Defense Position]], followed by sending all remaining [[Face-up|face-up]] cards they control to the [[Graveyard|GY]]; a powerful effect that is able to remove any [[Link Monster]] or face-up [[Spell Card|Spell]] or [[Trap Card|Trap]] card the opponent controls upon resolution. This is supported by the lower-Level monsters of the theme, "[[Sentinel of the Tistina]]" and "[[Hound of the Tistina]]", with "Sentinel" being able to search "Tistina" cards and "Hound" allowing "Tistina" monsters to [[Direct attack|directly attack]] the opponent while they control a face-down Defense Position monster. Both "Sentinel" and "Hound" also share an effect to [[Special Summon]] themselves from the hand or GY if you control a [[LIGHT]] "Tistina" monster, allowing for easy and continuous access to the smaller monsters to utilize their effects or use them as materials to make stronger monsters.

  While "Demigod" has an effect to Special Summon itself from the hand, the primary way to Special Summon "Crystal God Tistina" is through the effect of their [[Field Spell Card|Field Spell]]; "[[Divine Domain Baatistina]]". This card is able to [[Send|send]] 1 "Tistina" monster from the Deck to the GY, then if the opponent controls 3 or more face-up cards, the player can Special Summon "Crystal God Tistina" from the hand or Deck. "Baatistina" is also capable of Special Summoning any "Tistina" monster from the Deck or GY if destroyed while in the [[Field Zone]] by the opponent's card effect. Alongside "Baatistina" is the powerful Spell Card "[[Breath of the Tistina]]", a [[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous Spell]] that grants an additional [[Normal Summon]] of a "Tistina" monster once per turn and is able to add 1 "Tistina" card from Deck to hand by targeting and changing a face-up monster to face-down position, this effect allowing for the the target to be an opponent's monster if the player controls a LIGHT "Tistina" monster.

  Through this, the playing style of "Tistina" as a theme is using the powerful effects of both "Demigod" and "Crystal God" to lock down the opponent's monsters and use "Hound" as a means of inflicting damage through the set monsters. Barring this, the impressive recursion of the lower Level monsters and the easy summoning condition of "Demigod" allows the theme to access various monsters from the [[Extra Deck]]; from powerful [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] and [[Link Monster|Link]] monsters to even a variety of [[Rank 10 Monster Cards|Rank 10]] [[Xyz Monster]]s. As well, the theme is easily able to be splashed with several different engines and archetypes able to add further consistency to the Deck; such as the "[[Diabellstar]]" engine to give an example.
