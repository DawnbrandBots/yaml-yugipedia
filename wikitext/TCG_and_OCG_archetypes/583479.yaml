  ==Playing style==
  "Witchcrafter" monsters are packed with two effects, with one of them being a [[Quick Effect]] that requires the player to [[discard]] a [[Spell Card]] to be activated. This effect of the lower-[[Level]] "Witchcrafter" monsters are all used to [[Special Summon]] another "Witchcrafter" monster from the [[Deck]], in which case it can only be activated during the [[Main Phase]], and as additional [[cost]], the monsters also need to be [[Tribute]]d. Meanwhile, this effect of the higher-Level monsters are various, ranged from Special Summoning another "Witchcrafter" from the [[hand]], to [[destroy]]ing a [[face-up]] card, to [[negating]] the effects of all face-up monsters the opponent controls.

  "[[Witchcrafter Golem Aruru]]" has an effect to [[target]] a card the opponent controls or a "Witchcrafter" Spell in the player's [[GY]], and [[return]] the target to the hand, thus making it a rather unique member, because it can recover a Spell instead of discarding them. This effect can be triggered when a [[Spellcaster]] monster is targeted by an attack or card effect while "Aruru" is in the hand, making "Aruru" some sort of a [[hand trap]].

  As for the other effect, the low-Level "Witchcrafter" monsters all have the same cost to use it, that is by [[banish]]ing themselves from the GY, which results in different effects. The high-Level ones, however, have more unique effects to use with different kind costs.

  Despite a lot of discarding cost for their effects, a "Witchcrafter" Deck can still cover these losses, since their exclusive Spells can return themselves from the GY to the hand during the player's [[End Phase]], as long as the player controls a "Witchcrafter" monster.

  Depending on the situation, "Witchcrafter" players usually have two options in utilizing their Spells during a turn; either activating them to [[search]], Special Summon, or backup the "Witchcrafter" monsters, or to discard them as ammunition for the monsters instead (in which case the Spells will return to the hand when that turn is over). Even if the player runs out of Spells in their hand to activate "Witchcrafter" [[monster effect]]s, both of their [[Continuous Spell]]s - "[[Witchcrafter Scroll]]" and "[[Witchcrafter Bystreet]]" - can be sent them from the [[field]] to the GY as the cost replacement, instead of discarding them, and they can still be returned face-up to the field from the GY during the player's next End Phase.

  Their Traps Cards, on the other hand, are used to salvage the used cards or even search for more cards; both also deal with banishment. "[[Witchcrafter Patronus]]" is useful to recycle the banished low-Level "Witchcarfter" monsters (due to their own effects in the GY), or the banished Spells due to the second effect of the other Trap, "[[Witchcrafter Masterpiece]]", to Special Summon a "Witchcrafter" monster from the Deck. 

  Overall, the strategy of "Witchcrafter" is that of grind and control which involve bringing out their higher-Level monsters that can disrupt the opponent's plays. Due to the constant recursion effect of their Spells and "[[Witchcrafter Patronus]]" combo with "[[Spell Chronicle]]", the Deck is capable of slowly out resourcing the opponent by constantly [[add]]ing Spell Cards to the hand to fuel their effects.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * As "Witchcrafter" Decks is reliant on recovering resource from the Graveyard, anti-Graveyard floodgates such as "[[Necrovalley]]", "[[Dimension Shifter]]", or "[[Macro Cosmos]]" can prevent them from generating any advantage.
