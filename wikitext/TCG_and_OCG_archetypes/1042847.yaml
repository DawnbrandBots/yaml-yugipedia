  "'''Exodd'''" is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s introduced in ''Millennium Box Gold Edition'' (''Legendary Decks II'' in the ''[[TCG]]''). It is directly supported by the "[[Exodia]]" archetype and related to the "[[Forbidden One]]" and "[[Millennium]]"/"[[Sennen]]" ones.

  In the ''OCG'', the original "[[Obliterate!!!]]" card is a member of this archetype. To account for this, the ''TCG'' treats "Obliterate!!!" as a different archetype also supported by the same cards, avoiding any mechanical difference between the two formats.

  ==Design==
  These cards derive from the [[signature move]]s of the completed "[[Exodia the Forbidden One]]". In Japanese, three distinct names were used for Exodia's attack names in the manga; in English, all of them are typically localized as simply "Obliterate".

  ==Playing style==
  "Exodd" cards serve as a supplement to "Exodia" decks by using "Forbidden One" cards as resources to maintain a favorable playstate, as an alternative to (or a stepping stone in) executing strategies dependent on the deck's alternative win condition (e.g. [[Exodia OTK]]). "Exodia" decks otherwise suffer from being highly draw-power dependent and necessarily including weak individual monsters. "Exodd" cards assist by buying time through disruption, setting up Level 10+ "Exodia" monsters to function as beat-sticks, and moving needed pieces for the alternative win condition to locations that are potentially more accessible.
