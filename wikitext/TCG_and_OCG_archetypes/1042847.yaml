  "'''Exodd'''" (エグゾード Eguzōdo) is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s introduced in ''Millennium Box Gold Edition'' (''Legendary Decks II'' in the ''[[TCG]]''). It is directly supported by the "[[Exodia]]" archetype and related to the "[[Forbidden One]]" and "[[Millennium]]" ones.

  In the ''OCG'', the original "[[Obliterate!!!]]" card is a member of this archetype. To account for this, the ''TCG'' treats "'''Obliterate!!!'''" as a different archetype also supported by the same cards, avoiding any mechanical difference between the two formats. It should also be noted that the "Exodd" archetype is utterly superfluous in the TCG, given how "Exxod - Fires of Rage" (the only "Exodd" card in the TCG currently, and not even one by direct name but by archetype condition) treats itself as as an "Obliterate!!!" card anyways, meaning "Exodd" can be completely written out of TCG card text and it would change nothing.

  ==Design==
  These cards derive from the [[signature move]]s of the completed "[[Exodia the Forbidden One]]". In Japanese, three distinct names were used for Exodia's attack names in the manga; in English, all of them are typically localized as simply "Obliterate".

  ==Playing style==
  "Exodd" cards serve as a supplement to "Exodia" decks by using "Forbidden One" cards as resources to maintain a favorable playstate, as an alternative to (or a stepping stone in) executing strategies dependent on the deck's alternative win condition (e.g. [[Exodia OTK]]). "Exodia" decks otherwise suffer from being highly draw-power dependent and necessarily including weak individual monsters. "Exodd" cards assist by buying time through disruption, setting up Level 10+ "Exodia" monsters to function as beat-sticks, and moving needed pieces for the alternative win condition to locations that are potentially more accessible.
