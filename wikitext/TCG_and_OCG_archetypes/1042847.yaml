  "'''Exodd'''" and "'''Obliterate!!!'''" is an [[archetype]] (OCG), two archetypes (TCG) of [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s introduced in ''Millennium Box Gold Edition'' (''Legendary Decks II'' in the ''[[TCG]]''). It is directly supported by the "[[Exodia]]" archetype (as of ''The Infinite Forbidden'') and related to the "[[Forbidden One]]", "[[Millennium]]" and "[[Sennen]]" archetypes.

  In the ''OCG'', "[[Obliterate!!!]]" is a member of the '''Exodd''' archetype, known as '''Exodo''' (エグゾード, ''Eguzōdo'') in the Japanese version. In the ''TCG'', while "Exodd" and "Obliterate!!!" are technically two different archetypes, all cards that support the two archetypes simultaneously support both, meaning that there is no mechanical difference between the ''TCG'' and the ''OCG''.

  ==Design==
  These cards derive from the [[signature move]]s of the completed "[[Exodia the Forbidden One]]". In Japanese, three distinct names were used for Exodia's attack names in the manga; in English, all of them are typically localized as simply "Obliterate".

  ==Playing style==
  "Exodd" cards serve as a supplement to "Exodia" decks by using "Forbidden One" cards as resources to maintain a favorable playstate, as an alternative to (or a stepping stone in) executing strategies dependent on the deck's alternative win condition (e.g. [[Exodia OTK]]). "Exodia" decks otherwise suffer from being highly draw-power dependent and necessarily including weak individual monsters. "Exodd" cards assist by buying time through disruption, setting up Level 10+ "Exodia" monsters to function as beat-sticks, and moving needed pieces for the alternative win condition to locations that are potentially more accessible.
