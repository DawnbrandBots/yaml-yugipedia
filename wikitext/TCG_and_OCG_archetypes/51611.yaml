  "'''Silent Magician'''" (サイレント・マジシャン ''Sairento Majishan'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Spellcaster]] "[[LV]]" [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yugi Muto]].

  In the anime and manga, the entire theme is represented by the single card "[[Silent Magician LV0]]" (or just "[[Silent Magician (manga)|Silent Magician]]" in the manga), which gained 500 ATK for every card the opponent drew, and 'aged up' in appearance accordingly.

  In the ''[[TCG]]''/''[[OCG]]'', "[[Silent Magician LV4]]" and "[[Silent Magician LV8]]" were released as the original members, with the former being a direct adaptation of the original and the latter based on the highest [[Level (stat boost)|level]] it reached ([[Silent Magician LV5|which was actually 5]]). "[[Silent Magician]]" and "[[Silent Magician Zero]]" were made later as [[retrain]]s.
