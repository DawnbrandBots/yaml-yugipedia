  "'''Arcana Force'''" (アルカナフォース ''Arukana Fōsu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fairy]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with equal [[original ATK and DEF]] used by [[Sartorius]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. The monsters are based on the [[wikipedia:Major Arcana|Major Arcana]] [[wikipedia:tarot|tarot]] cards, each possessing a different [[wikipedia:Tarot#Occult tarot decks|symbolic meaning]]. "[[Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler]]", "[[Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler]]", and "[[Arcana Force EX - The Chaos Ruler]]" are the only "Arcana Force" monsters not based on tarot cards.

  Every "Arcana Force" monster has two possible effects, one positive and one negative. When an "Arcana Force" monster is Summoned, its [[Trigger Effect]] activates, [[coin toss|tossing a coin]] to determine which of its two effects it gains, which it keeps as long as it remains face-up on the field; heads results in its positive effect whereas tails results in its negative effect. However, while they do have two possible effects based on the result of a coin toss, "Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler", "Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler", and "Arcana Force EX - The Chaos Ruler" have two positive effects rather than one positive and one negative. The Deck has a number of support cards to help ensure "Arcana Force" monsters have their heads effect.

  In the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' anime and some video games, the coin flip is represented by the card spinning until the opponent chooses to stop it, with the effect depending on whether the card is right-side-up or upside-down. [[The Light of Destruction]] which possesses Sartorius manipulates destiny to consistently give him the positive card effect. It uses this ability and the fact that the opponent chooses when to stop the card's spinning to manipulate people during Duels, demonstrating their belief that they control their own destinies is false, but Sartorius has [[Future Sight|seen their future]] and they can change their destiny if they ally with him.

  In the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'', "[[Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler]]" was the first "Arcana Force" card to be released. ''[[Light of Destruction]]'' debuted "Arcana Force" as an archetype, introducing a number of monsters and support cards. Several "Arcana Force" monsters and Sartorius's other cards that have appeared in the anime but not the ''OCG''/''TCG'' are included in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2]]'' as game original cards.

  == Origin ==
  With the exception of "[[Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler]]", "[[Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler]]", and "[[Arcana Force EX - The Chaos Ruler]]", the monsters are based on the [[wikipedia:Major Arcana|Major Arcana]] [[wikipedia:tarot|tarot]] cards, each possessing a different [[wikipedia:Tarot#Occult tarot decks|symbolic meaning]]. Sartorius also uses a number of Spell and Trap Cards which are based on [[wikipedia:Minor Arcana|Minor Arcana]] tarot cards, although "[[Reversal of Fate]]" is the only tarot-based Spell/Trap Card to be related to the "Arcana Force" archetype.

  Every tarot-based "Arcana Force" monster has a number in its name that matches the number of its corresponding tarot card, expressed in [[wikipedia:Roman numerals|Roman numerals]], although "[[Arcana Force 0 - The Fool]]" uses the [[wikipedia:Arabic numerals|Arabic numeral]] for zero instead due to zero not having a representation in Roman numerals. In the ''OCG'', these Roman numerals are in a different [[wikipedia:Typeface|typeface]] to [[wikipedia:Basic Latin (Unicode block)|basic Latin characters]], being the only card names in the ''OCG'' to use this typename; in the ''TCG'', standard Latin letters are used. All numbered "Arcana Force" monsters except "[[Arcana Force 0 - The Fool]]" have an [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] equal to their number × 100 + 1000; "[[Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler]]" and "[[Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler]]", which are unnumbered, instead have 4000 ATK and DEF.

  == Playing style ==
  To set up combos effectively, it’s essential for this Deck to access the Field Spell "[[Light Barrier]]" to bypass the coin toss requirement for "Arcana Force" monsters when they are Summoned, allowing the player to choose the effect to resolve. However, the Field Spell itself requires tossing a coin during each of the player's Standby Phase and gain the Heads effect in order to keep its effects activated. While it’s possible to play without "Light Barrier," doing so minimizes disruptions unless the player is exceptionally lucky with coin tosses and the opponent has no counter plays.

  For modern playing style, this Deck is designed to bring out "The Chaos Ruler" on the first turn using "[[Arcana Force V - The Hierophant]]" and "[[Arcana Force XIX - The Sun]]", and ideally, "Light Barrier" in the starting hand. Summoning "The Hierophant" allows the player to Special Summon 1 "Arcana Force" monster directly from the Deck—to your field if the coin toss result is Heads, or to your opponent's if it’s Tails. Then, "The Sun" can be Special Summoned from the hand if a card that has a coin tossing effect is on the field. This resulted in three "Arcana Force" monsters on the field. "The Chaos Ruler" must be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck by sending 3 "Arcana Force" monsters with different names from ''either'' field to the GY, which means, this goal can still be achieved regardless of "The Hierophant's" coin-toss result.

  "The Chaos Ruler", like other "Arcana Force EX" monsters, has positive effects on both coin-toss results. The Heads effect allows the player to Special Summon a Level 10 "Arcana Force" monsters (currently either "[[Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler|The Light Ruler]]" or "[[Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler|The Dark Ruler]]") from the hand or Deck, ignoring the Summoning conditions, enabling the player to instantly control two powerful monsters. The Tails effect can also come in handy as it allows the player to search any card with coin-tossing effect from the Deck. Additionally, "The Chaos Ruler" has a continuous effect that prevents the opponent to activate monster effects while "Light Barrier" is in the Field Zone.

  The Spells supporting this archetype also feature coin-tossing effects with different outcomes based on the result. These cards do not gain direct benefit from the effect of "Light Barrier", but even if the Field Spell's effects are negated, through its presence in the Field Zone alone, these Spells still allow the player to  to choose the desired effect. The first example is "[[Arcana Reading]]", a powerful card that tutors any card with a coin-tossing effect from your Deck if the coin toss result is Heads, or gives the opponent any card from their Deck if the result is Tails. Without "Light Barrier," the Tails result can be too risky in most cases. "[[Arcana Spread]]," however, has effects where both coin toss results are beneficial but situational: on Heads, it Special Summons a Level 4 or lower "Arcana Force" monster from the Deck, while on Tails, it Special Summons any monster with a coin-tossing effect from the player’s GY. This, too, can be controlled with "Light Barrier" in the Field Zone.

  Finally, the Continuous Spell "[[Light Force]]" is considered the most important starter in the deck. This card behaves similarly to "Light Barrier", that it will always start with its effects activated up until the next Standby Phase, where the player needs to toss a coin and gains the Heads effect to keep the effects up. The Spell gives small boost of 300 ATK/DEF to the player's Fairy monster, but its true strength lies in allowing the player to search 2 "Arcana Force" monsters with different names by discarding 1 card (though it restricts Special Summoning to "Arcana Force" monsters only afterward). With this effect, the player can search both "The Hierophant" and "The Sun" to execute "The Chaos Ruler" combo. The coin-tossing requirement of this card during the Standby Phase can also be skipped if the player controls "Light Barrier".

  For these reasons, this Deck heavily relies on "Light Barrier" to function optimally, making it essential to access it as quickly as possible. Therefore, cards like "Terraforming" is highly recommended. "[[Arcana Force XV - The Fiend]]" can also act as the archetype's field searcher. In the absence of any direct way to tutor "Light Barrier", the effect of "Light Force" can be used to search for "The Fiend".
