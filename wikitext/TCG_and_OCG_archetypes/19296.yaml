  "'''Arcana Force'''" (アルカナフォース ''Arukana Fōsu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fairy]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with equal [[original ATK and DEF]] used by [[Sartorius]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, and introduced to the ''OCG''/''TCG'' in ''[[Light of Destruction]]''.

  Every "Arcana Force" monster has an on Summon effect to flip a coin, with different effects if heads (positive) or tails (often negative). In the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' anime and some video games, this is represented by the card spinning until the opponent chooses to stop it, with the effect depending on whether the card is right-side-up or upside-down.

  == Origin ==
  With the exception of "[[Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler]]", "[[Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler]]", and "[[Arcana Force EX - The Chaos Ruler]]", the monsters are based on the [[wikipedia:Major Arcana|Major Arcana]] [[wikipedia:tarot|tarot]] cards, each possessing a different [[wikipedia:Tarot#Occult tarot decks|symbolic meaning]]. Sartorius also uses a number of Spell and Trap Cards which are based on [[wikipedia:Minor Arcana|Minor Arcana]] tarot cards, although "[[Reversal of Fate]]" is the only tarot-based Spell/Trap Card to be related to the "Arcana Force" archetype.

  Every tarot-based "Arcana Force" monster has a number in its name that matches the number of its corresponding tarot card, expressed in [[wikipedia:Roman numerals|Roman numerals]], although "[[Arcana Force 0 - The Fool]]" uses the [[wikipedia:Arabic numerals|Arabic numeral]] for zero instead due to zero not having a representation in Roman numerals. In the ''OCG'', these Roman numerals are in a different [[wikipedia:Typeface|typeface]] to [[wikipedia:Basic Latin (Unicode block)|basic Latin characters]], being the only card names in the ''OCG'' to use this typename; in the ''TCG'', standard Latin letters are used. All numbered "Arcana Force" monsters except "[[Arcana Force 0 - The Fool]]" have an [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] equal to their number × 100 + 1000; "[[Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler]]" and "[[Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler]]", which are unnumbered, instead have 4000 ATK and DEF.

  == Playing style ==
  "Arcana Force" is an archetype tied around coin tosses. To set up plays effectively, "[[Light Barrier]]" - which lets the player ignore the coin toss - is practically essential. However, "Light Barrier" itself requires a coin toss each turn to maintain its effect (excluding the turn it was activated). While the reliance on coin flips and awful "backfire" effects made it a very weak archetype for many years, modern support released in ''[[Supreme Darkness]]'' has greatly increased the power and consistency of the Deck.

  The modern playstyle is combo-centric, designed to use the heads effect of "[[Arcana Force XXI - The World]]" to essentially [[FTK]] the opponent, and/or bring out "The Chaos Ruler" on the first turn as a potent floodgate.

  === Monsters ===
  The main playmakers of the Deck are:

  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Arcana Force
  ! Non-Coin Effect
  ! Coin Toss Effect
  |-
  | [[Arcana Force V - The Hierophant|V - The Hierophant]]
  | Discards itself from hand;<br>The opponent cannot activate effects when an "Arcana Force" monster is summoned.
  | 
  * Heads: Summons a Level 4 or lower "Arcana Force" from Deck.
  * Tails: Summons an "Arcana Force" from Deck to the opponent's field.
  |-
  | [[Arcana Force XV - The Fiend|XV - The Fiend]]
  | Discards itself from hand to search "Light Barrier".
  | 
  * Heads: If an attack is declared involving this card, destroys a targeted monster.
  * Tails: If an attack is declared involving this card, destroys all monsters.
  |-
  | [[Arcana Force XIX - The Sun|XIX - The Sun]]
  | Special Summons itself from hand if the player controls a card with a coin toss effect.
  | 
  * Heads: Sets a coin toss Spell from Deck.
  * Tails: Destroys all cards in Spell/Trap zones.
  |-
  | [[Arcana Force XXI - The World|XXI - The World]]
  | None.
  |
  * Heads: Can send 2 monsters to the Graveyard to skip the opponent's turn.
  * Tails: Adds the top card of the opponent's GY to their hand.
  |-
  | [[Arcana Force EX - The Chaos Ruler|EX - The Chaos Ruler]]
  | Must be [[Contact Fusion|Contact Fused]] by sending 3 "Arcana Force" monsters from either field to GY.<br>If "Light Barrier" is on field, prevents the opponent from activating monster effects on field.
  |
  * Heads: Summons a Level 10 "Arcana Force" from Deck (ignoring conditions).
  * Tails: Sets a Spell/Trap from Deck with a coin tossing effect.
  |}

  Other monsters can be run as targets to Summon with "Hierophant" and "Chaos Ruler". For Chaos Ruler, the two possible targets are "[[Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler]]" and "[[Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler]]". "Dark Ruler" is preferred as its heads effect can help get extra damage.

  === Spells ===
  While "Light Barrier" does not directly support the Spells, each in-theme Spell lets you choose which coin effect to apply if "Light Barrier" is on the field. Most in-theme cards that search Spells search "spells that have a coin tossing effect" instead of an archetype name.

  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Card
  ! Non-Coin Effect
  ! Coin Toss Effect
  |-
  | [[Light Barrier]]
  | Allows the player to choose the coin effects of "Arcana Force" monsters.
  | During the Standby Phase: negates itself on Tails.
  |-
  | [[Light Force]]
  | Discards 1 card to add 2 different "Arcana Force" monsters from Deck to hand.<br>Also boosts the ATK/DEF of Fairy monsters by 300.
  | During the Standby Phase: negates itself on Tails.
  |- 
  | [[Arcana Reading]]
  | Banishes itself from the GY to Normal Summon an "Arcana Force" monster.
  | 
  * Heads: Adds a card with a coin tossing effect from Deck to hand.
  * Tails: Your opponent adds a card from Deck to hand.
  |- 
  | [[Arcana Spread]]
  | Banishes itself from the GY to add a coin tossing card from GY to hand.
  | 
  * Heads: Summons a Level 4 or lower "Arcana Force" from Deck.
  * Tails: Summons a coin tossing monster from GY.
  |}

  Cards that search "Light Barrier", such as "[[Terraforming]]", are recommended. "[[Arcana Force XV - The Fiend]]" is the in-archetype searcher; if needed, "Light Force" can search "The Fiend".

  ===Sample combos===
  One combo available to this archetype allows the player to skip the opponent's turn by using the effect of "[[Arcana Force XXI - The World]]", which can be achieved by simply resolving "Light Force". Once the player's turn begins again, "Light Force" (which will not negate itself) can be used again to search more "Arcana Force" monsters, leading into a potential [[OTK]]. Even if "Light Barrier" loses its effect during the Standby Phase, another copy can be searched by "[[Arcana Force XV - The Fiend]]".

  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Light Force]]" + 1 card
  | end     = Turn skip via "[[Arcana Force XXI - The World|The World]]" + "Light Force" and "[[Light Barrier]]" on the field
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[Light Force]]" by discarding 1 card to search "[[Arcana Force XV - The Fiend]]" and "[[Arcana Force XIX - The Sun]]".
  # Activate "The Fiend" by discarding itself to search "[[Light Barrier]]".
  # Activate "Light Barrier".
  # Activate "The Sun" to Special Summon itself, then activate its Heads effect to Set "[[Arcana Reading]]".
  # Activate the Heads effect of "Arcana Reading" to search "[[Arcana Force V - The Hierophant]]".
  # Normal Summon "The Hierophant", then activate its Tails effect to Summon "[[Arcana Force XXI - The World]]" to the opponent's field.
  # Contact Fuse "[[Arcana Force EX - The Chaos Ruler]]" using "The Hierophant", "The Sun" and "The World".
  # Activate the Tails effect of "The Chaos Ruler", searching "[[Arcana Spread]]".
  # Activate the Tails effect of "Arcana Spread" to Summon "The World" from the GY.
  # Activate the effect of "The World", and choose its Heads effect.
  # During the End Phase, activate "The World" by sending itself and "The Chaos Ruler" to the GY to skip the opponent's turn.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The Deck is reliant on coin flips if it does not have "Light Barrier" available (though the modern support makes relying on coin flips more tolerable).
  * "[[Dimension Shifter]]" prevents "Chaos Ruler" from being summoned and disables "The World's" turn skip effect, essentially shutting down the Deck.
  * Variants based around "The World" are relatively fragile to disruption and struggle to go second.

  == Trivia ==
  * The word ''[[wiktionary:arcana|Arcana]]'' is the plural of the word ''[[wiktionary:arcanum|Arcanum]]'', which means a deep secret or an unsolved mystery.
