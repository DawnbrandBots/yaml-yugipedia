  "'''Arcana Force'''" (アルカナフォース ''Arukana Fōsu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fairy]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with equal [[original ATK and DEF]] used by [[Sartorius]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. The monsters are based on the [[wikipedia:Major Arcana|Major Arcana]] [[wikipedia:tarot|tarot]] cards, each possessing a different [[wikipedia:Tarot#Occult tarot decks|symbolic meaning]]. "[[Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler]]", "[[Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler]]", and "[[Arcana Force EX - The Chaos Ruler]]" are the only "Arcana Force" monsters not based on tarot cards.

  Every "Arcana Force" monster has two possible effects, one positive and one negative. When an "Arcana Force" monster is Summoned, its [[Trigger Effect]] activates, [[coin toss|tossing a coin]] to determine which of its two effects it gains, which it keeps as long as it remains face-up on the field; heads results in its positive effect whereas tails results in its negative effect. However, while they do have two possible effects based on the result of a coin toss, "Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler", "Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler", and "Arcana Force EX - The Chaos Ruler" have two positive effects rather than one positive and one negative. The Deck has a number of support cards to help ensure "Arcana Force" monsters have their heads effect.

  In the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' anime and some video games, the coin flip is represented by the card spinning until the opponent chooses to stop it, with the effect depending on whether the card is right-side-up or upside-down. [[The Light of Destruction]] which possesses Sartorius manipulates destiny to consistently give him the positive card effect. It uses this ability and the fact that the opponent chooses when to stop the card's spinning to manipulate people during Duels, demonstrating their belief that they control their own destinies is false, but Sartorius has [[Future Sight|seen their future]] and they can change their destiny if they ally with him.

  In the ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'', "[[Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler]]" was the first "Arcana Force" card to be released. ''[[Light of Destruction]]'' debuted "Arcana Force" as an archetype, introducing a number of monsters and support cards. Several "Arcana Force" monsters and Sartorius's other cards that have appeared in the anime but not the ''OCG''/''TCG'' are included in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2]]'' as game original cards.

  == Origin ==
  With the exception of "[[Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler]]", "[[Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler]]", and "[[Arcana Force EX - The Chaos Ruler]]", the monsters are based on the [[wikipedia:Major Arcana|Major Arcana]] [[wikipedia:tarot|tarot]] cards, each possessing a different [[wikipedia:Tarot#Occult tarot decks|symbolic meaning]]. Sartorius also uses a number of Spell and Trap Cards which are based on [[wikipedia:Minor Arcana|Minor Arcana]] tarot cards, although "[[Reversal of Fate]]" is the only tarot-based Spell/Trap Card to be related to the "Arcana Force" archetype.

  Every tarot-based "Arcana Force" monster has a number in its name that matches the number of its corresponding tarot card, expressed in [[wikipedia:Roman numerals|Roman numerals]], although "[[Arcana Force 0 - The Fool]]" uses the [[wikipedia:Arabic numerals|Arabic numeral]] for zero instead due to zero not having a representation in Roman numerals. In the ''OCG'', these Roman numerals are in a different [[wikipedia:Typeface|typeface]] to [[wikipedia:Basic Latin (Unicode block)|basic Latin characters]], being the only card names in the ''OCG'' to use this typename; in the ''TCG'', standard Latin letters are used. All numbered "Arcana Force" monsters except "[[Arcana Force 0 - The Fool]]" have an [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] equal to their number × 100 + 1000; "[[Arcana Force EX - The Light Ruler]]" and "[[Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler]]", which are unnumbered, instead have 4000 ATK and DEF.

  == Playing style ==
  The deck aims to prevent the opponent from playing, either by establishing "[[Arcana Force EX - The Chaos Ruler]]", or by applying the Heads effect of "[[Arcana Force XXI - The World]]". To reliably combo, such as using using "[[Arcana Force XIX - The Sun]]" as an extender searched off of "[[Goddess of Duality]]", you need access to the Field Spell "[[Light Barrier]]". Although it does effectively nothing on its own, all of your monsters and Spells require it in order to deterministically pick which effect you will get on resolution. 

  While sometimes you can still play without it (for example, the monster summoned off "[[Arcana Force V - The Hierophant]]" can be used as material for "Chaos Ruler" regardless of the result), any sort of disruption without it will be minimal, unless you're very lucky on both your coin tosses and your opponent not having any disruption.

  "[[The Wave of Light]]" is the most important starter in the deck, getting access to "Light Barrier" through "[[Arcana Force XV - The Fiend]]" and a card to combo with it.
