  == Playing style ==
  The archetype focuses on sending "Elementsaber" monsters to the GY, which, while in the GY, can change their Attribute. Their Attribute-changing effect enables certain cards in the archetype, as well as the Summon the "[[Elemental Lord]]" monsters.

  "[[Palace of the Elemental Lords]]", the in-archetype Field Spell, is critical for the Deck; it gives a stat buff, searches for an "Elementsaber" monster (but skips the next Battle Phase), and allows "Elementsaber" monsters to send monsters from Deck instead requiring monsters from the hand. The latter effect is the most important; without it, most of the monsters go [[advantage|card negative]] to use their effects. 

  Each "Elementsaber" monster has an unique effect that can be activated by sending an "Elementsaber" monster from hand to GY, unless "Palace" is on field. Each monster, except "[[Elementsaber Lapauila Mana]]", can also change its own Attribute in the GY. See the above [[#Members|Members]] section for more details.

  "[[Elemental Training]]" is a Trap that protects the Field Spell from targeting, can Tribute an "Elementsaber" to summon a different one from Deck, and can discard the hand to search the same number of "Elementsaber" monsters.

  Each of the "Elemental Lords", meanwhile, can be Special Summoned from the hand by having exactly 5 monsters of their Attribute in the GY, which is easily manipulated through the "Elementsabers", and has a powerful effect relating to a powerful effect. Which Elemental Lord to play varies on the Deck, though "[[Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord]]'s" "[[Delinquent Duo]]" effect is the only monster that replicates a still-[[Forbidden]] card.

  Externally, the Deck can be supported by:
  * Field Spell searchers like "[[Terraforming]]", "[[Ancient Fairy Dragon]]", and "[[Metaverse]]", to get "Palace of the Elemental Lords" as consistently as possible. 
  * Warrior support like "[[Reinforcement of the Army]]" and "[[Isolde, Two Tales of the Noble Knights]]" (''OCG''/Traditional Format).
  * Archetype like "[[Chaos]]" and "[[Invoked]]", which benefit from their Attribute-changing GY effects.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "Elementsabers" are entirely reliant on their Field Spell, "Palace of the Elemental Lords", to not lose advantage with their effects. However, there is no in-archetype way to search this spell, making it inconsistent. Also, removing it with a card like "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]" or "[[Harpie's Feather Duster]]" can be fatal.
  * The archetype is heavily limited by the Normal Summon, as it lacks ways to easily Special Summon monsters out (the only monster that can Special Summon itself is "Lapauila Mana").
  * Anti-GY floodgates, like "[[Dimension Shifter]]", "[[Necrovalley]]", and "[[Macro Cosmos]]", entirely shut down the archetype's gimmick.
