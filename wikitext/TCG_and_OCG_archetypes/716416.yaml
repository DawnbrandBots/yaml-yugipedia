  "'''Relinquished'''", known as "'''Sacrifice'''" (サクリファイス ''Sakurifaisu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Spellcaster]] monsters used by [[Maximillion Pegasus]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|manga]]. It contains a single sub-archetype - "[[Eyes Restrict]]" (known as "'''Eyes Sacrifice'''" in the ''OCG'').

  Due to their Japanese names, "[[Samsara Lotus]]", "[[Samsara D Lotus]]", "[[Samsara Kaiser]]", "[[Byroad Sacrifice]]", and "[[Sword of Dark Rites]]" are also members of this archetype; however, since support for this archetype only supports monsters that cannot be [[Normal Summon]]ed/[[Normal Set|Set]], this is not an issue. While the other listed cards are thematically unrelated to "Relinquished", "Sword of Dark Rites" is a weapon based on the monster.
  ==Design==
  ===Members===
  The core intended members of the archetype are Level or Link 1 DARK Spellcaster monsters with 0 ATK, and, for the Ritual and Fusion Monsters, also 0 DEF.

  ===Support===
  Pegasus used a series of other DARK monsters alongside "Relinquished" in the manga and anime. In the card game, these monsters were later given retrained forms with effects that supported the playstyle of "Relinquished" / "Eyes Restrict".

  The archetype's associated Fusion Spell Card is "[[Relinquished Fusion]]".

  ==Playing style==
  The "Relinquished" / "Eyes Restrict" monsters all have effects that let them equip other monsters to themselves, and gain ATK/DEF equal to the monsters they are equipped with. As a Deck, the Deck generally aims to turbo out "[[Millennium-Eyes Restrict]]" as quickly as possible and equipping the opponent's monsters to it, boosting its stats to very high levels and negating the effects of the opponent's key monsters.
