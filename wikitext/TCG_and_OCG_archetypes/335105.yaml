  }}
  "'''Abyss Actor'''" ({{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|界|かい}}{{Ruby|劇|げき}}{{Ruby|団|だん}} ''Makai Gekidan'')  is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] [[Pendulum Monster]]s used by [[Sylvio Sawatari]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. It is supported by the "[[Abyss Script]]" archetype and related to the "[[Abyss Costume]]" archetype, all of which are also used by Sylvio.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  <div style="float: right">[[File:AbyssActor-Crest.png|150px|thumb|The "Abyss Actor" crest]]</div>
  The "Abyss Actor" [[Monster Card|monsters]] are based on different kinds of performing artists and staffs. The "leading" character such as "Prima Donna" features the more humanoid appearance, while the "lesser" or "evil" character such as "Evil Heel" have a monstrous appearance. Most of the "Abyss Monster" usually only have one eye visible on their face, either replaced by their crest or covered by something. Some of the monster such as the aforementioned "Evil Heel" and "Funky Comedian" features an off-center eyeball with two "mini-eyes" on it. Some monster also has an eyeball-based motif on their costumes.
  In the anime, the "Abyss Actors" change their appearances when used with "Abyss Script" cards, such as "[[Abyss Actor - Superstar]]", which dons a new costume, fitting to it performing the role of the "Abyss Script", such as being a wizard when used with "Abyss Script - Fantasy Magic" and a knight when used with "Abyss Script - Fire Dragon's Lair".

  === Etymology ===
  The "Abyss Actor" monsters tend to follow a pattern of "Abyss Actor" followed by an adjective (excluding "[[Abyss Actor - Extras]]") and then the performing art role that the "Abyss Actor" is based off of.

  == Playing style ==
  [[File:Abyss Actor.png|200px|left|thumb|[[Sylvio Sawatari]] with "[[Abyss Actor - Funky Comedian]]", "[[Abyss Actor - Superstar]]" and "[[Abyss Actor - Evil Heel]]" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V|anime]].]]
  The [[archetype]]'s playing style relies on taking advantage of [[Pendulum Summon]]. Their [[Pendulum Effect]]s [[activate]] by [[return]]ing Pendulum Monsters to the [[Extra Deck]], for Pendulum Summon or extra Scales, while several "Abyss Script" spells have effects based on the number of monsters on the [[field]].
  "[[Abyss Actor - Evil Heel]]" and "[[Abyss Actor - Funky Comedian]]" have both [[Pendulum Scale]] and Monster effects for changing ATK favourably, but are Level 8 and 1 respectively (Cannot be [[Pendulum Summon]] normally); needing the effect of "[[Abyss Actor - Trendy Understudy]]" to [[Special Summon]] them, "[[Abyss Actor - Wild Hope]]" to change the other Pendulum Scale to 9, or scale 9 "[[Abyss Actor - Twinkle Little Star]]".
  When [[destroyed by battle]] or card effect: "[[Abyss Actor - Wild Hope]]" lets you add any "Abyss Actor" card from your deck to your hand, and "[[Abyss Actor - Sassy Rookie]]" can both [[Special Summon]] a Level 4 or lower "Abyss Actor" from the Main Deck, this archetype also has many effects to return it's face-up Monsters from the Extra Deck to the hand: so these two Level 4 Monsters, "[[Abyss Actor - Extras]]" (Effect restricts Special Summoning to only "Abyss Actor" monsters) and the Trap Card "[[Abyss Actors Back Stage]]" are how this archetype searches to gain card advantage.
  The archetype is supported by "[[Abyss Script]]" [[Spell Card]]s, which can be searched by "[[Abyss Actor - Superstar]]", two of which have the most immediate impact are: "[[Abyss Script - Fire Dragon's Lair|Fire Dragon's Lair]]" for banishing 3 cards from the Extra Deck (opponent's choice) and "[[Abyss Script - Rise of the Abyss King|Rise of the Abyss King]]"  for card removal.
  "Abyss Script" Spell Cards also have secondary effects triggered when they are destroyed by your opponent's card effects, but you can also ''force'' this by giving "[[Abyss Actor - Comic Relief]]" or a face-down "[[Absorbing Jar]]" to your opponent and attacking it, or using the first effect of "[[Artifact Durendal]]".

  == Weaknesses ==
  * "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]" prevents Pendulum Monsters from being played as Spells. "[[Macro Cosmos]]" will also make the Duelist have an uphill struggle. (The "Abyss Scripts" only need to be Destroyed to activate, this will NOT prevent them from activating)
  * Being an all-DARK theme, "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" has an effect on the on-field Effects of the "Abyss Actors". "[[Chaos Trap Hole]]" is also devastating in response to an attempted Pendulum Summon. "[[Super Polymerization]]" can also be used to Summon "[[Starving Venom Fusion Dragon]]" using Abyss Actor Monsters.
  * As "Abyss Actors" are all Fiends, [[There Can Be Only One]] will slow down their play.
  * Non-destructive ways to remove the "Abyss Scripts" such as [[Cosmic Cyclone]] or [[Eldlich the Golden Lord]] are recommended.
