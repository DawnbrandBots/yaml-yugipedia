  "'''Darklord'''", known as "'''Fallen Angel'''" ({{Ruby|堕|だ}}{{Ruby|天|てん}}{{Ruby|使|し}} ''Datenshi'') in the Japanese version, is an [[archetype]] comprised primarily of [[DARK]] [[Fairy]] [[Effect Monster|Effect]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They are used by [[Midori Hibiki]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX manga|''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' manga]], and by [[Anna Des]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures]]''.

  Though members of the archetype have existed since 2001, the archetype had no support until the release of ''[[Booster SP: Destiny Soldiers]]'' in the ''OCG'' and ''[[Destiny Soldiers]]'' in the ''TCG'', both in 2016.

  == History ==
  In the ''OCG'', many of the early members of this [[archetype]] were released as ''[[V Jump promotional cards]]''.

  In the ''TCG'', the archetype's first two members, "[[Darklord Marie]]" and "[[Darklord Nurse Reficule]]", were both formerly known as "'''Marie the Fallen One'''" and "'''Nurse Reficule the Fallen One'''" respectively, suggesting that "'''Fallen One'''" was planned to be this archetype's original name in the ''TCG''. However, since the release of "[[Darklord Zerato]]" in the ''TCG'' version of ''[[Phantom Darkness]]''; all subsequent cards of the archetype introduced in all English media prior to ''Destiny Soldiers'' had "Darklord" in their names. "Marie the Fallen One" and "Nurse Reficule the Fallen One" were renamed to their current names upon their reprints in ''Destiny Soldiers'', to clearly mark their status as "Darklord" cards.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX card storylines#No. 08: Condemned Witch}}

  == Members ==
  Most members of this archetype are based on figures or concepts from Judeo-Christian and Abrahamic theology. All members are the contrasting DARK and Fairy types to represent their status as fallen angels, except "Marie" which is DARK and Fiend type.

  |}

  Lastly, "[[Darklord Zerato]]" is not related to either group, being a member of the "[[Zera]]" series instead.

  == Playing style ==
  A "Darklord" Deck focuses on [[send]]ing its cards to the [[Graveyard]] and then [[Special Summon]]ing their monsters from there, especially "[[Darklord Superbia]]", who can in turn revive another Fairy monster more than once per turn.

  Most Level 6 and higher Main Deck "Darklord" monsters from ''[[Destiny Soldiers]]'' and onwards share the following [[condition]]s and effect:
  # "''You can only Special Summon "CARD NAME(s)" once per turn.''"
  # "''(Quick Effect): You can pay 1000 [[LP]], then target 1 "Darklord" [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card|Trap]] in your GY; this effect becomes that target's effect when that card is activated, then shuffle that target into the [[Deck]]. You can only use this/each effect of "CARD NAME" once per turn.''"

  These monsters have their own unique effects, all involving [[discard]]ing "Darklord" cards except for "Nergal" who was not released in the same set as the others:

  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Darklord !! Effect
  |-
  | [[Darklord Tezcatlipoca|Tezcatlipoca]] || Can discard itself to protect a "Darklord" monster(s) from being destroyed by battle or card effects.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Amdusc|Amdusc]] || Can discard itself and one other "Darklord" card to add 1 targeted "Darklord" card in the GY to the hand
  |-
  | [[Darklord Ixchel|Ixchel]] || Can discard itself and one other "Darklord" card to draw 2 cards.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Nasten|Nasten]] || Can discard two other "Darklord" cards to Special Summon itself from the hand.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Nergal|Nergal]] || Makes all Fairy monsters inflict [[piercing]] battle damage.
  |}

  "[[Darklord Djehuty|Djehuty]]" can Special Summon any "Darkord" monster from the Deck, making it a potent starter for most "Darklord" strategies. Among those, "[[Darklord Gulgalta|Gulgalta]]" is a useful choice since upon Special Summon, it can Special Summon 2 “[[Darklord Token]]s”, then can search 1 “Darklord” card or 1 “[[Forbidden (archetype)|Forbidden]]” Quick-Play Spell whenever it is sent to the GY. This sets up perfectly for the Link Summon of "[[Condemned Darklord]]" which can then search another "Darklord" monster after "Gulgalta". "[[Indulged Darklord]]" can Special Summon one "Darklord" monster from the Deck to the opponent's field while adding another "Darklord" monster with a different name. "Djehuty" can also later banish itself to recover a "Darklord" card or a "Forbidden" Quick-Play Spell. As these two "Darklord" monsters also support the "Forbidden" Quick-Play Spells, the latter archetype of cards are useful staples that can also be searched and re-used within a "Darklord" deck.

  Sending "Darklord" cards from the hand can be done with monster effects such as those of "Amdusc, "Ixchel" and "Nasten", whereas "[[Darklord Ukoback]]" and "[[Darklord Asmodeus]]" can send "Darklord" cards or Fairy monsters respectively from the [[Main Deck]]. Bringing back "Darklord" monsters requires a more reliable solution rather than sigle-use cards such as "[[Monster Reborn]]", "[[Call of the Haunted]]" or "[[Ribbon of Rebirth]]", but within the archetype, "[[Darklord Contact]]", "[[Darklord Descent]]" and "[[The First Darklord]]" are viable choices. Although reviving is a major theme of "Darklord", a swarm playstyle is unsuitable due to many of the archetype's newer Main Deck members being limited by their shared condition. This, as well as the variety of [[Level]]s "Darklord" monsters have, makes it difficult to [[Xyz Summon]] within archetype, if not for [[Rank 8]] due to "Superbia" and "Zerato" not having said restriction.

  "[[The First Darklord]]" and "[[Darklord Eveningstar]]" are the archetype's main Fusion Monsters which require DARK Fairy monsters as [[Fusion Material]]s. Both cannot be targeted by the opponent's card effects (while "The First" extends its targetting protection to all of the user's Fairy monsters), have strong on-Fusion Summon Trigger Effects ("The First" wipes out the opponent's field if "[[Darklord Morningstar]]" is used for the Fusion Summon while "Eveningstar" can Set an archetypal Spell and Trap from the Deck), and have re-useable Quick Effects that require 1000 LP ("The First" can Special Summon any Fairy monster from the hand or GY while "Eveningstar" features the same Quick Effect of copying "Darklord" Spell/Trap effects in the GY that the aforementioned group of Main Deck "Darklord" monsters have).

  All the "Darklord" Spell/Traps serve specific purposes, each of them having no more their one effect on [[activation]]:

  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Name!! Effect and notes
  |-
  | [[Banishment of the Darklords]] || A Spell that adds 1 "Darklord" card from the Deck to the hand, except itself. It is the archetype's main searcher.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Contact]] || A Spell that Special Summons 1 "Darklord" monster from the GY in Defense position. Note that due to the effect of "Superbia" being a "when" optional Trigger Effect, Special Summoning "Superbia" via a "Darkord" monster copying this card's effect does not allow "Superbia" to activate its effect.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Dance]] || A Spell that Fusion Summons a DARK Fairy Fusion Monster (and grants the Summoned monster 1000 ATK) by banishing its materials from the hand, field or GY. It can also banish "Darklord" monsters the opponent controls if Summoning a "Darklord" Fusion Monster by this effect (such as those Summoned by "[[Indulged Darklord]]"). It serves as one of the archetype's main methods of Fusion Summoning "[[The First Darklord]]" and "[[Darklord Eveningstar]]".
  |-
  | [[Darklord Descent]] || A Trap that Speical Summons up to 2 "Darklord" monsters from the GY, which have the same Level as 1 face-up monster the opponent controls.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Enchantment]] || A Trap that takes control of 1 of the opponent's monsters until the end of this turn.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Rebellion]] || A Trap that destroys one card on the field.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Uprising]] || A Trap that Fusion Summons 1 DARK Fusion Monster using materials in the hand or field. It is the other main method of Fusion Summoning the aforementioned Fusion Monsters.
  |-
  | [[Fallen Angel in Darkness]] || A Trap that Special Summons a "Darklord" monster from the hand, Deck or banishment.
  |-
  | [[The Sanctified Darklord]] || A Trap that negate the effects of one monster on the field and gain LP equal to its ATK.
  |}

  The shared [[Quick Effect]] of the "Darklord" monsters allows a single copy of any "Darklord" Spell/Trap to be potentially "used" twice (even on the same turn, despite their [[only once per turn]] limitation per card) or during the opponent's turn whilst recycling them into the Deck for follow-up. The benefits of this effect include an additional search with "Banishment of the Darklords", additional revivals (with "Darklord Contact", "Darklord Descent" or "Fallen Angel in Darkness"), or disrupting the opponent's plays with the other Traps' effects, which can be done more easily than normally activating the Trap Cards. This is because, with the exception of "Darklord Descent", they all share the [[cost]] of sending a "Darklord" monster (or any Fairy monster in the case of "Fallen Angel in Darkness") from the user's hand or field, causing the player to lose hand/field advantage (whereas "Darklord Descent" requires half of the player's LP to be activated, causing the risk of being unable to use the copying effect of the "Darklord" monsters). This gives the "Darklord" Traps better utility as discard fodder rather than being [[Set]] in the backrow, or at least as optimal targets to [[List of unofficial terms|dump]] with "Ukoback". "Condemned Darklord" and "[[Darklord Morningstar]]", together with "Darklord Uprising" and "The Sanctified Darklord" when their effects resolve, have effects that can increase the player's LP to compensate for the usages of the aforementioned copying effect.

  In addition to Special Summoning from the Graveyard, "Darklord" has historically featured ways to [[Tribute Summon]]ing their high-Level monsters more easily. "Darklord Zerato" and "Darklord Desire" can each be Tribute Summoned with just 1 Tribute (under the appropriate condition in the case of "Zerato"). The Tribute Summon strategy is a supported by a few "Darklord" cards that works with every high-level Fairy monster; namely "Condemned Darklord" who enables the Tribute Summon of a Fairy monster that requires 2 Tributes by banishing any 2 monsters from the Graveyard, while "[[Capricious Darklord]]" allows the user to Tribute Summon a Fairy monster at any time during the Main Phase as a Quick Effect. They facilitate an easier access to Tribute Summon "Darklord Morningstar", which has an on-Tribute Summon effect to potentially Special Summon a large horde of "Darklord" monsters from the Deck, then potentially mill several "Darklord" cards for LP recursion, for "Darklord" monsters to copy their effects or revive said monsters.

  ===Other additions===
  Due to the large accumulation of DARK monsters, "Darkord" decks can also run DARK monster Deck support cards such as "[[Dark Illusion]]", "[[Allure of Darkness]]", "[[Armageddon Knight]]" or "[[Dark Grepher]]". Due to the Deck being able to regulate the number of "Darklord" monsters in the Graveyard (or rather, DARK/Fairy monsters in general), "[[Archlord Kristya]]" and "[[Dark Armed Dragon]]" can also be used. "[[Angel O1]]" can help support the archetype's Tribute Summon playstyle or provide a free [[Link Material]] on the field for "Condemned Darklord". Additionally, "[[Trade-In]]" can be used due to a number of Level 8 monsters present in the deck. 

  The addition of "[[Shadow's Light]]" and "[[Duality]]" can Summon a few useful Fairy monsters; for Level 8 ("Superbia", "Zerato", "Nergal" and "Asmodeus") there are "Archlord Kristya", "[[Invoked Augoeides]]", and "[[Flowering Etoile the Melodious Magnificat]]" and for Level 4 ("Indulged", "Capricious", "Djehuty"), "[[Herald of the Arc Light]]" is the optimal choice. Summoning "Archlord Kristya", by the mixture of the aformentioned cards in a typical "Darklord" deck, usually serves as the Deck's main "win condition". Even though the user is locked under "Kristya's'" effect, the user can simply temporarily negate its effect or destroy it with "The Sanctified Darklord" or "Darklord Rebellion" respectively if they want to Special Summon freely, or just continually Tribute Summon their high-level Fairy monsters "for free" with "Condemned Darklord".

  "Darklord" generally supports and is supported by other Fairy-oriented themes. Some noteworthy mentions that support "Darklord" include: 

  * "[[Branded]]-[[Despia]]": Since almost all Main Deck "Despia" monsters are DARK Fairy monsters, they are elligible Fusion Materials for the "Darklord" Fusion Monsters; furthermore, the "Darklord" Fusion Monsters can also be Fusion Summoned with the effects of various "Branded" Spells and Traps (ie. "[[Despia, Theater of the Branded]]", "[[Branded in Red]]" and "[[Branded Banishment]]") which are searchable with "[[Aluber the Jester of Despia]]". In addition to searching out "Despia" monsters, "[[Branded Opening]]" can also help protect the "Darklord" Fusion Monsters from being destroyed by a card effect, making them much harder for the opponent to remove on top of their 3000-5000 ATK and their effects of providing protection from the opponent's targeting card effects. In return, the "Darklord" monsters are also elligible Fusion Materials for the "Despia" Fusion Monsters, their related support and the Fusion Monsters that mention "[[Fallen of Albaz]]" as material. Given that most of those Fusion Monsters are DARK, they can also be Fusion Summoned with "Darklord Uprising".

  *"[[Melodious]]": This archetype can supplement "Darklord" by giving them more Fairy monsters to Link Summon "Condemned Darklord"; this can be accomplished without using a Normal Summon thanks to a combo that commences with resolving the effect of "[[Ostinato]]", which also adds another potent endboard monster such as "Flowering Etoile".

  ===Weaknesses===
  * "Darklord" decks have consistency issues due to their limited number of starters and having to include a few high-level monsters which do not do much on their own outside of "[[Darklord Ixchel]]". Even [[draw a card|drawing]] effects such as those of "Ixchel" does not always guarantee that one can draw into a starter.
  * Like most other DARK themes, "Darklord" is weak to most anti-[[DARK]] cards such as "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" and opposing cards that can banish monsters from the GY (such as the effects of the "[[Bystial]]" monsters and "[[D.D. Crow]]") especially when used in response to the effect of "[[Darklord Superbia]]" to revive a targeted Fairy monster.
  * The Deck does have much offense against Spell/Trap effects (other than "[[Herald of Mirage Lights]]" and the occasional "[[Herald of the Arc Light]]"), meaning that non-targeting field-clearing effects (namely "[[Evenly Matched]]") can be annoying to deal with. Field-clearing effects that destroy (such as "[[Raigeki]]") are not always effective since "[[Darklord Tezcatlipoca]]" can be discarded to protect "Darklord" monsters from destruction.
  ** "[[Super Polymerization]]" (or even "[[Darklord Dance]]" in a mirror match) can break a board of "Darklord" monsters.
