  "'''Darklord'''", known as "'''Fallen Angel'''" ({{Ruby|堕|だ}}{{Ruby|天|てん}}{{Ruby|使|し}} ''Datenshi'') in the Japanese version, is an [[archetype]] comprised primarily of [[DARK]] [[Fairy]] [[Effect Monster|Effect]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. They are used by [[Midori Hibiki]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX manga|''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' manga]], and by [[Anna Des]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures]]''.

  Though members of the archetype have existed since 2001, the archetype had no support until the release of ''[[Booster SP: Destiny Soldiers]]'' in the ''OCG'' and ''[[Destiny Soldiers]]'' in the ''TCG'', both in 2016.

  == History ==
  In the ''OCG'', many of the early members of this [[archetype]] were released as ''[[V Jump promotional cards]]''.

  In the ''TCG'', the archetype's first two members, "[[Darklord Marie]]" and "[[Darklord Nurse Reficule]]", were both formerly known as "'''Marie the Fallen One'''" and "'''Nurse Reficule the Fallen One'''" respectively, suggesting that "'''Fallen One'''" was planned to be this archetype's original name in the ''TCG''. However, since the release of "[[Darklord Zerato]]" in the ''TCG'' version of ''[[Phantom Darkness]]''; all subsequent cards of the archetype introduced in all English media prior to ''Destiny Soldiers'' had "Darklord" in their names. "Marie the Fallen One" and "Nurse Reficule the Fallen One" were renamed to their current names upon their reprints in ''Destiny Soldiers'', to clearly mark their status as "Darklord" cards.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX card storylines#No. 08: Condemned Witch}}

  == Members ==
  Nearly all members of this archetype (except for four; see below) are based on figures or concepts from Judeo-Christian and Abrahamic theology, and are the contrasting DARK and Fairy types to represent their status as fallen angels.

  Lastly, "[[Darklord Zerato]]" is not releated to either group, being a member of the "[[Zera]]" series instead.

  == Playing style ==
  A "Darklord" Deck focuses on [[send]]ing its cards to the [[Graveyard]] and then [[Special Summon]]ing their monsters from there, especially "[[Darklord Superbia]]", who can in turn revive another Fairy monster more than once per turn.

  With the exception of "[[Darklord Morningstar]]", all of the Level 6 and higher Main Deck "Darklord" monsters from ''[[Destiny Soldiers]]'' and onwards share the following [[condition]]s and effect:
  # "''You can only Special Summon "CARD NAME(s)" once per turn.''"
  # "''(Quick Effect): You can pay 1000 [[LP]], then target 1 "Darklord" [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card|Trap]] in your GY; this effect becomes that target's effect when that card is activated, then shuffle that target into the [[Deck]]. You can only use this/each effect of "CARD NAME" once per turn.''"

  These monsters have their own unique effects, all involving [[discard]]ing "Darklord" cards except for the only one that was not released in the same set as the others:

  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Darklord !! Effect
  |-
  | [[Darklord Tezcatlipoca|Tezcatlipoca]] || Can discard itself to protect a "Darklord" monster(s) from being destroyed by battle or card effects.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Amdusc|Amdusc]] || Can discard itself and one other "Darklord" card to add 1 targeted "Darklord" card in the GY to the hand
  |-
  | [[Darklord Ixchel|Ixchel]] || Can discard itself and one other "Darklord" card to draw 2 cards.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Nasten|Nasten]] || Can discard two other "Darklord" cards to Special Summon itself from the hand.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Nergal|Nergal]] || Makes all Fairy monsters deal inflict piercing battle damage.
  |}

  Sending "Darklord" cards from the hand can be done with monster effects such as those of "Amdusc, "Ixchel" and "Nasten", whereas "[[Darklord Ukoback]]" and "[[Darklord Asmodeus]]" can send "Darklord" cards or Fairy monsters respectively from the [[Main Deck]]. Bringing back "Darklord" monsters requires a more relyable solution rather than sigle-use cards such as "[[Monster Reborn]]", "[[Call of the Haunted]]" or "[[Ribbon of Rebirth]]", but within the archetype, "[[Darklord Contact]]", "[[Darklord Descent]]" and "[[The First Darklord]]" are viable choices. Although reviving is a major theme of "Darklord", a swarm playstyle is unsuitable due to many of the archetype's newer Main Deck members being limited by their shared condition. This, as well as the variety of [[Level]]s "Darklord" monsters have, makes it difficult to [[Xyz Summon]] within archetype, if not for [[Rank 8]] due to "Superbia" and "Zerato" not having said restriction.

  All the "Darklord" Spell/Traps serve specific purposes, each of them having no more their one effect on [[activation]]:

  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Name!! Effect and notes
  |-
  | [[Banishment of the Darklords]] || A Spell that adds 1 "Darklord" card from the Deck to the hand, except itself. It is the archetype's main searcher.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Contact]] || A Spell that Special Summons 1 "Darklord" monster from the GY in Defense position. Note that due to the effect of "Superbia" being a "when" optional effect, Special Summoning "Superbia" via a "Darkord" monster copying this card's effect does not allow "Superbia" to activate its effect.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Descent]] || A Trap that Speical Summons up to 2 "Darklord" monsters from the GY, which have the same Level as 1 face-up monster the opponent controls.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Enchantment]] || A Trap that takes control of 1 of the opponent's monsters until the end of this turn.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Rebellion]] || A Trap that dstroys one card on the field.
  |-
  | [[Darklord Uprising]] || A Trap that Fusion Summons 1 DARK Fusion Monster using materials in the hand or field. It serves as the archetype's main method of Fusion Summoning their sole Fusion Monster "[[The First Darklord]]"
  |-
  | [[The Sanctified Darklord]] || A Trap that negate the effects of one monster on the field and gain LP equal to its ATK.
  |}

  The shared [[Quick Effect]] of the "Darklord" monsters allows a single copy of any "Darklord" Spell/Trap to be potentially "used" twice (even on the same turn, despite their [[only once per turn]] limitation per card) or during the opponent's turn whilst recycling them. The applications of this effect include an additional search with "Banishment of the Darklords", additional revivals with "Darklord Contact" or "Darklord Descent", or disrupting the opponent's plays with the other Traps effects, which can be done with more ease than than by normally activating the Trap Cards themselves. This is because, with the exception of "Darklord Descent", they all share the [[cost]] of sending a "Darklord" monster from the user's hand or field, causing the player to lose hand/field advantage (whereas "Darklord Descent" requires the player's LP to be activated, causing the risk of being no more able to use the copying effect of the "Darklord" monsters). This gives the "Darklord" Traps better utility as discard fodder rather being [[Set] in the backrow, or at least as optimal targets to [[List of unofficial terms|dump]] with "Ukoback". "Condemned Darklord" and "Darklord Morningstar", together with "Darklord Uprising" and "The Sanctified Darklord" when their effects resolve, have effects that can increase the player's LP to compensate/allow the usage of the aforementioned copying effect.

  In addition to Special Summoning from the Graveyard, "Darklord" has historically featured ways to [[Tribute Summon]]ing their high-Level monsters more easily. "Darklord Zerato" and "Darklord Desire" can each be Tribute Summoned with just 1 Tribute (under the appropriate condition in the case of "Zerato"). The Tribute Summon strategy is a supported by a few "Darklord" cards that works with every Fairy monster; namely "Condemned Darklord" who enables the Tribute Summon of a Fairy monster that requires 2 Tributes by banishing any 2 monsters from the Graveyard, while "[[Capricious Darklord]]" allows the user to Tribute Summon a Fairy monster at any time during the Main Phase as a Quick Effect. They facilitate an easier access to Tribute Summon "Darklord Morningstar", which has an on-Tribute Summon effect to potentially Special Summon a large horde of "Darklord" monsters from the Deck, then potentially mill several "Darklord" cards for LP recursion, for "Darklord" monsters to copy their effects or revive said monsters.

  This deck, due to the large accumulation of DARK monsters, can also run DARK monster Deck support cards such as "[[Dark Illusion]]", "[[Allure of Darkness]]", "[[Armageddon Knight]]" or "[[Dark Grepher]]". Due to the Deck being able to regulate the number of "Darklord" monsters in the Graveyard (or rather, DARK/Fairy monsters in general), "[[Archlord Kristya]]" and "[[Dark Armed Dragon]]" can also be used. "[[Angel O1]]" can help support the archetype's Tribute Summon playstyle or provide a free [[Link Material]] on the field for "Condemned Darklord". Additionally, "[[Trade-In]]" can be used due to a number of Level 8 monsters present in the deck. The addition of "[[Shadow's Light]]" and "[[Duality]]" can lead into a few useful choices to Summon; for Level 8 ("Superbia", "Zerato", "Nergal" and "Asmodeus") there are "Archlord Kristya" and "[[Invoked Augoeides]]", and for Level 4 ("Indulged" and "Capricious") there is "[[Herald of the Arc Light]]". Summoning "Archlord Kristya", by the mixture of the aformentioned cards in a typical "Darklord" deck, usually serves as the Deck's main "win condition". Even though the user is locked under "Kristya's'" effect, the user can simply negate its effect or destroy it with "The Sanctified Darklord" or "Darklord Uprising" respectively if they want to Special Summon freely, or just continually Tribute Summon their high-level Fairy monsters "for free" with "Condemned Darklord".

  While "Darklord" card effects make them suitable for supporting Fairy monsters in general, they can pair well with "[[Branded]]-[[Despia]]" since almost all Main Deck "Despia" monsters are DARK Fairy monsters, making them elligible Fusion Materials for "The First Darklord"; furthermore, "The First Darklord" can be more easily Fusion Summoned with the effects of various "Branded" Spells and Traps (ie. "[[Despia, Theater of the Branded]]", "[[Branded in Red]]" and "[[Branded Banishment]]") which are searchable with "[[Aluber the Jester of Despia]]" rather than relying on just "Darklord Uprising". In addition to searching out "Despia" monsters, "[[Branded Opening]]" can also help protect "The First Darklord" from being destroyed by a card effect, making it much harder for the opponent to remove on top of its 4000 ATK/DEF and its effect of providing protection from the opponent's targeting card effects. In return, the "Darklord" monsters are also elligible Fusion Materials for the "Despia" Fusion Monsters, their related support and the Fusion Monsters that mention "[[Fallen of Albaz]]" as material. Given that most of those Fusion Monsters are DARK, they can also be Fusion Summoned with "Darklord Uprising".
