  "'''Blue Tears'''" ({{Ruby|青|あお}}い{{Ruby|涙|なみだ}} ''Aoi Namida'') is a [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]] [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[History Archive Collection]]'' in the ''OCG'' and ''[[Maze of Memories]]'' in the ''TCG'', but not supported until ''[[Duelist Pack: Duelists of Brilliance]]''. It is tied to the "[[Trickstar]]" archetype.

  == Design ==
  Each card of this theme features a stylized children's book, with "Angel" depicting the ''[[Blue Angel (book)|Blue Angel]]'' one from the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]'' anime and the others being inspired by it.

  ''Blue Angel'' tells the story of the titular character, who, due to their cold and prideful attitude, drove away all the other angels, leaving her painfully alone with her tears of blue. However, when monsters attacked her, the other angels returned to help her, as she was their friend even if she didn't think they were hers, and in this way, the crying Blue Angel learned a lesson in kindness. This story was the inspiration for [[Skye Zaizen]] to create her Blue Angel persona in [[LINK VRAINS]].
