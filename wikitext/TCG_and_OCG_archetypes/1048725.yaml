  "'''Blue Tears'''" ({{Ruby|青|あお}}い{{Ruby|涙|なみだ}}, ''Aoi Namida'') is a [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]] [[archetype]] introduced in ''History Archive Collection'' in the OCG and ''Maze of Memories'' in the TCG. It indirectly supports and is supported by the "[[Trickstar]]" archetype.

  == Design ==
  Each card of this theme features a stylized children's book, with the book ''[[Blue Angel (book)|Blue Angel]]'' also appearing in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]'' anime. ''Blue Angel'' tells the story of the titular character, who, due to their cold and prideful attitude, drove away all the other angels, leaving her painfully alone with her tears of blue. However, when monsters attacked her, the other angels returned to help her, as she was their friend even if she didn't think they were hers, and in this way, the crying Blue Angel learned a lesson in kindness. This story was the inspiration for [[Skye Zaizen]] to create her Blue Angel persona in [[LINK VRAINS]].
