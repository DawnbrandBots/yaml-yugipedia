  "'''Gishki'''", known as "'''Ritua'''" (リチュア ''Richua'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] released in ''[[Duel Terminal - Raid of the Inverz!!]]''. The archetype is a member of the [[Duel Terminal]] storyline.
  Due to their Japanese names, the cards "[[Ritual Buster]]", "[[Ritual Weapon]]" and "[[Spiritual Forest]]" are also part of this archetype.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines#DUEL TERMINAL WORLD HISTORY - AGE 1.5: The Corruption of "Noellia" to the Formation of the "Gishki"}}
  [[File:Crest-Gishki.svg|thumb|left|100px|The "Gishki" crest]]
  "Gishki" is a society of dark arts practitioners founded and led by "[[Gishki Noellia|Noellia]]", who split off from the "[[Ice Barrier]]" society, following the first war between the Duel Terminal world against the "[[Fabled]]". They wield the same [[Mirror of the Ice Barrier|powers]] as the "Ice Barrier" society, but uses it for nefarious purposes, transforming themselves into wicked monsters to further the goals of "Noellia".
  "Noellia" was originally an [[Revealer of the Ice Barrier|"Ice Barrier" mage]], who was accidentally corrupted by the "[[Steelswarm]]" during the first Duel Terminal world war, and as a result began to research into dark ritual arts, leading to her forming "Gishki" from her adopted children. "Noellia", under the influence of the "Steelswarm", began the second Duel Terminal world war by leading "Gishki" to invade the "[[Gusto]]" clan, officially for resources, but secretly to release the "Steelswarm". Faking as an ally against the "Steelswarm", "Noellia" managed to corrupt the "Vylon" into attacking the surface tribes.
  After both the "Steelswarm" and the "Vylon" were decicively defeated, "Noellia" resumed the invasion of the "Gusto", and indirectly led to the release of the "[[Evilswarm]]", causing even more chaos across the world. Eventually, the "[[Constellar]]" managed to free "Noellia" from her corruption. Wrought by guilt, "Noellia" sacrificed herself to protect her children, "[[Gishki Avance]]" and "[[Gishki Emilia]]". When "[[Sophia, Goddess of Rebirth]]" awoke and plans to reset the world, "Avance" and "Emilia" assisted in defeating "Sophia".
  After the war against "Sophia", the only known survivors from the clan are "[[Gishki Avance]]" and "[[Gishki Emilia]]". They would go on to found the "[[Nekroz]]" clan, a successor clan with more noble goals.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  Non-Ritual "Gishki" monsters typically take two forms: normal human magicians, or humanoid monsters with traits of aquatic animals. All "Gishki" [[Spellcaster]] non-Ritual monsters take the former form, and almost all "Gishki" non-Spellcaster non-Ritual monsters (with the exception of "[[Gishki Vanity]]") take the latter form.
  The "Gishki" Ritual and Xyz Monsters appears to be corrupted, transformed or even combined versions of pre-existing "Gishki" monsters with each other or with monsters from another archetype or a monster from another archetype that was transformed/revived as an "Evigishki".
  Almost all members of the archetype wear a [[Gishki Aquamirror|blue sapphire mirror]], usually around their necks or on their staves. Their faction symbol is also a stylized version of this mirror.

  === Etymology ===
  The theme's ''OCG'' name, "Ritua", is a corruption of the English word "Ritual", as used in the ''TCG'' terms "Ritual Spell Card", "Ritual Summon", and "Ritual Monster". The ''TCG'' name, "Gishki", is a corruption of the Japanese word 儀式 ''Gishiki'', meaning "Ritual" in the same context as the ''TCG'' terms, adapting the word play by reversing the language.
  All but one of the "Evigishki" members have a portmanteau name formed using a term relating to spiritual and/or psychological concepts, and a legendary creature (often a sea monster). Note that "Psychelone" and "Zielgigas" count as "Evigishkis", their ''TCG'' names being inaccurately translated.

  == Playing style ==
  "Gishki" is one of the earliest Ritual Summon-focused archetypes, and is thus centred around making up for the initial flaws of the mechanic, such as difficulty in maintaining card advantage after a Ritual Summon. This, however, has since been used to create (in)finite loops using the deck's main Ritual Spell, "[[Gishki Aquamirror]]". This has given the archetype a reputation for performing long-winded [[FTK]]s.

  The deck's main playmakers are "[[Gishki Grimness]]", in tandem with "[[Gishki Abyss]]"; the former summons the latter from the deck, which allows for a search. This usually leads to "[[Gishki Shadow]]" or "[[Gishki Vision]]", which can be discarded from the hand to search a "Gishki" Ritual Spell or Monster, respectively; they also have effects that let them be used as the entire Ritual Summon requirement for Ritual Summons of WATER Ritual Monsters. All of these cards can be searched using "Focused Aquamirror", the deck's "[[Reinforcement of the Army]]" equivalent. "Gishki" decks tend to try and use "Abyss", "Shadow", and "Vision" as much as possible over the course of the player's turn, allowing for repeated, powerful Ritual Summons. Because many of these cards are Level 2, they have synergy with the "[[Spright]]" archetype, particularly in using "[[Gigantic Spright]]" to remove un-Linkable Link-2 monsters from the [[Extra Monster Zone]].

  With these setup tools, modern Gishki combos will start with this basic setup line (as of 2024). 
  {{combo steps
  | opening = "[[Gishki Grimness]]" + "[[Gishki Shadow]]", "[[Gishki Vision]]", or a card that accesses them (eg. "[[Focused Aquamirror]])
  | end = "[[Evigishki Neremanas]]" + 2 materials, at the cost of a Battle Phase xenolock for Ritual Monsters. 
  | steps =
  # Normal Summon "Grimness" and use its effect to summon "[[Gishki Abyss]]" from the deck. 
  # Activate "Abyss" to search for either "Shadow" or "Vision", whichever Ritual Material the hand lacks. 
  # Discard "Shadow" and "Vision" to search for "[[Gishki Aquamirror]]" and "[[Evigishki Neremanas]]", respectively. 
  # Activate "Aquamirror", using "Grimness" as the entire tribute for "Neremanas". 
  # Activate "Neremanas's" effect to Special Summon "Grimness" from the GY. 
  }} 
  From here, combos can take numerous directions, usually stemming from the surfeit of Link-2 and Xyz options available for the deck. Lines include using "[[Marincess Coral Anemone]]" to reuse "Abyss" and end on multiple "Neremanas", "[[Gigantic Spright]]" to move into a [[Spright]] engine, summoning multiple Link-2 monsters to use "[[Marincess Great Bubble Reef]]", and more. To make the combo 1-card, "[[Gishki Photomirror]]" can allow for a "free" Neremanas summon, at the cost of a severe amount of [[LP]]. 

  Gishki has an auxiliary series of cards, known as "Aquamirror", which can be set in the End Phase after activating "[[Focused Aquamirror]]". Out of these, "[[Aquamirror Illusion]]" is the most attractive, allowing for a second summon of "[[Evigishki Neremanas]]" after it returns itself to the hand for a second [[negate]]. Outside of this, however, "Gishki Aquamirror" remains the only viable option, with the rest being painfully outdated in the 2024 metagame, rarely achieving much. 

  Gishki has several unique Ritual Spells, all of which summon monsters from the hand and use exact levels:
  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Mirror !! Effects
  |-
  | [[Gishki Aquamirror]] || Can shuffle itself into the deck while returning a Ritual Monster to the hand.
  |-
  | [[Gishki Photomirror]] || Pay [[LP]] equal to the monster's level *500.
  |-
  | [[Gishki Nekromirror]] || Can alternatively tribute 1 face-up monster the opponent controls regardless of level. LP is lost equal to the level of the Ritual Summoned monster's ATK.
  |-
  | [[Forbidden Arts of the Gishki]] || Ritual Summon using monsters from either side of the field; ATK is halved and the Battle Phase is revoked.
  |-
  |}

  "Gishki" Ritual Monsters have little consistency in their effects, but typically have an effect that activates on-summon; to this end, [[Gishki Vanity]] exists to insulate their summon which, by extension, will protect their on-summon effects from being chained to. Should a "Gishki" Ritual Monster not have an effect of this sort, it will typically focus on shuffling cards from the opponent's hand, field or Graveyard back to the Deck, either to break boards or to make the opponent lose card advantage. One thing is consistent, however: Not one of them has a hard once per turn clause, and this is where exploitation becomes extremely possible.

  Because "Aquamirror" requires the use of ''exact'' levels to successfully Ritual Summon, and the recursion effect of "Aquamirror" requires a Ritual Monster in GY, "Gishki" decks will typically focus on one specific level of "Gishki" Ritual Monster to build the deck around. This prompts several variants of the deck, all of which vary significantly in playstyle;
  {| class="wikitable"
  ! Level Axis !! Monster(s) !! Overview
  |-
  |10 || "[[Evigishki Neremanas]]" + "[[Gishki Zielgigas]]" || Can take multiple directions&mdash;chiefly a [[Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Gustav Max]] FTK&mdash;but can also use "Neremanas's" monster negate alongside hand traps to build a strong going-first board. "Zielgigas" provides a strong offensive push going second, having access to non-targeting shuffling into the deck, among the strongest in the game, in addition to drawing cards. Pre-Photon Hypernova, the deck took the identity of "Zielgigas Turbo".
  |-
  | 6 || "[[Evigishki Gustkraken]]" || Wins through repeatedly summoning "Gustkraken" to rip every card out of the opponent's hand, much like 2018-era "[[Topologic Gumblar Dragon]]" loops. Historically used with "[[Constellar Ptolemy M7]]", but remains possible today with "[[Drytron]]" or even in-archetype decklists. Early lists would occasionally use "Tetrogre" to take advantage of the one-sided situation and set up.
  |-
  | 6 || "[[Evigishki Mind Augus]]" || Posthumously referred to as "GishKill" and peaked in 2013. The deck notoriously achieved a slow, often 40-minute-long FTK by using the format's critical mass of draw-1 spells such as [[One Day of Peace]] to deck the opponent out, before being forced into a "Single Augus" strategy as a result of a banlist before dying out. Occasionally used "Soul Ogre" in the Side Deck to push for convincing OTKs. In modern metagames, a "[[Cyberse Clock Dragon]]" FTK is possible, using "Mind Augus" to stack the deck after milling every card in the player's deck, infinitely looping a burn card such as "[[Ookazi]]".
  |-
  | 8 || "[[Evigishki Levianima]]" + "[[Evigishki Soul Ogre]]" || Used in 2014 H.A.T format, centred around using Levianima's battle effect to gain more advantage from the Battle Phase, but has thoroughly faded out in the modern metagame.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Being a Ritual-based strategy focused on searching, "Gishki" is comically weak to anti-search effects, such as "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]", "[[Thunder Dragon Colossus]]", "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]", "[[Mistake]]" and "[[Deck Lockdown]]", largely incapacitating the deck.
  ** "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" can usually end a turn should the deck be forced to Normal Summon "Grimness". 
  * "Gishki" monsters in general lack any sort of protection, and require outside support to get a Spell/Trap negate; therefore, cards like "[[Lightning Storm]]" and "[[Raigeki]]" are excellent going second. 
  * Should the strategy not centralise around "Neremanas", the deck has zero recourse against "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]", which usually stops the "Gustkraken" and "Mind Augus" FTKs, though timings vary.
  * "Gishki's" loops centralise around "Gishki Aquamirror". Thus, cards that can remove it or prevent its usage are the best ways to deal with the deck;
  ** "[[D.D. Crow]]" can banish "Gishki Aquamirror" from the GY, which is oftentimes run at 1, usually ending the game instantly.
  ** Anti-spell cards such as the titular "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]" and "[[Imperial Order]]" (when legal), are excellent.
  ** "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" is an instant turn-ender.
  ** "[[Necrovalley]]" prevents "Gishki Aquamirror" from shuffling itself into the deck, cutting off the strategy's main source of loops completely. 
  ** "[[Gnomaterial]]", if used on a "Gishki" Ritual Monster or the first "Grimness", can wholly stop a loop, which is turn-ending should the deck not be running 3 of the Ritual Monster, or otherwise lack immediate access to the extra copy. 
  *** "[[Ghost Mourner & Moonlit Chill]]" and "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]" can also cut the player off their loops, but unlike Gnomaterial, don't outright prevent them.
  *** "[[Called by the Grave]]" is similarly effective if targeting a valuable Ritual Monster. This is particularly effective against 10-axis decks, preventing "Neremanas" from using its negation or Special Summon effects, leaving it with little recourse. 
  ** "[[Dimension Shifter]]" forces "Gishki Aquamirror" to banish itself; if chained to the activation, this can single-handedly win the game.
  * Several generic floodgates can incapacitate "Gishki":
  ** Anti-Special Summoning floodgates, such as "[[Archlord Kristya]]", "[[Evilswarm Ophion]]", "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Jowgen the Spiritualist]]" and the "[[Vanity's]]" cards can prevent the deck from summoning its Ritual Monsters.
  ** GY banishing floodgates like "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]" can damage the deck's ability to recover cards from the GY.
  ** "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]" occasionally hampers the deck, as it oftentimes uses multiple different Water-adjacent types.
  ** "[[Skill Drain]]" doesn't prevent the summoning of big bodies should the player already have a good hand, but wholly prevents the deck's main combo lines.
  ** Anti-hand effect cards such as "[[Mind Drain]]" and "[[Debunk]]" stop "Vision" and "Shadow" from functioning, which is particularly effective at stopping "Neremanas" from showing up, as its DEF is too high for "Abyss" to search on its own.
  * Because the deck spends a significant amount of LP, especially if trying to use a 1-card combo with "Photomirror", the deck becomes exploitable in several ways;
  ** A generic [[burn]] deck has an exceptionally easy time winning, usually only needing to deal 3,000 damage.
  ** Dealing 3,000+ burn damage stops the deck from summoning "Neremanas" with "Photomirror" alone, which cuts the deck off its main 1-card combo line. 
  ** The deck is extremely vulnerable to time win-cons: Its own combos tend to take an exceptional amount of time, and spending LP is sometimes inevitable.

  == Trivia ==
  * In the ''OCG'', all "Gishki" [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]] and [[Xyz Monster]]s have "Eviritua" as a part of their names. In the ''TCG'' however, the localized version of "Eviritua", "Evigishki", is not used on all "Gishki" Ritual and Xyz Monsters, with "[[Gishki Zielgigas|Zielgigas]]" and "[[Gishki Psychelone|Psychelone]]" having the standard "Gishki" name instead of "Evigishki". Since there's no card that specifically support "Evigishki" cards, this is not an issue.
  * "[[Gishki Emilia]]" and "[[Gishki Natalia]]" are [[Spirit monster]]s because they are the lingering spirits of dead characters of the "Gishki" storyline:
  ** "Natalia" died when she and "[[Gishki Noellia]]" (then still the "[[Judge of the Ice Barrier|Judge]]" and "[[Revealer of the Ice Barrier]]" respectively) tried to unseal the "[[Steelswarm]]" demons to defeat the "[[Fabled]]", as shown in the artwork of "[[Trial and Tribulation]]".
  ** "Emilia" lost her life during the [[Aquamirror Illusion|forced transformation]] into "[[Evigishki Gustkraken]]", conducted by "Gishki Noellia"; while her soul persisted, her physical body was permanently turned into "Gustkraken". Her soul was later fused with "[[Musto, Oracle of Gusto]]" to form "[[Evigishki Merrowgeist]]" when the tribes combined their powers to fight the corrupted "[[Vylon]]s", in which both "Gustkraken" and "Merrowgeist" were slain by "[[Vylon Disigma]]". "[[Gishki Avance]]" later tried to resurrect "Emilia" with the "[[Gishki Photomirror]]", but his soul was instead bound with hers and formed the rampaging "[[Evigishki Levianima]]". "Noellia", who was finally freed from the "Lswarm" virus, managed to split the two and fully resurrect "Emilia", as depicted in "[[Aquamirror Cycle]]" and "[[Spell Wall]]".
