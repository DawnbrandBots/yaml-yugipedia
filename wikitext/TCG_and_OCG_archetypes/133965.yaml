  "'''Gishki'''", known as "'''Ritua'''" (リチュア ''Richua'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] released in ''[[Duel Terminal - Raid of the Inverz!!]]''. The archetype is a member of the [[Duel Terminal]] storyline.
  Due to their Japanese names, the cards "[[Ritual Buster]]", "[[Ritual Weapon]]" and "[[Spiritual Forest]]" are also part of this archetype.
  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines#DUEL TERMINAL WORLD HISTORY - AGE 1.5: The Corruption of "Noellia" to the Formation of the "Gishki"}}
  [[File:Crest-Gishki.svg|thumb|left|100px|The "Gishki" crest]]
  "Gishki" is a society of dark arts practitioners founded and led by "[[Gishki Noellia|Noellia]]", who split off from the "[[Ice Barrier]]" society, following the first war between the Duel Terminal world against the "[[Fabled]]". They wield the same [[Mirror of the Ice Barrier|powers]] as the "Ice Barrier" society, but uses it for nefarious purposes, transforming themselves into wicked monsters to further the goals of "Noellia".
  "Noellia" was originally an [[Revealer of the Ice Barrier|"Ice Barrier" mage]], who was accidentally corrupted by the "[[Steelswarm]]" during the first Duel Terminal world war, and as a result began to research into dark ritual arts, leading to her forming "Gishki" from her adopted children. "Noellia", under the influence of the "Steelswarm", began the second Duel Terminal world war by leading "Gishki" to invade the "[[Gusto]]" clan, officially for resources, but secretly to release the "Steelswarm". Faking as an ally against the "Steelswarm", "Noellia" managed to corrupt the "Vylon" into attacking the surface tribes.
  After both the "Steelswarm" and the "Vylon" were decicively defeated, "Noellia" resumed the invasion of the "Gusto", and indirectly led to the release of the "[[Evilswarm]]", causing even more chaos across the world. Eventually, the "[[Constellar]]" managed to free "Noellia" from her corruption. Wrought by guilt, "Noellia" sacrificed herself to protect her children, "[[Gishki Avance]]" and "[[Gishki Emilia]]". When "[[Sophia, Goddess of Rebirth]]" awoke and plans to reset the world, "Avance" and "Emilia" assisted in defeating "Sophia".
  After the war against "Sophia", the only known survivors from the clan are "[[Gishki Avance]]" and "[[Gishki Emilia]]". They would go on to found the "[[Nekroz]]" clan, a successor clan with more noble goals.
  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  Non-Ritual "Gishki" monsters typically take two forms: normal human magicians, or humanoid monsters with traits of aquatic animals. All "Gishki" [[Spellcaster]] non-Ritual monsters take the former form, and almost all "Gishki" non-Spellcaster non-Ritual monsters (with the exception of "[[Gishki Vanity]]") take the latter form.
  The "Gishki" Ritual and Xyz Monsters appears to be corrupted, transformed or even combined versions of pre-existing "Gishki" monsters with each other or with monsters from another archetype or a monster from another archetype that was transformed/revived as an "Evigishki".
  Almost all members of the archetype wear a [[Gishki Aquamirror|blue sapphire mirror]], usually around their necks or on their staves. Their faction symbol is also a stylized version of this mirror.
  === Etymology ===
  The theme's ''OCG'' name, "Ritua", is a corruption of the English word "Ritual", as used in the ''TCG'' terms "Ritual Spell Card", "Ritual Summon", and "Ritual Monster". The ''TCG'' name, "Gishki", is a corruption of the Japanese word 儀式 ''Gishiki'', meaning "Ritual" in the same context as the ''TCG'' terms, adapting the word play by reversing the language.
  All but one of the "Evigishki" members have a portmanteau name formed using a term relating to spiritual and/or psychological concepts, and a legendary creature (often a sea monster). Note that "Psychelone" and "Zielgigas" count as "Evigishkis", their ''TCG'' names being inaccurately translated.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Gishki" archetype focuses on Ritual Summoning. The archetype's non-Ritual monsters focus on setting up the Ritual Summons by searching out the Ritual Monsters and Spells (directly or indirectly), and to provide tributes for "Gishki" Ritual Monsters. The two fastest "Gishki" Ritual card searchers are "[[Gishki Shadow]]" and "[[Gishki Vision]]", who can be discarded from the hand to search a "Gishki" Ritual Spell or Monster; they also have effects that lets them be used as the entire Ritual Summon requirement for Ritual Summons of WATER Ritual Monsters.
  "Gishki" Ritual Monsters focus on shuffling cards from the opponent's hand, field or Graveyard back to the Deck, either to break boards or to make the opponent lose card advantage. Most "Gishki" builds focus on going first and summoning "[[Evigishki Gustkraken]]" multiple times  in the first turn, in order to return as many cards from the opponent's hand back into the deck, forcing the opponent to start in a massively disadvantageous position.
  "Gishki" Ritual Spells have several novel effects: "[[Gishki Photomirror]]" Ritual Summons by paying LP instead of tributing monsters, "[[Forbidden Arts of the Gishki]]" can Ritual Summon by tributing the opponent's monsters (at the cost of putting heavy restrictions on the player's actions afterwards), and "[[Gishki Aquamirror]]" is a conventional Ritual Spell that has a GY effect to recover "Gishki" Ritual Monsters in the GY (and shuffles itself back into the deck) for reuse.
  A number of "Gishki" monsters, such as "[[Gishki Chain|Chain]]", "[[Gishki Avance|Avance]]", "[[Gishki Natalia|Natalia]]", and the Ritual Monsters "[[Gishki Zielgigas|Zielgigas]]" and "[[Evigishki Levianima|Levianima]]", focus on manipulating and interacting with the player's top deck to search out Ritual Monsters and Spells or activate effects; due to their slow speed, these effects are largely obsolete in the 2021 metagame.
  The going-first "Gustkraken"-focused build benefits greatly from a variant of the "[[Crystron Halqifibrax]]" → "[[Mecha Phantom Beast Auroradon]]" combo line, which uses two copies of "[[Deskbot 001]]" and generic Rank 4 monsters to repeatedly summon, send to GY, and recycle copies of "[[Herald of the Arc Light]]" to search multiple Ritual Monsters and Spells in a single turn. This can enable 3-5 summons of "Gustkraken" in 1 turn, potentially completely clearing the opponent's hand.
  Aside from Ritual Summoning, the archetype can also perform alternate combos lines such as the "[[Bahamut Shark]]" → "[[Toadally Awesome]]" line, through cards like "[[Gishki Beast]]".

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Anti-Special Summoning floodgates, such as "[[Archlord Kristya]]", "[[Evilswarm Ophion]]", "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Jowgen the Spiritualist]]" and the "[[Vanity's]]" cards can prevent the deck from summoning its Ritual Monsters.
  * Anti-searching floodgates like "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]", "[[Mistake]]" and "[[Deck Lockdown]]" can block the effects of "Gishki Shadow" and "Gishki Vision", preventing the deck from performing consistent Ritual Summons.
  * GY banishing floodgates like "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]" can damage the deck's ability to recover cards from the GY.
  == Trivia ==
  * In the ''OCG'', all "Gishki" [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]] and [[Xyz Monster]]s have "Eviritua" as a part of their names. In the ''TCG'' however, the localized version of "Eviritua", "Evigishki", is not used on all "Gishki" Ritual and Xyz Monsters, with "[[Gishki Zielgigas|Zielgigas]]" and "[[Gishki Psychelone|Psychelone]]" having the standard "Gishki" name instead of "Evigishki". Since there's no card that specifically support "Evigishki" cards, this is not an issue.
  * "[[Gishki Emilia]]" and "[[Gishki Natalia]]" are [[Spirit monster]]s because they are the lingering spirits of dead characters of the "Gishki" storyline:
  ** "Natalia" died when she and "[[Gishki Noellia]]" (then still the "[[Judge of the Ice Barrier|Judge]]" and "[[Revealer of the Ice Barrier]]" respectively) tried to unseal the "[[Steelswarm]]" demons to defeat the "[[Fabled]]", as shown in the artwork of "[[Trial and Tribulation]]".
  ** "Emilia" lost her life during the [[Aquamirror Illusion|forced transformation]] into "[[Evigishki Gustkraken]]", conducted by "Gishki Noellia"; while her soul persisted, her physical body was permanently turned into "Gustkraken". Her soul was later fused with "[[Musto, Oracle of Gusto]]" to form "[[Evigishki Merrowgeist]]" when the tribes combined their powers to fight the corrupted "[[Vylon]]s", in which both "Gustkraken" and "Merrowgeist" were slain by "[[Vylon Disigma]]". "[[Gishki Avance]]" later tried to resurrect "Emilia" with the "[[Gishki Photomirror]]", but his soul was instead bound with hers and formed the rampaging "[[Evigishki Levianima]]". "Noellia", who was finally freed from the "Lswarm" virus, managed to split the two and fully resurrect "Emilia", as depicted in "[[Aquamirror Cycle]]" and "[[Spell Wall]]".
