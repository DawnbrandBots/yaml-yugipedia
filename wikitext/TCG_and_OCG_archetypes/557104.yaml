  ; ''A Force United Against the Threat Looming Over the World!!''
  ''[[Mekk-Knight Avram|Avram]] and [[Imduk the World Chalice Dragon|Imduk]]'s journey of battle continued on, for many years. During their travels, they discovered other tribes who had been divided by the [[Mekk-Knight]]s long ago. Together with these new allies, they formed the group "Crusadia" to fight back against the threat looming over the world. Avram, who has combined the power of the [[World Legacy - "World Chalice"|World Chalice]] residing within him as well as that of the [[World Legacy - "World Crown"|World Crown]], once sealed away by the [[Crusadia Arboria|tribe of the Sacred Tree]], now marches on toward the stage of the final battle.''

  ''As their enemies were too mighty to face alone, the two begin their search for many comrades to aid in preventing the threat against the world.''

  ''The World Legacies unleash their power, letting the Crusadias take on more powerful forms...!''

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  All members of the "Crusadia" archetype wear a fragment of "[[World Legacy - "World Crown"]]" on their head, in order to signify their connection to the relic that they draw power from.

  === Etymology ===
  The archetype's name in the Japanese/Korean OCG ("Palladion") is based on [[wikipedia:Palladium (classical antiquity)|Palladium]] (also known as Palladion), from ancient [[wikipedia:Greek mythology|Greek]]/[[wikipedia:Roman mythology|Roman mythology]], a cult image of great antiquity that Rome was said to depend on. In the English language, since around 1600, it has been used figuratively to mean anything believed to provide protection or safety. "Palladion" may also refer to the word "paladin".

  The archetype's Simplified Chinese OCG name "圣骑联盟" (''Shèngqí Liánméng'') literally means "Holy Knight Alliance".

  The archetype's name in the TCG ("Crusadia") is likely based on "[[wikipedia:Crusades|crusade]]", a war instigated by religious sanctioned campaigns.
  Both paladin and crusader are character classes that often appear in RPG's. Both have similar concepts as a holy warrior of light, usually donning hallowed heavy armor, wielding a shield and a sword, possessing holy abilities, and being engaged in a holy war.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Crusadia" archetype is a [[Link Summon]]ing focused archetype. As a pure archetype, its members focus on performing [[OTK]]s through "[[Crusadia Equimax]]". If hybridized with external cards and archetypes, the archetype can use its Link abilities to perform board setup combos.
  The archetype's Main Deck members consists of 5 archetypal members, and one related "[[World Legacy]]" monster with an effect that supports the archetype, "[[World Legacy - "World Crown"]]". Each of the 6 monsters all share a [[Special Summon]]ing effect that lets them ([[Only once per turn|hard once per turn]]) Special Summon themselves to a zone that a [[Link Monster]] points to, in [[Defense Position]]. They each have additional individual effects in addition to the Special Summoning effect.

  The archetype's Extra Deck members consists of 5 Link Monsters, all of which are [[LIGHT]]. Save for "[[Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax]]", the other 4 "Crusadia" Link Monsters all share 2 [[Continuous Effect]]s that lets them gain [[ATK]] equal to the [[original ATK]] of all monsters they point to, and prevents those monsters from attacking. They each also have individual effects.

  |}
  Generally, the deck aims to perform an easy OTK by summoning "Crusadia Equimax", having it point to both "Leonis" and "Maximus", and use the effects of "Leonis" and "Maximus" on it, giving it 4800 ATK and the ability to deal double piercing battle damage against enemy monsters, allowing an OTK if it attacks anything with 800 or lower ATK/DEF. The archetype's Special Summoning abilities allows an easy Link climb into "Regulex" and "Equimax", and "Draco" and "Magius" can assist in gathering "Leonis" and "Maximus" by recovering them and searching them. Additionally, "Regulex" can search the archetype's Field Spell, "[[Crusadia Revival]]", to give "Equimax" more stat boosts for more OTK consistency.
  The "[[Kaiju]]" archetype synergizes excellently with "Equimax" and the OTK strategy; they can tribute away disruptive enemy monsters, and can be summoned to the zones adjacent to the Extra Monster Zones so that "Equimax" points to them when it is summoned, giving it even more ATK for more OTK consistency.
