  "'''T.G.'''", short for "'''Tech Genus'''" ({{Ruby|ＴＧ|テックジーナス}} ''Tekku Jīnasu''), is an [[archetype]] used by [[Bruno|Antinomy]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' and made their debut in ''[[Extreme Victory]]''

  ==Design==
  <div style="float: right;">[[File:T.G..png|200px|right|thumb|[[Bruno]] with "[[T.G. Wonder Magician (anime)|T.G. Wonder Magician]]" and "[[T.G. Hyper Librarian (anime)|T.G. Hyper Librarian]]" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's|anime]].]]</div>
  Appearance-wise, most T.G. monsters are various [[wikipedia:Cyborg|cybernetic]] lifeforms, animals primarily, infused with machines to create bio-organic lifeforms. This is enforced through the shared trait of their anime equivalents as all T.G. monsters shared the unique effect to also be treated as [[Machine]] monsters, a trait that would be later referenced through the Spell Card "[[T.G. All Clear]]".

  In the Japanese 5Ds anime, the T.G. monsters had additional codes in their names that referenced their primary [[Type]] followed by a number. For example, "[[T.G. Striker]]" in the 5Ds anime was listed as "Tech Genus Striker WA-01" in which the "WA" referred to it being a [[Warrior]] monster. This naming convention is further explored with the theme's [[Synchro Monster]]s through the inclusion of a "X" at the end of their type status and the increase to the number used at the end of the serial code that evolves further with each stage of Synchro Monster reached, reaching numbers of 1000, 10000, and ∞. The only outliers to this being "[[T.G. Hyper Librarian]]" and "[[T.G. Recipro Dragonfly]]", which have the codes of "1100" and "00" respectively
  * [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] - X-1000
  * [[Accel Synchro Monster|Accel Synchro]] - XX-10000
  * [[Delta Accel Synchro Monster|Delta Accel Synchro]] - XXX-∞

  In addition to this, all "T.G." supporting Spell and Trap Cards from the initial wave have an initialism in their names that represents their intended functions.

  ==Playing style==
  "T.G." thematically focuses on [[Accel Synchro Summon]], or [[Synchro Summon]]ing using [[Tuner Synchro Monster]]s and non-Tuner Synchro Monsters, optionally during the opponent's turn. Secondarily, some "T.G." monsters can add any 1 "T.G." monster from the Deck to the hand at the [[End Phase]] of the turn if they were destroyed on the field.

  "T.G." includes 4 "[[Accel Synchro Monster]]s" requiring [[Requires both Tuner and non-Tuner Synchro Monsters as Synchro Materials|Synchro Monsters as materials]]: the Level 10 "[[T.G. Blade Blaster|Blade Blaster]]" and "[[Shooting Star Dragon T.G. EX]]", and the Level 12 "[[T.G. Halberd Cannon|Halberd Cannon]]", and "[[T.G. Glaive Blaster|Glaive Blaster]]". They act as the Deck's in-theme end goals.

  To make these bosses during setup, the Deck has to [[swarm]] "T.G." Main Deck monsters to make multiple non-Accel "T.G." Synchro Monsters to be used as material. Non-Accel "T.G." Synchro Monsters can easily faciliatate "T.G." Accel Synchro requirements as they are either Level 5 or 2, and each Level contains Tuner Synchro Monsters (Level 5: "[[T.G. Wonder Magician|Wonder Magician]]" and "[[T.G. Star Guardian|Star Guardian]]"; Level 2: "[[T.G. Mighty Striker|Mighty Striker]]").

  The main enablers for "T.G." Main Deck swarming are their Extra Deck monsters "[[T.G. Trident Launcher]]", "[[T.G. Over Dragonar]]", and "[[T.G. Star Guardian]]"; the former two [[xenolock|lock]]s the player into only "T.G." monsters for the rest of the turn:
  * "[[T.G. Trident Launcher]]" is a Link 3 [[Link Monster]] able to summon 3 "T.G." monsters, 1 each from the hand, Deck, and GY.
  * "[[T.G. Over Dragonar]]" is a Level 5 Synchro Monster able to Special Summon any number of "T.G." monsters from the GY.
  * "[[T.G. Star Guardian]]" is a Level 5 Tuner Synchro Monster able to (indirectly) Special Summon 1 "T.G." monster from the GY.

  "T.G." main deck combo enablers are the follows:
  * "[[T.G. Screw Serpent]]": Level 4 Tuner with own on-summon extension effect.
  * "[[T.G. Rocket Salamander]]": Level 1 non-Tuner with searching and extension effect; due to being both a combo enabler and a searcher, it is the Deck's main starter.
  * "[[T.G. Tank Grub]]": Level 1 Tuner/non-Tuner who floats into a Level 1 non-Tuner Token when used as Synchro Material.

  By using and reviving "Screw Serpent" with the effects of "Over Dragonar", "Star Guardian", and "Rocket Salamander", and then using them with Level 1 non-Tuner extenders to make Level 5 Synchro Monsters, "T.G." can quickly make necessary Level 5 Synchro Monsters for Accel Synchro materials. Additional swarming (offered by cards like "[[T.G. All Clear]]", "[[T.G. Booster Raptor]]", "[[T.G. Drill Fish]]", "[[T.G. Gear Zombie]]", and "[[T.G. Warwolf]]"), accessible by searchers like "[[T.G. Limiter Removal]]", "[[T.G. Mighty Striker]]", and "[[T.G. All Clear]]", can fill in the remaining gaps needed to setup up Accel Synchro. "[[T.G. Close]]" rounds out the strategy with an extra searchable backrow interruption.

  Externally, the Deck's starter, "[[T.G. Rocket Salamander]]", can be searched by "[[Bonfire]]" or the "[[Snake-Eye]]"/"[[Diabellstar]]" engine.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * As a Synchro-focused archetype, the Deck is weak to anti-Synchro floodgates. (e.g. "[[Dimensional Barrier]]", "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]")
  * Due to the searching and tutoring needed for the Deck's main combos, the Deck is weak to anti-Searching floodgates. (e.g. "[[Mistake]]")
  * Due to the Deck featuring many different types and Attributes, it is weak to "[[Gozen Match]]" and "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]".
  * The Deck has limited in-engine removal, making it struggle to go second against an established board.
