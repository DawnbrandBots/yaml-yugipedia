  "'''Qli'''", known as "'''Qliphort'''" (クリフォート ''Kurifōto'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] introduced in ''[[The New Challengers]]'' that are designed to take advantage of the [[Pendulum Summon]] mechanic. This is reflected in the eye-shaped motifs visible in their appearances; these motifs are flanked by two crystals, one blue and another red, that are identical to the indicators of a [[Pendulum Scale]].

  In the ''TCG'', "Qli" monsters all contain the term "Qliphort" in their names, despite card texts using the more general "Qli" name.

  == Design ==
  "Qliphort" is a portmanteau of [[wikipedia:Qliphoth|Qliphoth]] (קְלִיפּוֹת, lit. "husks", the representation of evil or impure spiritual forces in [[wikipedia:Jewish mysticism|Jewish mysticism]]) and "fort". The Japanese names of several Spell/Traps use the corresponding kanji of 機殻 (lit. "machine husk") for their readings of "Qliphort" (クリフォート ''Kurifōto''), referencing the literal meaning of the word "qliphoth".

  The Qliphoth is documented in some texts of [[wikipedia:Kabbalah|Kabbalah]], a set of teachings originating in [[wikipedia:Judaism|Judaism]]. The ten emanations of the Qliphoth form the Kabbalistic Tree of Death, and each Qliphah is the polar opposite of a corresponding [[wikipedia:Sefirot|Sefirah]] on the Kabbalistic [[wikipedia:Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]].

  The majority of the names of the "Qli" monsters are related to [[wikipedia:Computing|computing]]. "[[wikipedia:Genome project|Genome]]" (''OCG'' name of "[[Qliphort Helix]]") refers to the [[wikipedia:Genome|genomes]] of biological organisms, as they bear resemblance with how computers store their data.

  Each name also references each emanation of the Qliphoth, specifically the interpretation of the Qliphoth from [[wikipedia:William G. Gray|William G. Gray's]] ''The Tree of Evil''.<ref name="org2">{{citeweb|url=http://www.ygorganization.com/jewbotpower/|title=Names and Etymology EP1: Qliphoth and Qliphort|date=September 4, 2014|publisher=YGOrganization.com}}</ref>

  "[[Qliphort Genius]]" doesn't follow this pattern, being a reference to the [[wikipedia:Genius (mythology)|genii]] of Roman mythology instead.

  == Playing style ==
  "Qlis" focus on Pendulum Summoning monsters to fuel [[Tribute Summon]]s, with effects that activate when Tributed or when Summoned by Tributing members of the archetype. Historically, their goal was to bring out the aces of the archetype - "[[Apoqliphort Towers]]" and "[[Apoqliphort Skybase]]" - while recurring monsters each turn through the Pendulum mechanic.

  All "Qli" [[Pendulum Monster]]s have 2400/2800 ATK and 1000 DEF (except "Scout", who has 1000 ATK and 2800 DEF), like the "[[Monarch (series)|Monarch]]s", and possess the following effects:
  * [[Pendulum Effect]]: ''You cannot [[Special Summon]] monsters, except "Qli" monsters. This effect cannot be negated.'' 
  ** Each monster except "Scout" and "Monolith" also has an ATK manipulating effect: those with a [[Pendulum Scale]] of 1 boost the ATK of your "Qli" monsters by 300, while those with a Scale of 9 reduce your opponent's monsters' ATK by 300.
  * Monster Effect: ''You can [[Normal Summon]] this card without Tributing. If this card is Normal Summoned without Tributing, or is Special Summoned, its Level becomes 4 and its original ATK becomes 1800. If this card is Normal Summoned/Set, it is unaffected by activated effects from any monster whose original Level/Rank is lower than this card's current Level.''

  Finally, each "Qli" Pendulum Monster is a unique combination of a Level from 5 to 8, and a Scale of 1 or 9, with the Level 5 ones being Normal Monsters with Pendulum Effects that provide card advantage for its owner, the Level 6 ones activating effects whenever they are Tributed and serving as spot removal, and the Level 7 and 8 triggering their effects when they are Tribute Summoned. The Level 9 and 10 are not Pendulum Monsters and each of them require 3 "Qli" monsters to be tributed for their Normal Summon.

  === Strategy ===
  The main strategy is to use "[[Qliphort Scout]]'s" Pendulum effect to gain card advantage, then Pendulum Summoning material for "[[Apoqliphort Towers|Towers]]", which is unaffected by practically any effect (except [[Link Monster]]s and non-activated monster effects). Because "Scout" is not a hard [[once per turn]], cards that can bounce or reset Pendulum Scales (namely "[[Performapal Trampolynx]]" and "[[Sky Iris]]") can net more advantage. "[[Summoner's Art]]", "[[Saqlifice]]" and "[[Pot of Duality]]" contribute to the consistency of searching "Scout".

  Since "Qli" Decks support Tribute Summoning, it is possible to run cards like the "[[Monarch (series)|Monarch]]" monsters or [[Egyptian God Card|Egyptian Gods]]. However, since only 1 Normal Summon is allowed per turn, these cards were rarely played.

  "[[Skill Drain]]" is useful as it can negate the downsides of "Qli" Pendulum Monsters, turning them into swarmable, high ATK beatsticks. "[[Laser Qlip]]" is also worth including, as not only does it allow you to Normal Summon an extra "Qli" monster, and prevents your opponent from negating the Normal Summons of your "Qli" monsters. Other powerful Trap Cards like "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]" and "[[Torrential Tribute]]" (as the "Qli" monsters can be Pendulum Summoned) are suggested as well.

  Pendulum Decks can use "Scout" with a card that destroys Pendulum Scales, like "[[Sky Iris]]", "[[Performapal Pendulum Sorcerer]]" or any of the "[[Metalfoes]]" Pendulum Monsters. Use "Scout" to search "[[Qliphort Monolith|Monolith]]", then Pendulum Summon "Scout" and "Monolith" to make a Rank 5 Xyz.

  The archetype was severely hampered by the [[Master Rules#New Master Rules|New Master Rules]], which limited how many monsters could be Pendulum Summoned "for free" from the Extra Deck. Also, it introduced [[Link Monster]]s, which could easily out "Towers", as Link Monsters do not have a Level or Rank. While the former could be partially mitigated with "Qlimate Change", the latter effectively ruined one of the Deck's major gameplans.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Searching with "Qliphort Scout" is important to the Deck, so removing it with a card like "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]" or "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]" can cause the Deck to lose a lot of momentum very quickly. Backrow removal is also helpful for dealing with floodgates like "[[Skill Drain]]" or "[[Lose 1 Turn]]."
  * Historically, the Deck focused on the near-invincibility of "[[Apoqliphort Towers]]" and "[[Apoqliphort Skybase|Skybase]]". Both monsters can be dealt with in a few ways:
  ** Nowadays, [[Link Monster]]s like "[[Accesscode Talker]]" and "[[S:P Little Knight]]" can easily deal with them.
  ** The Continuous Effects of monsters, such as "[[Destiny HERO - Plasma]]", will still affect them.
  ** Cards like "[[Kaiju]]s" and "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" can Tribute opposing monsters as part of their summoning conditions, bypassing the protection of "Towers"/"Skybase".
  ** Beating them over battle with cards like "[[Number S39: Utopia the Lightning]]" and "[[Number 52: Diamond Crab King]]".
  * Floodgates:
  ** Anti-Pendulum cards, like "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" and "[[Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon]]", shut down the Deck.
  ** Anti-Tribute Summon cards, like "[[Mask of Restrict]]", "[[Zombie World]]", or "[[Crimson Blader]]", will halt their gameplan.
