  == Etymology ==
  The names of "Dark World" monsters are mostly based on colors, many of which feature prominently in their artwork and their army positions. The English names are based on the words for the colors with either extra letters added/removed or corrupt spellings. The Japanese names are based on the transcriptions of the English words for the colors with one or more [[wikipedia:Mora (linguistics)|morae]] deleted. The Chinese names are combinations of the color names and [[wikipedia:Transcription into Chinese characters|transcription]]s/transliterations of English or Japanese words, in terms of phonetics.

  == Playing style ==
  "Dark World" is a discard-focused archetype; almost all of its monsters have [[Trigger Effect]]s that provide advantage when they are [[discard]]ed from the [[hand]] to the [[Graveyard|GY]] by a card [[effect]] (and importantly, not when they are discarded for a cost, such as with "[[Knightmare]]" monsters), and provide additional advantage when said discard effect was an opponent's effect.

  While earlier "Dark World" decks are [[beatdown]] decks revolving around "[[Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World]]", most "Dark World" decks in 2023 are combo decks focused on [[swarm]]ing monsters to make generic Extra Deck boss monsters and [[handloop]] the opponent with "[[Sillva, Warlord of Dark World]]".

  The main "Dark World" monster discard trigger effects are as follows:
  <!-- This is not a Decklist. Please only add "Dark World" monsters with effects that activate under conditions in which it was discarded.-->

  </references>

  Many of these effects are not once per turn, meaning that, as long as the player has the discard outlet and recovery, they can repeatedly trigger "Dark World" trigger effects and repeatedly gain advantage. In-archetype, the "recovery" comes from "[[Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World]]" and "[[Reign-Beaux, Overking of Dark World]]"; both can revive themselves by bouncing a friendly "Dark World" monster. The player can thus discard a self-reviving "Dark World" and then bounce it with "Grapha"/"Reign-Beaux", allowing it to be discarded again for more advantage.

  "Dark World" Decks require cards that discard as an effect to enable their trigger effects. In-archetype, this is primarily enabled by:
  * "[[Dark World Dealings]]" (2 for 1 card cycling)
  * "[[The Gates of Dark World]]" (searchable by "[[Genta, Gateman of Dark World]]"; 1 for 1 cycling)
  * "[[Charge Into a Dark World]]" (revive)
  * "[[Dark World Lightning]]" (destroy backrow)
  * "[[Dark Corridor]]" (search "Dark World" monster)
  * "[[Dark World Puppetry]]" (banish from opponent's GY)
  * "[[Dark World Accession]]" (Fusion Summon with discards, and discard to add itself from GY to hand)
  * "[[Dark World Archives]]" (give ATK, and 1 for 2 card cycling)
  * "[[Dark World Punishment]]" (monster summon negate)

  Externally, other cards that discard as an effect and provide advantage include:
  * "[[Muckraker From the Underworld]]" (revive)
  * "[[Number 60: Dugares the Timeless]]" (1 for 2 card cycling)
  * "[[Danger!]]" monsters (summon "Danger!" monsters and draw)
  * "[[Dark Smog]]" (banish from opponent's GY)

  While the stronger "discarded by an opponent's effect" Trigger Effects are generally unreliable due to the rarity of such effects, a small number of cards, including some "Dark World" cards, can artificially create such situations (and sometimes even generate advantage while doing so), allowing for more consistent combos involving these Trigger Effects. These include:
  * "[[Ceruli, Guru of Dark World]]": By summoning it to the opponent's field with a "Dark World" card effect (including its own), "Ceruli", now an opponent's card, will mandatorily make the "Dark World" player discard 1 card.
  * "[[Ken the Warrior Dragon]]": By summoning it to the opponent's field with "[[Gen the Diamond Tiger]]", "Ken" will mandatorily make the "Dark World" player draw 2 cards and discard 1 card.
  * "[[Dark World Brainwashing]]", "[[Fabled Dianaira]]", "[[Dark Deal]]", "[[Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World]]": They each can change an opponent's card effect to one that causes the player to discard; this functionally also acts as a [[negate]].

  Typically, a "Dark World" deck is played alongside "Danger!" monsters to mass swarm monsters, using them to make generic Link/Xyz Extra Deck boss monsters, and also to Fusion Summon "[[Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World]]" with "[[Dark World Accession]]". The "Danger Dark World" deck often also aims to summon "Ceruli" to the opponent's field and use it to discard "Sillva" twice, handlooping the opponent for 4.

  === Additional synergies ===
  * Since the archetype's two strongest [[Main Deck]] monsters are Level 8 and can Special Summon themselves, Rank 8 monsters can also be included.
  ** "[[Coach King Giantrainer]]" can be helpful, since it can draw 3 cards and putting all of those monsters back in the GY to allow them to Summon themselves again.
  * "[[Akashic Magician]]" and "[[Security Dragon]]" can return a "Ceruli" on the opponent's field to the hand for reuse.
  * Some "[[Fabled]]" monsters also activate effects when they are discarded, enabling [[Synchro Summon]]s. "[[Fabled Raven]]" also discards cards as an effect to enable multiple "Dark World" activations.
  * The effect of "Ceruli" from the opponent's field will allow a player to activate "[[Triple Tactics Talent]]" and "[[Triple Tactics Thrust]]".
  * Since most "Dark World" monsters activate their effects in the GY, it is possible to use "[[Skill Drain]]" while still making the most of these effects.
  * "[[Neko Mane King]]" can be used as a discard fodder for "[[Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World]]'s" effect, thus enable its turn-ending effect and potentially skips the opponent's entire turn if used early.

  === Weaknesses and counter-strategies ===
  * [[Floodgate]]s this Deck is weak against:
  ** Anti-GY floodgates (e.g. "[[Dimension Shifter]]", "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]").
  ** Anti-Special Summoning floodgates (e.g. "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Vanity's Fiend]]")
  ** Anti-DARK floodgates (e.g. "[[Consecrated Light]]", "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]")
  * "[[Abyss Dweller]]", "[[Georgius, Swordman of the Ice Barrier]]", "[[Soul Drain]]", "[[The End of Anubis]]", "[[Skull Meister]]" and the aforementioned "Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror" will stop "Dark World" monsters from activating their effects in the GY. "Soul Drain" in particular will prevent "Genta, Gateman of Dark World" from returning to the field after being banished.
  * Random chance can influence this deck greatly, between the random discards of "Danger!" monsters and the reliance on drawing to generate card advantage. Because of this, the deck cannot use many non-engine cards in order to maintain consistency.
  * Because the "Danger!/Dark World" combo depends on adding cards or drawing multiple times in a single turn, "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" will shut down the deck instantly. However, this can be resolved by having "[[Called by the Grave]]".
  * In a [[Mirror Match]], any cards that make both players discard will become a double-edged sword.
  * Due to the possible sequence of multiple effects or Special Summons performed in a single turn, "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" could also be dangerous to this Deck.
  * In terms of Fiend monsters specifically, cards that change Types on the field and GY such as "[[Zombie World]]" will render "The Gates of Dark World" unable to work due to its requirement of Fiend monsters for banishing.
  * "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" and "[[Chaos Hunter]]", in some way, also can affect "Dark World" monsters as "The Gates of Dark World" cannot use its effect of banishing monsters, and "Dark World Accession" could end up being rendered useless and locking the player out of Fusion Summoning "Grapha, Dragon Overlord of Dark World" should the player have all copies of "Grapha, Dragon Lord of Dark World" either on the field or in the GY.
