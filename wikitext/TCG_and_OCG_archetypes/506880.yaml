  "'''Ancient Gear'''", known as "'''Antique Gear'''" (アンティーク・ギア ''Antīku Gia'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] (with the exception of "[[Chaos Ancient Gear Giant]]" being [[DARK]] monster) used by [[Vellian Crowler]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'', [[Rudolph Heitmann]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' and [[Duel Academy (ARC-V)|Duel Academy]] students' personnel, such as [[Yuri]], [[Dennis McField]], [[Jean Michel Roget]] and the [[Obelisk Force]] members, in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''.

  It also has a sub-archetype: "[[Ancient Gear Golem (archetype)|Ancient Gear Golem]]", as well as a sub-series of Gadjiltron monsters designed to support the "[[Gadget]]" archetype.

  == Lore ==
  When "Ancient Gear" monsters are used as [[Fusion Material]]s by [[Duel Academy (ARC-V)|Duel Academy]] members in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime, the [[Summon chants in Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V|Summon chants]] mention that they carry "ancient spirits" or other similar terms. This seems to imply that the "Ancient Gear" monsters may be old machines possessed by spirits, which could explain their functioning despite their old workings and also be the reason behind their glowing eyes. The wallpaper version of "[[Ancient Gear Advance (Master Duel)|Ancient Gear Advance]]" in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel]]'' also mentions that they are infused with ancient spirits, and are united in their purpose to eliminate every enemy in sight.

  == Design ==
  [[File:Ancient Gears Linework.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Linework of "[[Ancient Gear Soldier|Soldier]]", "[[Ancient Gear Golem|Golem]]" and "[[Ancient Gear Beast|Beast]]"]]

  True to their name, all "Ancient Gear" monsters resemble variously designed robots, with skeletal bodies featuring unions of cogwheels and gears joining several parts together, and most of the [[Main Deck]] monsters feature gears in their backgrounds. The humanoid "Ancient Gears" also bear a striking similarity to Ancient Greek soldiers, thus their conception may be based on the [[wikipedia:Antikythera mechanism|Antikythera mechanism]].

  The name "Ancient Gear (Antique Gear)" is likely a reference to the old age of the mechanism that governs their functioning, which normally would require an external force to move them but interestingly enough they seem to be self-sufficient. This may imply that, contrarily to their apparent antiquity, they are far more advanced than they look, as hinted by the censorship of some of their artworks when they were released in the ''TCG''.

  == Playing style ==
  "Ancient Gear" is an aggressive OTK deck with an emphasis on [[Tribute Summon]]ing and [[Fusion Summon]]ing. In terms of shared effects, "Ancient Gear" monsters typically prevent the opponent from activating cards or effects in the [[Battle Phase]]. Other shared monster effects include multiple attacks, inflicting [[piercing]] damage. Some "Ancient Gear" Spells feature effects that trigger when they are destroyed, which is enabled by other "Ancient Gear" card effects that destroy the player's own Spells for advantage.

  In terms of Summoning, some "Ancient Gear" high-Level Main Deck monsters typically focus on Tribute Summoning, as they typically cannot be Special Summoned, and typically gain additional effects if the monster is Tribute Summoned using specific tributes. Specifically, "[[Ancient Gear Gadjiltron Chimera]]" and "[[Ancient Gear Gadjiltron Dragon]]" gain effects if they're Tribute Summoned using specific "[[Gadget]]" monsters, while "[[Ancient Gear Reactor Dragon]]" and "[[Ancient Gear Hydra]]" gain effects if they're Tribute Summoned using "Ancient Gear" or "Gadget" monsters in general. This connection with the "Gadget" archetype is further strengthened by "[[Ancient Gear Gadget]]", who belongs to both archetypes, and can change its name to that of any other "Gadget" monster.

  The Deck's main searchers are "[[Ancient Gear Wyvern]]" and "[[Ancient Gear Dark Golem]]", who search on Summon, "[[Ancient Gear Statue]]", who Tributes itself to summon a monster mentioning "Ancient Gear Golem", "[[Ancient Gear Ballista]]", who only searches monsters (as well as "[[Geartown]]"), but is an accessible Link 2 Extra Deck monster, "[[Ancient Gear Box]]", who searches another monster upon being added to the hand, as well as "[[Ancient Gear Advance]]", which searches Spells and Traps and gives the optional for an additional draw. The Deck contains two other important, but conditional monster searchers: "[[Ancient Gear Catapult]]", who Summons an "Ancient Gear" from Deck (ignoring its Summoning conditions) by destroying a face-up card while the player controls no monsters, and "[[Geartown]]", who Summons an "Ancient Gear" from Deck when destroyed. "[[Ancient Gear Frame]]" is a secondary S/T searcher with narrow search range, but it can still be used to search out the Deck's key archetypal [[Fusion (archetype)|Fusion]] Spell, "[[Ancient Gear Fusion]]".

  The Deck's main win conditions are the Fusion Monsters: "[[Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem]]", when supplemented by "[[Ancient Gear Duel]]", as well as "[[Chaos Ancient Gear Giant]]" - which requires 4 "Ancient Gear" monsters as Fusion Materials. The former's 4400 ATK (or 5000 ATK following the effect of "Tanker") and the latter's 4500 ATK place them above the majority of monsters in the game, this combined with piercing, and multi-attack, means they are able to rapidly close out games if summoned. Other Fusion Monster options include "[[Ancient Gear Howitzer]]", a 2-material defensive Fusion with effect immunity, burn damage, and floating effects, and "[[Ancient Gear Megaton Golem]]", a 3-material Fusion with conditional multi-attack, and can float into "Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem".

  To utilize "Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem" effectively, the deck aims to get "Ancient Gear Duel" (primarily achieved with the effect of "[[Ancient Gear Commander]]"), as well as "Ancient Gear Dark Golem" on the field, to facilitate summoning, with the option of trying to bring out "[[Ancient Gear Tanker]]" along the way to increase the ATK of "Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem" to 5000. To summon "Chaos Ancient Gear Giant", the Deck aims to search out the necessary resources for Fusion Summon, i.e. 4 "Ancient Gear" monsters + a card with a Fusion effect, or Summoning an "[[Ancient Gear Golem]]" and using "Ancient Gear Fusion", which allows using in-Deck Fusion Materials when the player controls "Golem". To support the former, "[[Ancient Gear Hunting Hound]]" provides is a searchable "Ancient Gear" monster with a Fusion effect.

  "Ancient Gear" also have an additional defensive [[Negate]] monster: "[[Ancient Gear Dragon]]", who can easily be summoned using  "[[Ancient Gear Tanker]]" or "Statue", and searched with "Box".

  Miscellaneous "Ancient Gear" support effects include Tribute support like "Geartown" and "[[Ancient Gear Castle]]", GY recovery with "[[Ancient Gear Fortress]]", "[[Ancient Gear Reborn]]", and "[[Ancient Gear Workshop]]", and protection through "[[Ancient Gear Fortress]]".

  Being an [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] Deck, "Ancient Gear" can also be combined with "[[Machina]]", "[[Infinitrack]]", and/or [[Train]]s monsters for more combo opportunities. Among these monsters, "[[Machina Citadel]]" is especially useful in an "Ancient Gear" deck, while "Infinitrack" monsters have good synergy with "Box", due to many having 500 ATK or DEF.

  Externally, the Deck synergizes with the "[[Metalfoes]]" archetype, which provide face-up Pendulum Cards to be destroyed by "Catapult", and can destroy "Geartown" to Summon from Deck. Moreover since they can enable Pendulum Summons they can greatly facilitate the Tribute Summon of "Reactor Dragon" or "Hydra" and if "Gold and Silver Gadget" are Special Summoned this way, they can be destroyed so the player can search both "Metalfoes" cards and "Ancient Gear Gadget". However, the use of "Wyvern" prevents the use of "Metalfoes" cards.

  An "Ancient Gear" deck can also opt to run a small "[[Fusion Destiny]]" engine, "[[Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer]]" can be used to destroy it's players own "Geartown" to facilitate summoning via it's effect, and the GY effect of "[[Destiny HERO - Dasher]]" to summon a drawn monster can help with the lack of swarming "Ancient Gear" requires to summon Link monsters.

  === Weaknesses ===
  Cards like "[[Acid Rain]]", "[[Magnetic Mosquito]]", and "[[System Down]]" have the potential to disrupt an "Ancient Gear" Deck. Although these cards can be hard to counter, "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]", "[[Starlight Road]]", "[[The Huge Revolution is Over]]" and other Spell/Trap negation cards can prevent them activating.

  Finally, being Machine Monsters, they can be used as Fusion Materials for an opponent's "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]".
