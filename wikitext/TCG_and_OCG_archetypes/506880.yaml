  "'''Ancient Gear'''", known as "'''Antique Gear'''" (アンティーク・ギア ''Antīku Gia'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] (with the exception of "[[Chaos Ancient Gear Giant]]" being [[DARK]] monster) used by [[Vellian Crowler]] and [[Dimitri]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'', [[Rudolph Heitmann]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' and [[Duel Academy (ARC-V)|Duel Academy]] students' personnel, such as [[Yuri]], [[Dennis McField]], [[Jean Michel Roget]] and the [[Obelisk Force]] members, in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''.

  It also has a sub-archetype: "[[Ancient Gear Golem (archetype)|Ancient Gear Golem]]", as well as a sub-series of Gadjiltron monsters designed to support the "[[Gadget]]" archetype.

  == Lore ==
  When "Ancient Gear" monsters are used as [[Fusion Material]]s by [[Duel Academy (ARC-V)|Duel Academy]] members in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime, the [[Summon chants in Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V|Summon chants]] mention that they carry "ancient spirits" or other similar terms. This seems to imply that the "Ancient Gear" monsters may be old machines possessed by spirits, which could explain their functioning despite their old workings and also be the reason behind their glowing eyes. The wallpaper version of "[[Ancient Gear Advance (Master Duel)|Ancient Gear Advance]]" in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel]]'' also mentions that they are infused with ancient spirits, and are united in their purpose to eliminate every enemy in sight.

  == Design ==
  [[File:Ancient Gears Linework.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Linework of "[[Ancient Gear Soldier|Soldier]]", "[[Ancient Gear Golem|Golem]]" and "[[Ancient Gear Beast|Beast]]"]]

  True to their name, all "Ancient Gear" monsters resemble variously designed robots, with skeletal bodies featuring unions of cogwheels and gears joining several parts together, and most of the [[Main Deck]] monsters feature gears in their backgrounds. The humanoid "Ancient Gears" also bear a striking similarity to Ancient Greek soldiers, thus their conception may be based on the [[wikipedia:Antikythera mechanism|Antikythera mechanism]].

  The name "Ancient Gear (Antique Gear)" is likely a reference to the old age of the mechanism that governs their functioning, which normally would require an external force to move them but interestingly enough they seem to be self-sufficient. This may imply that, contrarily to their apparent antiquity, they are far more advanced than they look, as hinted by the censorship of some of their artworks when they were released in the ''TCG''.

  == Playing style ==
  "Ancient Gear" is an aggressive blind second [[OTK]] Deck, with an emphasis on [[Fusion Summon]]ing. In general, the gameplan is to protect its plays with "[[Ancient Gear Fortress]]" (ideally), and bring out their bosses like "[[Chaos Ancient Gear Giant]]" and "[[Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem]]" to deal lethal damage. 

  There are several shared effects. Monsters in the archetype often prevent the opponent from activating cards/effects in the Battle Phase, and their bosses can attack multiple times and deal [[piercing]] damage. Some "Ancient Gear" Spells have effects when destroyed, which is enabled by other "Ancient Gear" card effects that destroy the player's own Spells for advantage. In addition, older cards tend to encourage Tribute Summoning, with several high Level monsters that cannot be Special Summoned, and/or gain additional effects when Tribute Summoned using specific tributes. To get around the restriction, newer support cards like "[[Ancient Gear Commander]]" can [[Ignoring the Summoning conditions|ignore summoning conditions]].

  The Deck's main searchers are:
  * "[[Ancient Gear Wyvern]]", "[[Ancient Gear Dark Golem]]", and "[[Ancient Gear Ballista]]", which search on Summon.
  * "[[Ancient Gear Statue]]" and "[[Ancient Gear Catapult]]", which can both Summon an "Ancient Gear" monster (ignoring summoning conditions).
  * "[[Ancient Gear Box]]", which if searched, can then search an EARTH Machine with 500 ATK/DEF. This was primarily run to generate extra Fusion material, and modern builds generally don't run it.
  * "[[Ancient Gear Advance]]", which searches Spells/Traps and gives the option for an additional draw.
  * "[[Geartown]]", which Summons an "Ancient Gear" if destroyed.
  * "[[Ancient Gear Frame]]", a conditional searcher that gets to the essential "[[Ancient Gear Fusion]]".

  The Deck's main win conditions are the Fusion Monsters, and which one to bring out to close the game will depend on the scenario. "[[Chaos Ancient Gear Giant]]" requires 4 Fusion Materials, but is supported by "[[Ancient Gear Fusion]]", which can Fusion using materials from Deck if controlling "Ancient Gear Golem", it is best for when the opponent has many monsters on the field, or dangerous battle phase effects. "[[Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem]]" is used when the opponent has few monsters, being summoned and supported by "[[Ancient Gear Duel]]" to give it 3 attacks ("[[Ancient Gear Commander]]" is the main way to get "Duel" face-up on the field), with "[[Ancient Gear Tanker]]" also boosting its ATK to 5000 under the right circumstances. Other Fusion Monster options include "[[Ancient Gear Howitzer]]", a 2-material Fusion that is an [[unaffected]] recruiter and deals minor burn damage, and "[[Ancient Gear Megaton Golem]]", a 3-material Fusion with conditional multi-attack, which can float into "Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem".

  "[[Ancient Gear Fortress]]" is key to the Deck, a Continuous Spell that prevents the opponent from responding to "Ancient Gear" card effects, gives monsters targeting and destruction protection, and if destroyed, can Special Summon from hand or GY. Other Spell/Trap support includes "[[Ancient Gear Reborn]]" and "[[Ancient Gear Workshop]]" for GY recovery, or "[[Geartown]]" and "[[Ancient Gear Castle]]" for Tribute support. Also, "[[Ancient Gear Dragon]]" is monster that can [[negate]] a Spell/Trap that can easily be summoned using  "Tanker" or "Statue", and searched with "Box".

  === External Cards ===
  "[[Urgent Schedule]]" is a starter for the Deck, able to summon two negated [[EARTH]] [[Machine]]s if the opponent controls more monsters than the player. "[[Clockwork Knight]]" supports this card, as it can be Link Summoned using a negated "[[Ancient Gear Statue]]", then revive the "Statue" without negating it. It's possible to run a high Level EARTH Machine, such as "[[Machina Citadel]]" or "[[Super Express Bullet Train]]", as an extra target to summon off "[[Urgent Schedule]]", although they are bricks. "Citadel" will trigger off the effect of "Tanker" meaning it can be weaved into an "Urgent Schedule" combo to help clear the opponent's monsters during the Battle Phase. 

  "[[Therion "King" Regulus]]" can also be run as a going first option for the deck being searchable off "[[Gigantic "Champion" Sargas]]" - which "Ancient Gear" can easily facilitate the summon of. The archetype could be combined with other [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] archetypes, such as "[[Machina]]", "[[Infinitrack]]", and/or [[Train]]s. However, "Ancient Gear Fortress" can only protect "Ancient Gear" cards, leaving the other EARTH Machine archetypes unprotected.

  The "[[Metalfoes]]" archetype provides face-up Pendulum Cards to be destroyed by "Catapult", and can destroy "Geartown" to Summon from Deck. Moreover since they can enable Pendulum Summons, they can greatly facilitate the Tribute Summon of "Reactor Dragon" or "Hydra" and if "Gold and Silver Gadget" are Special Summoned this way, they can be destroyed so the player can search both "Metalfoes" cards and "Ancient Gear Gadget". However, the use of "Wyvern" prevents the use of "Metalfoes" cards.

  A small "[[Fusion Destiny]]" engine could be run, as "[[Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer]]" can be used to destroy the player's own cards, and the GY effect of "[[Destiny HERO - Dasher]]" to summon a drawn monster can help with the lack of swarming "Ancient Gear" requires to summon Link monsters. However, because of "Fusion Destiny's" summon lock, this clashes with the blind second playstyle, meaning it is generally only useful if the "Ancient Gear" player is being forced into going first.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Anti-Machine cards, like "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" and "[[System Down]]", are effective at clearing their boards, although they don't do anything against an "Ancient Gear" player going second.
  * As an OTK Deck, it can struggle if prevented from dealing battle damage (e.g., "[[Waboku]]") or if forced to go first.
  * Many "Ancient Gear" cards, and "[[Urgent Schedule]]", depend on the opponent controlling monsters. It's still possible for the archetype to OTK against an empty board, but more difficult.
