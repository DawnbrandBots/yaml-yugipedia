  "'''Cyber Angel'''" (サイバー・エンジェル, ''Saibā Enjeru'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Fairy]] [[Ritual Monster]]s used by [[Alexis Rhodes]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, as well as her [[Alexis Rhodes (ARC-V)|alternate universe counterpart]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. They are supported by the "[[Machine Angel]]" archetype, which includes the archetype's Ritual Spells. Originally playable in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Tag Force|Tag Force]]'' games, they were first released in the ''[[Collectors Pack: Duelist of Flash Version]]''.
  The "Cyber Angels" are based on both gods and creation myths of Asian mythologies, such as Buddhism and Hinduism. Their names are written in [[wikipedia:Ateji|Ateji]]－their names use kanji, but only for their pronunciation without any regard for the meaning of the characters.

  == Playing style ==
  "Cyber Angel" cards rely on [[Ritual Summon]]ing and then recycling Monster cards and granting effects to aid more Summon Rituals for next turn. Also having "[[Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands]]" to search for cards to further aid strong field presence.
  "Benten" inflicts [[effect damage]] when it destroys a monster by battle, and can search any [[LIGHT]] [[Fairy]] monster when [[Tribute]]d. "Idaten" immediately recycles a [[Ritual Spell Card]] when Summoned, and grants all Ritual Monsters you control an additional 1000 [[ATK]]/[[DEF]] when Tributed. "Dakini" allows a Ritual Monster to deal [[piercing]] battle damage, and can add a Ritual Spell Card or Ritual Monster from the [[Graveyard]] to your [[hand]] at the end of each of your turns.
  "Vrash" destroys all of your opponent's monsters summoned from the [[Extra Deck]] when Ritual Summoned, inflicts 1000 points of effect damage for each monster destroyed, can attack twice that turn if it does so, and can negate a card's destruction once per turn by shuffling a Ritual Monster in your Graveyard back into the Deck. Finally, "Natasha" allows you to increase your [[LP]] equal to half the [[ATK]] of a face-up monster on your side of the field and negates any attacks directed to Ritual Monsters you control. Additionally, when "Natasha" is in the graveyard after having been properly Ritual Summoned before, you can [[banish]] a "Cyber Angel" monster from your Graveyard, [[Special Summon]] "Natasha" and take control of an opponent's monster.

  Although pure "Cyber Angel" Decks may be sparse or not as powerful as fellow Ritual Decks, their monsters (namely "Benten" and "Natasha") can be vital tools for said Ritual Decks regardless of their focus. Since "Benten" is a Level 6 LIGHT Fairy, it can be searched with "[[Preparation of Rites]]" and effectively refund the cost of using it for Ritual Summon fodder by searching a LIGHT Fairy afterwards, including not only itself but valuable monsters like "[[Diviner of the Herald]]" that are capable of starting or extending Ritual setups.
