  "'''Purrely'''" (ピュアリィ ''Pyuaryi'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Fairy]] monsters with different attributes introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Amazing Defenders]]''/''[[Amazing Defenders]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 06: Purrely}}

  == Etymology ==
  "Purrely" may be a portmanteau of "pure", "purr" and "fairy" while also playing on the word "purely".

  == Design ==
  "Purrely" monsters have canine and feline traits, with the [[Xyz Monster]]s depicting the growth of the [[Purrely (card)|namesake monster]] into upgraded forms of various [[Attribute]]s. The "Purrely" [[Quick-Play Spell]]s depict photos of "Purrely" taken by its unseen owner (revealed to be a young girl in its concept art).

  == Playing style ==
  "Purrely" is a theme focused on using the namesake Level 1 monster [[Purrely (card)|"Purrely"]] to reveal a "Purrely" [[Quick-Play Spell Card]] from your hand with its effect, then [[Special Summon]]ing a [[Rank]] 2 [[Xyz Monster]] which mentions that Quick-Play Spell in its text using "Purrely" and the revealed card as materials - from there, the objective is to stack further materials onto those Xyz Monsters through their effects. Each of the Rank 2 "Purrely" Xyz Monsters has a unique effect that gains a bonus effect if it has a specific "Purrely" Quick-Play Spell as a material; each one also shares an effect where, thrice per turn as a [[Quick Effect]], you can attach activated "Purrely" Quick-Play Spells to that monster as material with a bonus effect depending on the Rank 2 in question - this varies from temporary removal of cards on the field to changing battle positions.

  Their primary boss monster is "[[Expurrely Noir]]", a Rank 7 Xyz Monster than can be Xyz Summoned using a Rank 2 Xyz Monster with 5 or more materials. "Expurrely Noir" is an extremely powerful defensive monster that can repeatedly return the opponent's cards from their field or graveyard into the deck by detaching two Xyz materials. Notably, "Noir's" removal effect is not restricted to being used once per turn or even once per chain, allowing it to either completely derail a strategy single-handedly or force removal through negation or quick-effect anti-targeting effects. Additionally, "Expurrely Noir" is unaffected by the opponent's activated effects while it has 5 or more materials, making it fairly difficult to remove before its removal effect is able to inflict crippling damage to the opponent's setup.

  Their secondary boss monster is "[[Expurrely Happiness]]", a Rank 7 Xyz Monster than can also be Xyz Summoned using a Rank 2 Xyz Monster with 5 or more materials. "Expurrely Happiness" is a more aggressively focused monster with an offensive statline that can negate the effects of all your opponent's monsters during your Main Phase and until the End Phase. If it has a Level 1 "Purrely" monster as material, the opponent is unable to interrupt this effect. It can also inflict 1500 [[Burn Deck|burn]] damage when an attack is declared involving it while it has 5 or more materials, which can synergize with the effect of "[[Purrely Happy Memory]]" that can give "Expurrely Happiness" additional attacks on monsters per battle phase, and "[[Purrely Delicious Memory]]" that can give "Expurrely Happiness" a powerful stat boost and make an opponent's monster unable to be destroyed by battle, allowing both versions of "Happiness" to attack the same monster multiple times to repeatedly trigger their effects.

  "[[Purrelyeap!?]]" is a critical trap card that can target a "Purrely" Xyz Monster and then overlay a "Purrely" Xyz Monster of a different rank on top of it, allowing the deck to special summon an "[[Expurrely Noir]]" even when unable to set up a 5+ material Rank-2 "Purrely" Xyz. A common setup is to use the effect of "[[Epurrely Noir]]" to set [[Purrelyeap!?]] from deck, and then rank up "[[Epurrely Noir]]" to "[[Expurrely Noir]]" during the opponent's [[Standby Phase]]. Because "Purrelyeap!?" can be activated at trap speed, it can also be used to dodge destruction or targeted negation effects aimed at the vulnerable Rank-2 Xyz Monsters by ranking them up into an "Expurrely Noir" in response to a threat.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As most of the key "Purrely" Spell Cards are [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s, cards such as "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]" or "[[Diabellze the Original Sinkeeper]]" can be used to slow down the gameplan.
  * Since most of the "Purrely" Quick-Play Spell cards grant an Xyz monster that has it as a material an effect that will be activated during the opponent's Standby Phase, each "Purrely" Xyz monster is highly susceptible to "[[Kurikara Divincarnate]]" which can easily [[tribute]] all of the "Purrely" Xyz monsters to summon itself as a [[summoning condition]], completely bypassing their protection effect.
  ** Similarily, "[[Kaiju]]" monsters or other monsters such as "[[Lava Golem]]" can be used to remove a "Purrely" Xyz monster without a way to respond.
