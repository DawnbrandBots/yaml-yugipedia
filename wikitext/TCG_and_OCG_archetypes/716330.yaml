  "'''Purrely'''" (ピュアリィ ''Pyuaryi'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Fairy]] monsters with different attributes introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Amazing Defenders]]''/''[[Amazing Defenders]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 06: Purrely}}

  == Etymology ==
  "Purrely" may be a portmanteau of "pure", "purr" and "fairy" while also playing on the word "purely".

  == Design ==
  "Purrely" monsters are creatures with canine and feline traits, with the Xyz monsters depicting the growth of the [[Purrely (card)|namesake]] monster into advanced forms of various elements. The "Purrely" Quick-Play Spells appear to depict photos of "Purrely" taken by its unseen owner (revealed to be a young girl in its concept art).

  == Playing style ==
  "Purrely" is a theme focused on using the namesake Level 1 monster [[Purrely (card)|"Purrely"]] to reveal a "Purrely" [[Quick-Play Spell Card]] from your hand with its effect, then [[Special Summon]]ing a [[Rank]] 2 [[Xyz Monster]] which mentions that Quick-Play Spell in its text using "Purrely" and the revealed card as materials - from there, the objective is to stack further materials onto those Xyz Monsters through their effects. Each of the Rank 2 "Purrely" Xyz Monsters has a unique effect that gains a bonus effect if it has a specific "Purrely" Quick-Play Spell as a material; each one also shares an effect where, thrice per turn as a [[Quick Effect]], you can attach activated "Purrely" Quick-Play Spells to that monster as material with a bonus effect depending on the Rank 2 in question - this varies from temporary removal of cards on the field to changing battle positions.

  Their primary boss monster is [[Expurrely Happiness]], a Rank 7 Xyz Monster than can be Xyz Summoned using a Rank 2 Xyz Monster with 5 or more materials. "Expurrely Happiness" is a more aggressively focused monster in how it can negate the effects of all your opponent's monsters during your Main Phase and until the End Phase without being interrupted if it has a Level 1 "Purrely" monster as material as well as being able to inflict 1500 [[Burn Deck|burn]] damage when an attack is declared involving it while it has 5 or more materials. This is further helped by the 3 "Purrely" Quick-Play Spells granting bonus effects when used a material for a "Purrely" Xyz Monster; from multiple attacks to equipping more materials and even further stat gains.
