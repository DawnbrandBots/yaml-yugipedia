  "'''Number'''", known as "'''Numbers'''" (ナンバーズ ''Nanbāzu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Spell Cards|Spells]]/[[Trap Cards|Traps]] that support "[[Number]]" [[Xyz Monster]]s.

  == Trivia ==
  * While it has only one support card ("[[Astraltopia]]"), this archetype technically has the most members of any archetype, due to all "Number" Xyz Monsters ({{card name|Number|ja}} ''{{romanized name|Number|ja}}'') also being part of this archetype; however, the vast majority of the members are monsters, which are not directly supported by "Astraltopia", which specifically searches Spells and Traps.
  ** Excluding the 4 [[Boss Duel]]-only Tokens Summoned by "[[Don Thousand/Spell B]]", this archetype has a total of {{hardcoded query|{{#ask: [[Archseries::Number (Spell/Trap archetype)]] [[Concept:CG cards]] [[Belongs to::+]]|format=count}}}} members: {{hardcoded query|{{#ask: [[Archseries::Number]] [[Primary type::Xyz Monster]] [[Concept:CG monsters]]|format=count}}}} Xyz Monsters, "[[Numeral Hunter]]", and {{hardcoded query|{{#ask: [[Archseries::Number (Spell/Trap archetype)]] [[Concept:CG non-monster cards]]|format=count}}}} Spell/Trap Cards.
