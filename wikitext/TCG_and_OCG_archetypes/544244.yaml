  "'''The Weather'''" ({{Ruby|天|てん}}{{Ruby|気|き}} ''Tenki'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Fairy]] [[Monster Card|monsters]], introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Spirit Warriors]]''/''[[Spirit Warriors]]''. All of its [[Main Deck]] members are [[Level]] 3, except for the Level 6 "[[The Weather Painter Aurora]]".
  ==Lore==
  {{Main|Master Duel card storylines#The Fairies Who Paint the Weather}}
  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  "The Weather" monsters are designed after various weather phenomena, combined with elements of artist's routines such as drawing, painting, and coloring, with each monster wielding various tools associated with those aforementioned routines. Their respective "The Weather [...] Canvas" Spells/Traps depict each of them in the process of creating the effects of the weather they're associated with.
  Each Main Deck monster is also themed after one of the traditional colors of the rainbow, while "[[The Weather Painter Rainbow]]" is obviously linked to the rainbow in general.
  ===Etymology===
  "The Weather" cards are named after weather phenomenons. In the ''[[OCG]]'', each "The Weather Painter" monster has a given name related to either the color or the weather phenomenon they represent.

  ==Playing style==
  The archetype's main playing style revolves around using the "The Weather [...] Canvas" Continuous Spells/Traps to grant additional effects to the "The Weather" Main Deck monsters, according to their position on the Main Monster Zones. Those effects are activated by [[banish]]ing themselves, and if they do so, they can be Special Summoned back during the next Standby Phase. Most of their monsters also have the capability to place more "The Weather [...] Canvas" Spells/Traps on the field from various places. Because of this, careful consideration, planning ahead and advanced strategical moves are extremely important in order to maximize each of the card's output and adapt to almost every situation.
  All of the effects granted by their Spells/Traps are [[Quick Effect]]s, making them effectively able to dodge almost all targeting and destruction effects. "[[The Weather Painter Aurora]]", in turn, also protects their Spells/Traps from being targeted or destroyed, rendering almost any attempts of targeting and destroying them useless. This trait also makes them resistant against most common negation effects.
  Some of their monsters like "[[The Weather Painter Thunder]]" and "[[The Weather Painter Sun]]" can also use any Continuous Spell/Trap for their effects, thus they also have synergy with [[floodgate]] and [[lockdown]] cards like "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]", "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]", or "[[Skill Drain]]". "[[The Weather Painter Cloud]]" can also help recovering their Spell/Traps from the Graveyard, allowing them to use cards like "[[Magic Planter]]" and turn it into more advantage instead of an even trade.

  ===Weaknesses===
  Due to the reliance on banishing themselves as cost for their effects, "The Weather" Decks are vulnerable to cards like "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" or "[[Artifact Lancea]]". "[[Gozen Match]]" can also cripple their ability to Summon more monsters onto the field, forcing them to rely on just one monster to maintain their position.
  Despite their heavy reliance on banishing, they're also susceptible to banishment themselves. Mass-banishing effect of cards like those of "[[Arkbrave Dragon]]" is especially the most dangerous, rendering cards like "[[The Weather Painter Cloud]]" useless, with "[[The Weather Painter Aurora]]" unable to stop it. Banishing also put their monsters out of reach from "[[The Weather Sunny Canvas]]", while "[[The Weather Painter Sun]]" unable to revive himself.
  Much like other boss monsters in the game, cards like "[[Solemn Warning]]" and "[[Black Horn of Heaven]]" can stop the Summoning of "Rainbow", while the "[[Kaiju]]s" can effortlessly remove her from the field (assuming the Main Monster Zones aren't full).
  ==Trivia==
  * This archetype can be considered as an antithesis to the "[[Magical Musket]]" archetype, in many ways:
  ** "Magical Musket" focuses on using their [[Spell]]/[[Trap]]s to fuel their monster effects, while this archetype uses their monsters to fuel their Spell/Traps, instead.
  ** "Magical Musket" has 2 Spells and 4 Traps, while this archetype has 4 Spells and 2 Traps.
  ** "Magical Musket" monsters are all [[Fiend]], while "The Weather" monsters are all [[Fairy]].
  ** "[[Magical Musket Mastermind Zakiel]]" (the boss monster of the "Magical Musket" archetype) is a [[Main Deck]] monster, while "[[The Weather Painter Rainbow]]" (the boss monster of the "The Weather" archetype) is an [[Extra Deck]] monster.
  ** "[[Magical Musket - Fiendish Deal]]" protects "Magical Musket" monsters, while "[[The Weather Painter Aurora]]" protects this archetype's Spells/Traps.
  ** Both debuted in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Spirit Warriors]]'', and are [[column]]-based archetypes.
