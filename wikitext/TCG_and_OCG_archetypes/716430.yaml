  "'''Rescue-ACE'''" ({{Ruby|Ｒ－ＡＣＥ|レスキュー・エース}} ''Resukyū Ēsu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Warrior]] and [[Machine]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Amazing Defenders]]''/''[[Amazing Defenders]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 10: Rescue-ACE}}

  == Etymology ==
  The archtype's name "Rescue-ACE" is based on the [[wikipedia:List of firefighting mnemonics#First attack response|"R.A.C.E." firefighters safety procedure]], of which the card "[[RESCUE!]]", "[[ALERT!]]", "[[CONTAIN!]]", and "[[EXTINGUISH!]]" is a reference to these procedure.

  == Design ==
  [[File:Crest-RescueACE.png|thumb|left|100px|The "Rescue-ACE" crest.]]
  The archetype's design is based on the tokusatsu show ''[[wikipedia:Tomica Hero: Rescue Force|Tomica Hero: Rescue Force]]'', which features various [[wikipedia:Fire engine|fire engines]] and firefighters alike as the heroes saving people from disasters caused by evil forces using various special vehicles.

  ===Members===
  All "Rescue-ACE" monsters are Main Deck [[FIRE]] [[Machine]] or [[Warrior]] monsters. They can be broadly split into four sub-series based on their levels and effects:

  * "[[Rescue-ACE Turbulence|Turbulence]]" and "[[Rescue-ACE Preventer|Preventer]]": High-level Machines that can be summoned from the hand by banishing "Rescue-ACE" cards from GY.
  * "[[Rescue-ACE Fire Engine|Fire Engine]]" and "[[Rescue-ACE Fire Attacker|Fire Attacker]]": Medium-level Machines that can be summoned from the hand when another "Rescue-ACE" monster is summoned.
  * "[[Rescue-ACE Air Lifter|Air Lifter]]", "[[Rescue-ACE Monitor|Monitor]]", "[[Rescue-ACE Impulse|Impulse]]": Low-level Warriors that can [[Tribute]] themselves from the [[hand]]/field when the opponent activates an on-field [[monster effect]], and summon a Machine "Rescue-ACE" monsters from the hand/[[GY]]/[[Main Deck|Deck]]. "Air Lifter" and "Monitor" can also search "Rescue-ACE" Spells/Traps on summon.
  * "[[Rescue-ACE Hydrant]]": Low-level Machine who can search "Rescue-ACE" monsters.

  == Playing style ==
  "Rescue-ACE" is a largely [[Control|control-based]] archetype which revolves around the powerful and recursive effect of its boss monster "[[Rescue-ACE Turbulence]]". "Turbulence" can [[set]] up to 4 "Rescue-ACE" [[Quick-Play Spell]]s and/or [[Normal Trap]]s with different names directly from the Deck. Most other "Rescue-ACE" act as support to "Turbulence", providing it with utility, consistency, recovery, and/or additional swarming.

  To search out and summon "Turbulence", the Deck primarily relies on "[[Rescue-ACE Hydrant|Hydrant]]" and "[[EMERGENCY!]]", the latter of which can be searched by "[[Rescue-ACE Air Lifter|Air Lifter]]". "[[ALERT!]]" and "[[Rescue-ACE Impulse|Impulse]]" can also conditionally search out "Turbulence".

  The theme's Quick-Play Spell and Normal Trap cards are its main board presence, and provide a variety of effects, including recovery ("[[RESCUE!]]", "[[ALERT!]]"), negation ("[[CONTAIN!]]"), removal ("[[EXTINGUISH!]]"), protection ("[[REINFORCE!]]"), and follow-up ("[[EMERGENCY!]]"). Additionally, "[[RESCUE!]]" and "[[ALERT!]]" provide alternate effect options when the player controls "Hydrant", "[[CONTAIN!]]" and "[[EXTINGUISH!]]" grant bonus effects when the player controls "Hydrant", and "[[REINFORCE!]]" and "[[EMERGENCY!]]" can be banished from the GY to re-set "Rescue-ACE" Spells and Traps.

  The deck's final Spell, its Field Spell "[[Rescue-ACE HQ]]" (searchable only by "Air Lifter"), provides stat boosting, additional swarming, and recovery of GY/banished cards to complete the resource loop.

  As long as "Turbulence" is able to resolve its Set 4 effect, the deck can easily snowball into victory by setting up the player's board to survive the opponent's turn and enable another activation of "Turbulence" on the player's next turn, drowning out the opponent in card advantage. Additional searching and swarming power leftover after resolving "Turbulence" can be pivoted over to "[[Rescue-ACE Preventer]]", who provides an extra "[[Book of Moon]]" effect. Since the Deck imposes no [[xenolock]]ing whatsoever, extra swarming power can also be used to make [[Extra Deck]] boss monsters.

  Several external engines can provide the deck with additional consistency and extra combo potential:
  * The "[[Sinful Spoils]]"/"[[Diabellstar]]" engine can tutor out starter card "[[Rescue-ACE Hydrant|Hydrant]]" by searching "[[Original Sinful Spoils - Snake-Eye]]".
  * The "[[Superheavy Samurai Prodigy Wakaushi]]" engine can tutor out starter card "[[Rescue-ACE Air Lifter|Air Lifter]]" by making "[[Battlin' Boxer King Dempsey]]".

  ===Weaknesses===
  * The effect of "Rescue-ACE Turbulence" is critical to resolve, so negating it with a card like "[[Infinite Impermanence]]" can be devastating. However, "Turbulence" can be protected from targeted negates with cards like "[[EMERGENCY!]]" and "[[S:P Little Knight]]".
  * Mass Spell/Trap removal, such as "[[Harpie's Feather Duster]]" and "[[Evenly Matched]]", is particularly effective, as the Deck has no in-archetype way to negate Spells/Traps or to protect their backrow. This can be mitigated through [[Extra Deck]] cards like "[[Fiendsmith's Desirae]]", though.
