  "'''Regenesis'''" (リジェネシス ''Rijeneshisu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[monster]]s with 2500 [[original ATK and DEF]] introduced in ''[[Alliance Insight]]''.

  == Design ==
  "Regenesis" monsters seems to be godlike incarnations of popular kinds of creatures and characters from the fantasy genre (warriors, dragons, etc.) in the same way as [[wikipedia:Avatara|avatars]], and there is also exactly one member for each existing [[Attribute]] (except for [[DIVINE]]). All of them having four arms is another element inspired by [[wikipedia:Hinduism|Hinduism]], specifically by the [[wikipedia:Hinduism|Chaturbhuja]], a concept in which such iconography is regarded to symbolise divinity and power. On the other hand, each member is named after a book in the [[wikipedia:Torah|Torah]], which is the compilation of the first five books of the [[wikipedia:Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Bible]]. This mix between different religions might be itself a reference to [[wikipedia:Omnism|omnism]], which is the belief that God is actually the same entity in all religions, just interpreted in different ways. Finally, for each pair of each [[Level]] (7, 8, and 10) there is a male member and female member, which might be a reference to [[wikipedia:Adam and Eve|Adam and Eve]], who were respectively the first man and woman, according to the creation myth of the [[wikipedia:Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic religions]].

  == Trivia ==
  * This archetype's boss monsters, "Lord" and "Overlord", specifically being Level 10 might be a double reference: to the trend of making godlike [[Monster Card]]s Level 10 as the [[Egyptian God]]s, as well as to the number 10 symbolising perfection and completeness in [[wikipedia:Dante Alighieri|Dante Alighieri]]'s [[wikipedia:Divine Comedy|Divine Comedy]].
