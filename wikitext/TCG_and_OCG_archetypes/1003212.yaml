  "'''Centur-Ion'''", spelled "'''Centurion'''" (センチュリオン ''Senchurion'') in Asia, is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Valiant Smashers]]''.

  This archetype is supported by the related "[[Emblema]]" archetype.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#No. 05: Centur-Ion}}

  == Etymology ==
  The name of the theme likely derives from those of real-life Roman centurions, or commanders of a group of 100 men known as a "century". Each monster has the "Centurion" katakana applied over its individual kanji name, which denotes its "rank" within the theme.

  == Design ==
  <div style="float:right">[[File:Crest-Centurion.png|thumb|left|100px|The "Centur-Ion" crest.]]</div>
  The archetype's design seems to be inspired from various examples of mecha in media, such as anime produced by [[wikipedia:Gainax|Gainax]] and its successor [[wikipedia:Studio Trigger|Studio Trigger]]. In particular ''[[wikipedia:Gunbuster|Gunbuster]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann|Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann]]'', and ''[[wikipedia:Darling in the Franxx|Darling in the Franxx]]''. It also seems to reference SD Mecha series, particularly Haō Taikei Ryū Knight, as well as the ''[[wikipedia:Sakura Wars|Sakura Wars]]'' series of games.

  == Playing style ==
  "Centur-Ion" is a midrange [[Synchro]] theme focused on placing monsters in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] as [[Continuous Trap Card]]s and quickly [[Synchro Summon]]ing various [[Level]] 8 and 12 [[Synchro Monster]]s, and recurring resources through in-archetype cards. Every [[Main Deck]] monster can [[Special Summon]] themselves while placed as a Continuous Trap; since they are Trap cards, they can be summoned on the opponent's turn. By using "[[Stand Up Centur-Ion!]]", the archetype's [[Field Spell]], these monsters can immediately be used for a Synchro Summon.

  The Deck's main starter and Tuner is "[[Centur-Ion Primera|Primera]]", which searches any "Centur-Ion" on Summon, and protects higher Level monsters if in the backrow. "[[Centur-Ion Trudea|Trudea]]", "[[Stand Up Centur-Ion!]]", and ""[[Emblema Oath]]" can each place a "Centur-Ion" from Deck into the backrow, acting as consistency. Various archetypal cards, such as "Truedea", "[[Centur-Ion Gargoyle II|Gargoyle II]]" and "[[Wake Up Centur-Ion!]]", act as ways to get extra Level 4/8 monsters while generating advantage. "[[Centur-Ion Atrii|Atrii]]" acts as a secondary Tuner that can treat itself as a non-Tuner with a potential Draw 1.

  "[[Centur-Ion Phalanx]]" (banishes 1 monster, then can revive a Synchro but it loses 1500 ATK) and "[[Centur-Ion True Awakening]]" (omni-negate, sending one face-up monster in the Spell/Trap Zone as cost) are archetypal Trap cards, helping create interactions without Summoning too much (playing around cards like "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" and the "[[Mulcharmy]]" monsters).

  The main Synchros this Deck summons are:
  * "[[Centur-Ion Primera Primus]]" is a Level 8 Tuner Synchro which can search or dump an "Emblema" card, can destroy cards on the field, and can Summon itself from the GY if a "Centur-Ion" Synchro leaves the field.
  * "[[Centur-Ion Auxila]]", which protects face-up Spells/Traps from destruction, searches a "Centur-Ion card, and places a monster from GY/banishment as a Continuous Trap in the End Phase.
  * "[[Centur-Ion Legatia]]", which protects monsters at/below 2000 ATK from battle, can draw a card and destroy the highest ATK opposing monster on Summon, and places a monster from GY/hand as a Continuous Trap in the End Phase.
  * "[[Crimson Dragon (card)|Crimson Dragon]]", which, if you already have a Synchro monster on field, can be used to summon hard-to-summon Synchros like "[[Cosmic Blazar Dragon]]".
  * "[[Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity]]" (Traditional Format only), which prevents your opponent from activating effects the turn it is Summoned, essentially acting as a turn skip when combined with "Crimson Dragon".

  The "[[Bystial]]" monsters work well with this Deck, giving it access to Level 10 Synchros like "[[Bystial Dis Pater]]", "[[Chaos Angel]]", and "[[Baronne de Fleur]]" (''[[OCG]]'' only) while acting as disruption against LIGHT/DARK Decks - including being able to trigger the Synchro effect of "Stand Up Centur-Ion!". If the opponent isn't playing LIGHT/DARK monsters, the Bystials can still be Summoned by banishing "Primera" (placing it as a Continuous Trap using "Auxila").

  The archetype can also be used as an engine; any deck that can make Level 12 Synchros can access "Auxila", which searches a "Centur-Ion" card to start a combo.

  === Sample combos ===
  One of the Deck's most important plays is a 1.5-card combo to Synchro Summon a Level 12 monster during the opponent's turn, the most notable of these is "[[Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity]]" which can shut down nearly all of their plays. Since "King Calamity's" ban in the ''TCG''/''OCG'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel|Master Duel]]'', other Level 12 monsters like "[[Cosmic Blazar Dragon]]" are used instead.
  {{Combo steps
  | opening = "[[Stand Up Centur-Ion!]]" + 1 card
  | end     = "[[Centur-Ion Legatia]]" + 1 draw + "[[Centur-Ion Trudea]]" in S/T Zone + (during opponent's turn) any Level 12 Synchro Monster that can be Synchro Summoned
  | steps   = 
  # Activate "[[Stand Up Centur-Ion!]]" by sending 1 card the GY to place "[[Centur-Ion Primera]]" from the Deck in the Spell & Trap Zone
  # Activate "Primera" to Summon itself and add "[[Centur-Ion Trudea]]" to the hand
  # Normal Summon "Trudea"
  # Activate "Trudea" to place itself and "[[Centur-Ion Emeth VI]]" from the Deck in the Spell & Trap Zone
  # Activate "Emet VI" to Summon itself
  # Synchro Summon "[[Centur-Ion Legatia]]" by using "Primera" and "Emet VI"
  # Activate "Legatia" to draw 1 card
  # During the End Phase, activate "Legatia" to place "Primera" from the GY in the Spell & Trap Zone
  # During the opponent's Main Phase 1, activate "Trudea" and "Primera" to Summon themselves from the Spell & Trap Zone
  # Activate "Emet VI" to Summon itself from the GY by placing "Trudea" in the Spell & Trap Zone
  # Activate "Stand Up Centur-Ion!" to Synchro Summon "[[Crimson Dragon (card)|Crimson Dragon]]" by using "Primera" and "Emet VI"
  # Activate "Crimson Dragon" by targeting Legatia to return itself to the Extra Deck and Summon a Level 12 Synchro Monster from the Extra Deck
