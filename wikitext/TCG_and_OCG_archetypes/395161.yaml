  "'''Dracoverlord'''" ({{Ruby|竜|りゅう}}{{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|王|おう}} ''Ryūmaō'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Dragon]] [[Pendulum Monster]]s. While the monsters debuted in ''[[Dimension of Chaos]]'', it was not until ''[[Breakers of Shadow]]'' that they received [[support]]. The archetype is thematically, and gameplay-wise, related to the "[[Dracoslayer]]" and "[[Amorphage]]" archetypes.

  == Lore ==
  "[[Vector Pendulum, the Dracoverlord]]" conquered an entire world using his army of Dracofiends, doing so with Dragon Alchemy to convert all life into [[Amorphage|his terrible minions]]. At some point after this, "[[Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer]]" lost all of his memories and was cursed to have powers similar to the Dracofiends. Believing Dragon Alchemy to hold the key to breaking his curse and unlocking his memories, the Dracoslayer continued his journey and resolved to fight the evils of the Dracoverlord. Eventually, "Luster Pendulum" gained power from his comrades and transformed into "[[Master Pendulum, the Dracoslayer]]". After turning into this form, Master went to the Dracoverlord's castle to battle him. Lector summons his strongest dragons to challenge Master Pendulum. Master defeats it and before the Draco's battle, Vector uses the remains of his fallen dragon to transform himself into [[Lector Pendulum, the Dracoverlord]].
