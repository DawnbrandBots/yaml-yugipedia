  "'''Number C10X'''" ({{Ruby|Ｃ|カオス}}{{Ruby|Ｎｏ．|ナンバーズ}}１０Ｘ ''Kaosu Nanbāzu Hyaku''), read as "'''Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers'''" in the Japanese version and as "'''Chaos Number Over One Hundred'''" or "'''Chaos Number Over a Hundred'''" in the dub, is a sub-[[archetype]] to the "[[Number]]", "[[Number C]]" and "[[Number 10X]]" archetypes used by the [[Seven Barian Emperors]] of the [[Barian World]] as their [[signature card]]s.

  == Background ==
  In the anime, the majority of them were first Summoned through [[Rank-Up]] by using "[[Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force (later anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force]]" on their corresponding "Number 10X" base form. After [[Nash]] and [[Marin]] had their memories restored, the Barian Emperors gained the ability to use "[[Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One]]", allowing them to easily Summon their ace cards directly from the [[Extra Deck]] or [[Graveyard]]. Most [[Monster Card|monsters]] in this archetype have effects that inflict a lot of [[damage]] and/or [[negate]] their opponent's [[card effect|effects]], and in the anime, were commonly seen being used to negate protection effects such as that of Yuma's "[[Number 39: Utopia (anime)|Number 39: Utopia]]", Vector's "[[Number 43: Manipulator of Souls (anime)|Number 43: Manipulator of Souls]]" and Kite's "[[Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon (anime)|Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon]]". Any of the monsters in the archetype can be combined together to [[Xyz Summon]] "[[CXyz Barian Hope (anime)|CXyz Barian Hope]]".
  The first support card explicitly for this sub-archetype was "[[Chaos Caller]]". Like "Number 10X", this archetype's name is somewhat unusual in that the exact string "C10X" does not actually appear in any of its members' names. Instead, the text of anime support cards use the clause "X is any number between 1 and 7", 「Ｘは１～７の任意の数値」. On the ''OCG''/''TCG'' version of "[[CXyz Barian Hope]]", the card text instead uses the phrase "a monster with "Number C101" through "Number C107" in its name", 「「ＣＮｏ．１０１」～「ＣＮｏ．１０７」のいずれかの「ＣＮｏ．」モンスター」.
  Common among all "[[C (archetype)|C]]" monsters of Barian origin, each "Number C10X" monster appears to have a red aura-like energy coursing through their body. All "Number C10X" monsters, except "[[Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade]]", have the same [[Attribute]]s as their base forms.

  == Members ==
  === Original ===
  Seven "Number C10X" monsters exist. All of them were passed to [[Reginald Kastle|Nash]] at the end of the [[Barian Emperor Onslaught]].

  === Combination ===
  During his final [[Duel]] against [[Yuma Tsukumo|Yuma]] and [[Astral]], [[Reginald Kastle|Nash]] combined the powers of all [[Seven Barian Emperors]], creating the ultimate [[Barian]] monster, "[[CXyz Barian Hope (anime)|CXyz Barian Hope]]".

  == Weaknesses ==
  Like the "[[Number C]]" [[Monster Card|monsters]], "Number C10X" monsters cannot use some of their [[card effect|effects]] unless their base forms are [[attach]]ed to them as [[Xyz Material|Overlay Unit]], or in the case of "[[Number C101: Silent Honor DARK (anime)|Silent Honor DARK]]" and "[[Number C103: Ragnafinity (anime)|Ragnafinity]]", in the [[Graveyard]].
