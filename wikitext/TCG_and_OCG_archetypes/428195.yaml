  "'''Battlewasp'''", known as "'''Bee Force'''" ({{Ruby|Ｂ・Ｆ|ビー・フォース}} ''Bī Fōsu'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[WIND]] [[Insect]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Shinji Weber]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime.

  == Etymology ==
  The Japanese name of the archetype, "Bee Force" ({{Ruby|Ｂ・Ｆ|ビー・フォース}}) is similar to the Japanese name of the "[[Blackwing]]" archetype, "Black Feather" ({{Ruby|ＢＦ|ブラックフェザー}} ''Burakku Fezā''), which emphasizes the friendship between Shinji and [[Crow Hogan (ARC-V)|Crow Hogan]]. Likewise, the English names of both archetypes have the initials "BW".

  Individually, the [[Level 2]] or lower monsters are based on ranged projectiles, such as needles, pins, and darts, while the [[Level 3]] or higher monsters are based on piercing weapons, such as the [[wikipedia:Halberd|halberd]] and ranged weapons including [[wikipedia:Arbalest|arbalests]] and [[wikipedia:Ballista|ballistae]].

  == Playing style ==
  The "Battlewasp" archetype tends to focus on very typical [[Insect]] [[swarm]]ing tactics to perform quick [[Synchro Summon]]s and overwhelm the opponent with [[ATK]]/[[DEF]]-decreasing and [[burn]] effects. Furthermore, they seem to revolve around "numbers" - the more "Battlewasp" monsters you gather, the stronger their effects become, reflecting Shinji's mentality of union.

  "[[Battlewasp - Sting the Poison|Sting the Poison]]" begins the [[Deck]]'s strategy by adding a "Battlewasp" to [[hand]] from the Deck, while also carrying a [[Quick Effect]] that [[negate]]s the effects of an opponent's monster. "[[Battlewasp - Twinbow the Attacker|Twinbow the Attacker]]" [[Special Summon]]s itself from the hand and can attack twice. "[[Battlewasp - Arbalest the Rapidfire|Arbalest the Rapidfire]]" has the highest ATK of the [[Main Deck]] "Battlewasp" monsters, Special Summons a [[Level 3]] or lower Insect monster from the [[Graveyard]] when it is [[Normal Summon]]ed, and Special Summons another "Battlewasp" from the Deck when it is destroyed by an opponent's card. "[[Battlewasp - Pin the Bullseye|Pin the Bulleye]]" Special Summons itself while another Insect is on the player's [[field]] and inflicts 200 damage for each "Pin the Bullseye" the player controls. "[[Battlewasp - Dart the Hunter|Dart the Hunter]]" inflicts the full ATK of the opponent's monster [[destroyed by battle]] by a "Battlewasp" monster, and treats another Insect monster, except itself, as a [[Tuner monster]].

  The [[Synchro Monsters]] consists of the [[Tuner Synchro Monster]], "[[Battlewasp - Azusa the Ghost Bow|Azusa the Ghost Bow]]", which inflicts more damage when the opponent takes [[effect damage]] from another "Battlewasp" monster and Special Summons itself from the Graveyard if a "Battlewasp" monster destroys an opponent's monster in battle. "[[Battlewasp - Halberd the Charge|Halberd the Charge]]" halves the ATK of an opponent's monster with equal or higher ATK and inflicts 200 damage to the opponent for each "Battlewasp" monster the opponent controls. "[[Battlewasp - Hama the Conquering Bow|Hama the Conquering Bow]]" could serve as the Deck's endgame by attacking twice when it Synchro Summoned using a Synchro Monster as [[material]], reduces an opponent's monster's ATK/DEF by 1000 after inflicting [[battle damage]], and inflict 300 damage to the opponent for each "Battlwasp" the player controls if they do not inflict battle damage. "[[Battlewasp - Ballista the Armageddon|Ballista the Armageddon]]" serves as the archetype's boss monster, being a [[Level 12]] Synchro Monster, which [[banish]]es all Insect monsters from the Graveyard and makes the opponent's monster lost 500 ATK/DEF for each banished monster, inflicts [[piercing]] damage, and Special Summons three of the player's banished [[Level 11]] or lower Insect monsters.

  "[[Revival Swarm]]" can Special Summon a "Battlewasp" monster from the Graveyard, and can be banished to provide proactive protection for an Insect monster. "[[Summoning Swarm]]" can Special Summon any number of "Battlewasp" monsters up to the number of an opponent's monsters the control, but is restricted to [[Level 4]] or lower monsters, preventing the player from Summoning the "Battlewasp" Synchro Monsters from the Graveyard. "[[Battlewasp - Nest]]" can [[activate]] when a "Battlewasp" monster is [[target]]ed for an attack, which can Special Summon a "Battlewasp" from the Deck to end the [[Battle Phase]], but it can only be used twice before it is [[destroy]]ed.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Being Synchro-based, this Deck loses to "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" and other cards that prevent or punish Synchro Summoning.
  * Being Type-centered, this Deck loses to cards like "[[Zombie World]]" and "[[There Can Be Only One]]".
