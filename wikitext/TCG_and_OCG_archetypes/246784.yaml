  == Playing style ==
  The "Battlin' Boxer" archetype focuses on Battle Phase advantage and disrupting the opponent via the "[[Battlin' Boxing]]" counter trap card. The deck achieves this mainly by swarming the field as fast as possible to Xyz Summon their Extra Deck monsters.

  The 2 main consistency monsters of the deck are "[[Battlin' Boxer Uppercutter]]" and "[[Battlin' Boxer Promoter]]". Promoter can quickly swarm the field by tributing itself to summon 2 "Battlin' Boxer" and can banish itself to modulate their levels, while Uppercutter helps search "counter" trap cards when it's summoned or sent to the GY via your card effects.

  Some extenders of the deck that these monsters can bring out or search for are: "[[Battlin' Boxer Chief Second]]", "[[Battlin' Boxer Glassjaw]]", "[[Battlin' Boxer Shadow]]" and "[[Battlin' Boxer Sparrer]]", all which helps swarm the field or recover it.

  The deck also host 4 different hand traps in which 2 can be used in the GY via banishing which could be setup by "[[Battlin' Boxer Headgeared]]" with two of the most notable one being "[[Battlin' Boxer Counterpunch]]" and "[[Battlin' Boxer Chief Second]]".

  The Extra deck has a variety of effects ranging from setting up disruptions with "[[Battlin' Boxer King Dempsey]]" and "[[Number C79: Battlin' Boxer General Kaiser]]" or dealing effect damage via battle with "[[Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus]]" and "[[Number C105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus]]". A good bridge between these two styles is "[[Number 79: Battlin' Boxer Nova Kaiser]]" who can provide main deck Xyz Material for "[[Number 105: Battlin' Boxer Star Cestus]]" and extra body for summoning "[[Number C105: Battlin' Boxer Comet Cestus]]" and "[[Number C79: Battlin' Boxer General Kaiser]]" via level modulation from "[[Battlin' Boxer Promoter]]" or a rank-up magic card for the extra effect.

  Perhaps one of the most unique aspects of the archetype is its ability to search out trap cards with "counter" in it's name by making the use of "[[Flamvell Counter]]". Other options include "[[Battlin' Boxing Cross Counter]]" and "[[Jolt Counter]]".
