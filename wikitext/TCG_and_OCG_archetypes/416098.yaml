  }}
  "'''Skyscraper'''" ({{Ruby|摩|ま}}{{Ruby|天|てん}}{{Ruby|楼|ろう}} ''Matenrō'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Field Spell Card]]s used by [[Jaden Yuki]], and acts as support to the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype. It is a sub-archetype of the [[anime-only]] "[[Sky]]" archetype and it is not a sub-archetype of the "[[Scrap]]" archetype, as its Japanese name does not contain 「スクラップ」.

  Members have existed since ''[[Cybernetic Revolution]]'', but the archetype did not receive support until ''[[20th Anniversary Pack 1st Wave]]'' in the ''OCG'' and ''[[Duelist Saga]]'' in the ''TCG''.
