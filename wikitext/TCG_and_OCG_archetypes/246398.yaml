  "'''Duston'''" (ダストン ''Dasuton'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]] 1 [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with the appearance of dust particles that was first introduced in ''[[Abyss Rising]]''. All monsters of this archetype have 0 [[ATK]] and 1000 [[DEF]], except for the [[?]] ATK and DEF "[[Starduston]]".

  == Playstyle ==
  Their playstyle revolves around using "[[House Duston]]" to [[Special Summon]] members of the archetype to either side of the field, ideally ones with negative effects to your opponent's side of the field and ones with positive and/or no effects to your own side of the field. This reflects how dust can spread in real life. The [[Attribute]]s of "Dustons" are diverse, therefore "[[Fuh-Rin-Ka-Zan]]" can be used to gain easy advantage after swarming the field with "House Duston". "[[DNA Checkup]]" is also a valid option if it is played at the right time.
  4 of the 5 colored "Dustons" (Red, Green, Yellow, & Blue) share almost all of their effects with each other. Except for the one that activates when they are destroyed, the shared effects are:
  * Cannot be used as a [[Fusion Material|Fusion]], [[Synchro Material|Synchro]], or [[Xyz Material]] for their respective [[Special Summon]]ing mechanics.
  * While this card is face-up on the field, it cannot be [[Tribute]]d.
  * You can only control 1 face-up "[corresponding "Duston]". (A player can only control one of each colored "Duston".)
  As an endgame strategy, Dustons use their [[swarm]]ing to set up the powerful "[[Starduston]]" while avoiding any negative effects, as "Starduston" does not destroy or Tribute monsters when it is Summoned.

  === Goblin King OTK ===
  The following Deck uses the effect of "[[House Duston]]" to summon 4 "Dustons" to each side of the field to increase the ATK of "[[Goblin King]]" to 8000, then attack an opponent's face-up attack position "Duston" for an OTK.
  "Starduston" can have up to 5000 ATK, but it can also lock the opponent if used with "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  "Dustons" are very weak against decks that heavily use [[Link Monster]]s, as there is nothing preventing them being used as Link Material. A "Duston" player trying to set up their strategy will simply give their opponent free Link Material if something prevents them from bringing out "Starduston".

  == Trivia ==
  * This archetype has a lot in common with the "[[Ojama]]" archetype.
  ** All of the monsters have 0 [[ATK]] and 1000 [[DEF]] except "Starduston".
  ** Both share similar art styles and designs (mono-chromatic, cartoonish, etc).
  ** Both their play styles revolve around attempting to clog up the opponent's side of the field or rendering their [[Monster Zone]]s unusable.
