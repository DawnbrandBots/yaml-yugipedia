  "'''Duston'''" (ダストン ''Dasuton'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]] 1 [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with the appearance of dust particles that was first introduced in ''[[Abyss Rising]]''. All monsters of this archetype have 0 [[ATK]] and 1000 [[DEF]], except for the [[?]] ATK and DEF "[[Starduston]]".

  == Playstyle ==
  Their playstyle revolves around using "[[House Duston]]" to [[Special Summon]] members of the archetype to both sides of the field, ideally ones with negative effects to your opponent's side.

  Four of the five colored "Dustons" (Red, Green, Yellow, & Blue) share the following effects:
  * Cannot be Tributed if face-up, and cannot be used as a [[Fusion Material|Fusion]], [[Synchro Material|Synchro]], or [[Xyz Material]].
  * When destroyed, the controller is inflicted with a negative effect.
  * You can only control 1 face-up "[card name]". (A player can only control one of each colored "Duston".)

  Any remaining "Dustons" on your field can be sent to the GY to Special Summon the powerful "[[Starduston]]", avoiding their negative effects.

  The [[Attribute]]s of "Dustons" are diverse, therefore "[[Fuh-Rin-Ka-Zan]]" can be used to gain easy advantage after swarming the field with "House Duston". "[[DNA Checkup]]" is another valid option if it is played at the right time. Also, since "House Duston" and "White Duston" are [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]]s, they benefit from "[[Fiendsmith]]" cards.

  === Goblin King OTK ===
  The following Deck uses the effect of "[[House Duston]]" to summon 4 "Dustons" to each side of the field to increase the ATK of "[[Goblin King]]" to 8000, then attack an opponent's face-up attack position "Duston" for an OTK.
  "Starduston" can have up to 5000 ATK, but it can also lock the opponent if used with "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * "Dustons" are very weak against decks that use [[Link Monster]]s, as there is nothing preventing them being used as Link Material. A "Duston" player trying to set up their strategy will simply give their opponent free Link Material if something prevents them from bringing out "Starduston".
  * "House Duston" and "Starduston" both require sending to the GY, so GY floodgates like "[[Macro Cosmos]]" and "[[Dimension Shifter]]" shuts down the strategy.
  * The 5 Colored "Dustons" do nothing in hand, hurting the consistency of the strategy.

  == Trivia ==
  * This archetype has a lot in common with the "[[Ojama]]" archetype.
  ** All of the monsters have 0 [[ATK]] and 1000 [[DEF]] except "Starduston".
  ** Both share similar art styles and designs (mono-chromatic, cartoonish, etc).
  ** Both their play styles revolve around attempting to clog up the opponent's side of the field or rendering their [[Monster Zone]]s unusable.
  * An unknown orange "Duston" appears in the artwork of "[[Two-for-One Team]]".
