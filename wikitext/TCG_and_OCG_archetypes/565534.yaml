  "'''Danger!'''", named "'''Lands Unknown'''" ({{Ruby|未|み}}{{Ruby|界|かい}}{{Ruby|域|いき}} ''Mikaiiki'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] monsters of various [[Type]]s that debuted in ''[[Cybernetic Horizon]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Master Duel card storylines#The Danger Files}}

  == Design ==
  The members of the "Danger!" archetype are based on various [[wikipedia:List of cryptids|cryptids]], mysterious animals of questionable origins that are believed to exist somewhere in the world.
  The "Danger!" monsters inhabit an unexplored island called "Umaria", shown in "[[Realm of Danger!]]". The artworks of various "Danger!" cards depict expedition teams of human explorers interacting with this new land and its inhabitants.

  === Members ===
  The ''TCG'' names of the [[Level]] 3 "Danger!" monsters modify their archetypal name with "Danger!?", and their individual names replace the exclamation marks (!) with question marks (?). This is likely due to their relatively harmless appearances clashing with the undertone of urgency from the regular naming scheme. Such a distinction does not exist in their ''OCG'' names.

  == Playing style ==
  All "Danger!" monsters share two effects:
  # ''You can reveal this card in your hand; your opponent randomly chooses 1 card from your entire hand, then you discard the chosen card. Then, if the discarded card was not [its own name], Special Summon 1 [its own name] from your hand, and if you do, draw 1 card.'' (non-once per turn)
  # ''If this card is discarded: You can [Trigger Effect].'' ([[only once per turn]])

  |-

  | [[Danger! Ogopogo!|Ogopogo]] || Send 1 "Danger!" card from Deck to GY, except "Ogopogo".
  |-
  ! rowspan=3 | Offensive
  | [[Danger! Dogman!|Dogman]] || Have all opposing face-up monsters lose 1000 ATK this turn.
  |-
  | [[Danger! Bigfoot!|Bigfoot]] || Target 1 opposing face-up card; destroy it.
  |-
  | [[Danger! Thunderbird!|Thunderbird]] || Target 1 opposing Set card; destroy it.
  |}
  These shared effects simulates "Danger!" monsters revealing themselves in the wilderness (i.e.: in their owner's hand), going back into "hiding", and prompting the opponent try to "catch" the monsters (i.e.: correctly discarding the monster from the hand).
  Though "Danger!" monster effects are fundamentally luck-based, activating a "Danger!" monster effect rarely incurs a card disadvantage (though they do slowly reduce the player's hand size, making it easier to "catch" a "Danger!" monster). "Danger!" monsters can easily swarm the field between their "monster catching" and discard swarming effects, and provide materials for Extra Deck plays.
  The "Danger!" archetype synergizes especially well with archetypes that benefit from being discarded, such as the "[[Dark World]]" and "[[Fabled]]" monsters.

  === 8-Axis ===
  {{See also|Horus}}
  Due to the swarming and drawing potential of "Danger!" monsters, some monsters of the archetype has seen some experimentation with various decks. Though an [[Xyz Summon|Xyz]]-oriented builds, known as "8-Axis", has seen a considerable success in various tournaments.

  8-Axis is a deck with the simple goal of summoning various easy-to-summon [[Level 8 Monster Cards|Level 8]] monsters to use them to summon [[Rank 8 Monster Cards|Rank 8]] [[Xyz Monster]]s as their main interaction. Due to the large number of generic Rank 8 monsters, the deck has an access to various cards depending on situation, from negation effect such as "[[Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy]]" to OTK enabler using "[[Number 97: Draglubion]]" to summon "[[Number 100: Numeron Dragon]]".

  The deck has several variants often combined with other themes with easy-to-summon Level 8 monsters, such as "[[Blue-Eyes]]" and "[[Galaxy]]", though a common build during 2020s often uses "[[Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher]]", which [[banish]] 7 cards from the Deck to summon itself as one of the key cards. This mass banish effect were often exploited by using a combination of "[[Pot of Desires]]" and "[[Gren Maju Da Eiza]]" to help in powering up "Gren Maju" to use it as a normal summonable beatstick as a secondary plan. Alternatively, other builds uses various "[[Horus]]" monsters, which can easily swarm the field by filling the [[Graveyard]] and bring themselves out by their own effects when any monsters (including "Danger!" monsters through their own discard effect) were sent to the GY. Because of this versatility, the deck were often used as a blind going second option in a similar vein to the [[Train]] decks.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As their effects work only in the hand or in the Graveyard, they're weak to commonly-used cards such as "[[Abyss Dweller]]", the often Side-Decked card "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]", and less-seen cards like "[[Debunk]]" or "[[Skull Meister]]". In the same way, the archetype is vulnerable to cards like "[[Macro Cosmos]]" and "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", that banish their monsters.
  * Because the monsters have to reveal themselves in the hand, cards like "[[Ceremonial Bell]]" and "[[Respect Play]]" can seriously disrupt this Deck's strategy, because they simply reveal the monsters so their owner can no longer reveal them by their own effect.
  * Because the Deck revolves around Special Summoning, cards such as "[[Vanity's Fiend]]" and "[[Vanity's Ruler]]" can also impede the Deck by preventing you from Special Summoning.
  * The Deck is, to some extent, luck-based. If the random card discarded by the opponent is not a "Danger!" monster, this can hamper the Deck's overall consistency; however, this can be alleviated by including "[[Dark World]]" and/or "[[Fabled]]" monsters in the Deck. Also, losing a [[Hand trap]] could be a problem, so the Deck cannot rely on them as consistently as other strategies.
