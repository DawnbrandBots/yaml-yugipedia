  "'''Shark Drake'''" (シャーク・ドレイク ''Shāku Doreiku'') is an archetype of [[WATER]] monsters and a sub-[[archetype]] to the "[[Shark (archetype)|Shark]]" archetype. It debuted in ''[[Galactic Overlord]]'' with the release of "[[Number 32: Shark Drake]]"; however, it did not receive specific support until ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]''.

  == Design ==
  The monsters are "[[Number 32: Shark Drake]]" and its "[[Number C]]" forms. Unlike most "Shark" monsters, these are [[Sea Serpent]] monsters instead of [[Fish]] monsters.

  == Playing style ==
  {{Main|Shark (archetype)#Playing style}}
  "Shark Drake" monsters are [[Xyz Monsters]] that use their materials to reduce the [[ATK]] of opposing monsters, and often conduct additional battles against them.
