  "'''Butterspy'''", known as "'''Phantom Butterfly Assassin'''" ({{Ruby|幻|げん}}{{Ruby|蝶|ちょう}}の{{Ruby|刺|し}}{{Ruby|客|きゃく}} ''Genchō no Shikyaku'' or 환접의 자객 ''Hwanjeob-ui Jagaeg'') in Japan or Korea, is an [[archetype]] used by [[Dextra]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime. So far, all the members of this archetype are [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] despite their [[Insect]] appearances.

  == Playing style ==
  The Deck’s playing style consists of using many strategies to manipulate and weaken enemy's monsters, mainly by changing their [[Battle Position]]s and decreasing the opponent's [[Monster Card|monsters]] stats as well as keeping your [[Life Points]] safe and maintaining field control by activating spells and traps to change the battle position either on your/opponent's turn. Another way in keeping your Life Points safe would be through [[Special Summon]]ing monsters from your Deck when one is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.
  With "[[Moonlit Papillon]]" being the main searcher of the Deck, you are able to Special Summon any type of "Butterspy" monster from your Deck. "[[Morpho Butterspy]]" has its effect only activate when a monster's battle position is changed to either [[Attack Position]] or [[Defense Position]] which allows you to target that monster thus having it lose 1000 ATK or DEF which would come in very handy by activating  "[[Enemy Controller]]", "[[Butterflyoke]]" and many other battle changing cards. That would give you the upper hand against monsters with high attack or defense. Also protecting your Life Points. With "[[Swallowtail Butterspy]]", you can target a monster on the field and lower its attack depending on how many Life Points you have inflicted on your opponent. To get full use of her effect, you can play "[[Infected Mail]]" which would be proven useful. But its only an option. "[[Blue Mountain Butterspy]]" serves as a "[[Kagetokage]]" for the theme, helping it to Xyz quickly into the needed Xyz Monster like "[[Photon Papilloperative]]" and "[[Photon Alexandra Queen]]".
