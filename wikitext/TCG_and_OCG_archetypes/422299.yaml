  '''"Gandora"''' (ガンドラ ''Gandora'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]] 8 [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] with 0 [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] used by [[Yugi Muto]], which consists of the original "[[Gandora the Dragon of Destruction]]" and its [[Card evolutions|retrains]].

  Members have existed since [[The Valuable Book 8 promotional cards|''The Valuable Book 8'' promotional cards]], but didn't receive support until the [[V Jump February 2017 promotional card|''V Jump February 2017'' promotional card]].

  == Playstyle ==
  All "Gandora" monsters have a [[nuke|nuking]] effect followed by an [[ATK]] gain, and the downside of [[Halves LP|halving]] the player's own [[LP]]. Due to lacking in-archetype searching, summoning, or utility-based support, "Gandora" does not form a themed strategy by itself. Instead, they can be played as generic boss monsters for Decks that can tutor them, such as [[Dragon Link]]. The [[Shining Sarcophagus (series)|Shining Sarcophagus]] series specifically uses "[[Gandora-G the Dragon of Destruction|Gandora-G]]" as an in-theme boss monster.
