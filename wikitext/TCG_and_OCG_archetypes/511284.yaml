  "'''Crystal Beast'''", known as "'''Gem Beast'''" ({{Ruby|宝玉獣|ほうぎょくじゅう}} ''Hōgyokujū'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of monsters based on gemstones and animals. They are used by [[Jesse Anderson]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. "[[Ultimate Crystal]]" monsters serve as their boss monsters, and they are supported by the "[[Crystal]]" and "[[Rainbow Bridge (archetype)|Rainbow Bridge]]" Spell/Trap Cards. It also contains the "[[Advanced Crystal Beast]]" sub-archetype used by Jesse Anderson while he was possessed by [[Yubel (character)|Yubel]], which features [[dark counterpart]]s of the 7 main "Crystal Beasts".

  There are seven main Crystal Beasts, each representing a different gemstone and animal. Their boss monster, "[[Rainbow Dragon]]", requires 7 different "Crystal Beast" monsters in order to be Summoned. In addition to the 7 main "Crystal Beasts", there is an eighth "Crystal Beast", "[[Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon]]", which is based on "Rainbow Dragon" rather than any specific gemstone.

  All "Crystal Beasts" share an effect to become a [[Continuous Spell Card]] when destroyed in a [[Monster Zone]]. Many of their support cards revolve around this effect.

  == Design ==
  The "Crystal Beasts", whose original name is "Gem Beasts", as their name says, are all animals which have each a different kind of gem in their bodies. Their different gems' colors form the seven colors of the [[wikipedia:Rainbow|rainbow]], reflecting the name and design of their ace, "[[Rainbow Dragon]]". Their nomenclature is "Crystal Beast (gem) (animal)", and their [[attack name]]s are "[gem] [body part/attack]".

  The [[Advanced Crystal Beast]]s have almost the same attack names as their standard counterparts, but with the addition of "Dark" between the gem and the attack/body part.

  == Playing style ==
  "Crystal Beast" Decks revolve around placing "Crystal Beast" monsters in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] as [[Continuous Spell Card]]s to enable a variety of effects. Many of their powerful Spell and Trap support cards rely on having many "Crystal Beast" cards in the Spell & Trap Zone, such as "[[Ancient City - Rainbow Ruins]]", and "[[Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle]]" can Summon them to fill the field.

  The archetype has many cards to help put their monsters in the Spell & Trap Zone, most notably "[[Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus]]" and "[[Crystal Bond]]" each placing a "Crystal Beast" monster from the Deck in the Spell & Trap Zone, and "[[Golden Rule]]" placing 2 such cards while Special Summoning a monster. Notably, "Crystal Bond" can search "Sapphire Pegasus", and subsequently Normal Summoning it will fulfill the conditions for "[[Crystal Beacon]]", which can Special Summon "Ruby Carbuncle" from the Deck, triggering its effect and resulting in 4 monsters on the field. Likewise, "Golden Rule" can place 2 copies of "Sapphire Pegasus", Special Summon a "Ruby Carbuncle" from the hand or GY, then Special Summon the 2 copies of "Sapphire Pegasus". While most "Crystal Beast" monsters have no effects in the Spell & Trap Zone, "[[Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon]]" can Special Summon a monster from the Deck and add 1 "[[Ultimate Crystal]]" monster from the Deck by banishing itself while it's a Continuous Spell, making it an ideal card to place in the Spell & Trap Zone with these cards as it helps facilitate a Rank 4 Xyz Summon if placed by "Sapphire Pegasus".

  Usually, the Deck's primary goal is to gather enough "Crystal Beast" monsters to Summon a powerful "Ultimate Crystal" monster. Once 7 "Crystal Beast" monsters with different names have been gathered, a player can Special Summon "[[Rainbow Dragon]]", Tribute it to Special Summon "[[Rainbow Overdragon]]", then banish "Rainbow Dragon" and the 7 "Crystal Beasts" to Special Summon "[[Ultimate Crystal Rainbow Dragon Overdrive]]" with 11,000 ATK. "Overdrive's" effect to clear the entire field as a Quick Effect and Special Summon a horde of "Crystal Beast" monsters makes it a powerful boardbreaker, disruptor and OTK enabler. "[[Ultimate Crystal Magic]]" can also advance this goal by quickly Fusion Summoning "Overdragon".

  In addition to their primary goal in Summoning "Ultimate Crystal" monsters, the Deck also has many powerful disruption effects. "[[Ancient City - Rainbow Ruins]]" or "[[Crystal Miracle]]" can negate the activation of Spell/Trap Cards (the latter also being able to negate the activations of monster effects), while "[[Crystal Conclave]]" or "[[Rainbow Bridge of the Heart]]" can return a card from each player's field to the hand. "[[Crystal Abundance]]" can also act as a surprise blowout card by clearing the field and swarming the field for an OTK.

  The archetype's swarming capabilities can also help facilitate a large variety of powerful [[Xyz Summon]]s and [[Link Summon]]s. Since "Sapphire Pegasus" and "[[Crystal Beast Cobalt Eagle|Cobalt Eagle]]" are [[WIND]] monsters, they can be used to Xyz Summon "[[Lightning Chidori]]". Furthermore, the archetype primarily consisting of [[Beast]] and [[Winged Beast]] monsters leads to synergies with "[[Tri-Brigade]]" cards, with "[[Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen]]" searching a Beast or Winged Beast when it is sent to the GY. "Ruby Carbuncle", "Emerald Tortoise" and "Amethyst Cat" being Level 3 monsters allows them to be used with "[[Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss]]", easily sending these 3 "Crystal Beast" monsters to the GY for the Summon of "Rainbow Dragon" (or send "[[Crystal Master]]" in order to Special Summon later). Finally, the lack of once-per-turn clauses on the effects of both "Sapphire Pegasus" and "Ruby Carbuncle" make them prime targets for the effects of "[[Cross-Sheep]]" (when Summoning either of the 2 "Ultimate Crystal" Fusion Monsters), "[[Number 60: Dugares the Timeless]]" and "[[Worldsea Dragon Zealantis]]" that can Special Summon either of the duo several times.

  The primary drawback to the archetype is its reliance on having 7 different "Crystal Beast" names in order to Summon an "Ultimate Crystal" monster, since besides the aforementioned "Sapphire Pegasus", "Ruby Carbuncle" and "Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon", many of the other members of the archetype have mediocre, outdated effects, with only "Cobalt Eagle" having a niche use at best due to its ability to recycle a "Sapphire Pegasus". As a result, these Decks are often forced to play these suboptimal "Crystal Beasts" in order to work efficiently, even if only at 1 copy each. Thankfully, the myriad of options to place them directly in the Spell & Trap Zone from the Deck can prevent them from becoming [[dead draw]]s. Alternatively, an "[[Advanced Crystal Beast]]" variant can substitute the original "[[Crystal Beast Amber Mammoth|Amber Mammoth]]", "[[Crystal Beast Amethyst Cat|Amethyst Cat]]", "[[Crystal Beast Topaz Tiger|Topaz Tiger]]" and "[[Crystal Beast Emerald Tortoise|Emerald Tortoise]]" with the "Advanced Crystal Beast" versions of "[[Advanced Crystal Beast Sapphire Pegasus|Sapphire Pegasus]]", "[[Advanced Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle|Ruby Carbuncle]]", and "[[Advanced Crystal Beast Cobalt Eagle|Cobalt Eagle]]" to achieve the requisite 7 names at the cost of the three's reliance on "[[Advanced Dark]]" to stay on the field as monsters.

  Since the interactions with Monster Cards as Continuous Spells are not always obvious to recognize, here are some helpful tips regarding the issue:
  * "Crystal Beast" support cards such as "Crystal Beacon" only require "Crystal Beast" cards in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]], not Continuous Spells specifically, so they can be used even if they're treated as [[Equip Card]]s from an effect like "[[Destiny HERO - Plasma]]" or even as [[Continuous Trap Card]]s by the effect of "[[Psychic Megacyber]]".
  * If a card such as "[[Macro Cosmos]]" is preventing cards from reaching the [[Graveyard]], this will NOT prevent "Crystal Beasts" from using their effects to place themselves in the Spell & Trap Zone, as they would never hit the Graveyard in the first place.
  * While "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" is active, "Crystal Beasts" in the Spell & Trap Zones that are removed from the field by cards like "[[Rare Value]]" or "[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]" will be sent to the Graveyard, not [[banish]]ed (as they left the field as Spells or Traps).

  === Techs ===
  * Since "[[Rainbow Bridge of Salvation]]" can search any [[Field Spell Card]], the following cards have some synergy with the Deck:
  ** "[[Duel Academy (card)|Duel Academy]]" has a few utility effects. Many "Crystal Beast" monsters are [[Beast]], enabling its first effect to destroy a card after one of the archetype's disruptive Traps resolves, and "Ruby Carbuncle" is [[Fairy]], enabling its third effect to give monsters a permanent ATK boost.
  ** "[[Dragon Ravine]]" can send "Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon" to the GY to help fulfill the Summoning condition for "Ultimate Crystal" monsters.
  ** "[[Mound of the Bound Creator]]" can help protect "Ultimate Crystal" monsters.
  ** "[[Nightmare Throne]]" can access "[[Phantom of Yubel]]" for its "pseudo-monster negate" Quick Effect; by destroying "[[Spirit of Yubel]]" to Special Summon "[[Yubel]]" and then simply Normal Summoning "Sapphire Pegasus" (then trigger its effect), both "Yubel" and "Sapphire Pegasus" can be Linked off for "[[Cross-Sheep]]". From there, "Phantom of Yubel" can be Special Summoned (by shuffling "Spirit of Yubel" and "Yubel" in the GY) to a zone "Cross-Sheep" points to, thus proccing said Link Monster's effect to Special Summon "Sapphire Pegasus" from the GY and triggering its effect once more.
  ** "[[Pressured Planet Wraitsoth]]" can search "[[Kashtira Fenrir]]", which in addition to being generically useful due to its banish effect, searches "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]" to enable the Xyz Summon of "[[Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack]]", whose Tokens can be used to Link Summon "[[Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss]]" to send "Ruby Carbuncle" to the GY for use with "Golden Rule". ("Riseheart" must be Normal Summoned in this case, since its Special Summon effect will prevent the player from Link Summoning.)
  ** "[[Vaylantz World - Shinra Bansho]]" can act as an additional Special Summon of a "Crystal Beast" monster in the Spell & Trap Zone.
  ** "[[Kyoutou Waterfront]]" can amass a bevy of [[Kaiju Counter]]s with which to enable the search and omni-negation effect of "[[Gameciel, the Sea Turtle Kaiju]]" to protect the archetype's board. Its Summon is enabled by "[[Saryuja Skull Dread]]'s" effect, afterwards able to be used as material for "[[Worldsea Dragon Zealantis]]" to "reset" the archetype's non-once-per-turn monster effects.
  ** "[[Dragonic Diagram]]" can destroy a "Crystal Beast" (potentially allowing it to become a Continuous Spell in the process) to search "[[Master Peace, the True Dracoverlord]]", which can both use any "Crystal Beast" monsters in the Spell/Trap Zone as [[Tribute Summon]] fodder and take the player's regular [[Normal Summon]] given "[[Rainbow Bridge of the Heart]]" allows the Deck an additional archetypal Normal Summon.
  * "[[Noble Knight's Shield-Bearer]]" is able to search either version of "Sapphire Pegasus" and is itself searchable by "[[Reinforcement of the Army]]"" and "[[Heritage of the Chalice]]". It can also search "[[Dynatherium]]" as an extra level 4 WIND monster, or "[[Hop Ear Squadron]]", which can Synchro Summon "[[Vulcan the Divine]]" during the opponents turn as a disruptive play. "Heritage of the Chalice" can also search [["Infernoble Arms - Hauteclere"]] which can quickly OTK the opponent if equipped to any of the deck's boss monsters or "[[Rainbow Neos]]".
  * "[[Nemeses]]" monsters Special Summon themselves by returning banished monsters (such as "Crystal Beast Rainbow Dragon" after using its Continuous Spell effect, any "Crystal Beast" or "Ultimate Crystal" monster after Summoning "Ultimate Crystal Rainbow Dragon Overdrive" or Link Summoning "[[S:P Little Knight]]") to the Deck while offering extra bodies to perform Extra Deck Summons with. Since "Crystal Beast" decks can easily make a Rank 4 Xyz Monster, they can Xyz Summon "[[Infernal Flame Banshee]]", which can search "[[Nemeses Flag]]", then Special Summon itself and use its effect to add another "Nemeses" monster. While having another banished monster, the second "Nemeses" monster searched by "Flag" can then be Special Summoned. Among the other "Nemeses" monsters, "[[Nemeses Corridor]]" is the most useful since it is also a Level 4 WIND monster for "Lightning Chidori" and a [[Thunder]] monster which can be used for "[[Thunder Dragon Colossus]]". Alternatively, "[[Archnemeses Eschatos]]" or "[[Archnemeses Protos]]" can be added, then Summoned to then use its effect to hinder the opponent from Special Summoning monsters of a certain Type or Attribute respectively.
  ** "[[Snake-Eye]]" is another archetype that utilizes monsters as Continuous Spells, which can also be searched by "Banshee". "[[Snake-Eyes Poplar]]" and "[[Divine Temple of the Snake-Eye]]" can enable "[[Snake-Eyes Diabellstar]]", a Spellcaster monster that can be used to [[Contact Fusion]] "[[Magistus Chorozo]]", not only enabling the revival effect of "[[Cross-Sheep]]" but also acting as a [[Tuner]] for toolbox Synchro Summons. Beyond that, "[[Snake-Eyes Doomed Dragon]]" can be Summoned using any 2 Monster Cards in the Spell & Trap Zones, enabling "Cross-Sheep" in much of the same fashion.
  * "[[Revolution Synchron]]" can turn a Level 4 monster such as "Pegasus" into a Level 7 [[Dragon]] [[Synchro Monster]] from hand, extending the use of a plain Normal Summon, then revive itself as a Level 1 Tuner, allowing it to be used alongside that Level 7 Synchro Monster for a Synchro Summon of a Level 8 monster such as "[[Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon]]".
  ** "[[Power Tool Dragon]]" can search "[[Golden Rule]]" provided all three copies are in the Deck, allowing the search effects of "[[Rainbow Bridge]]" or "[[Rainbow Bridge of the Heart]]" to be reserved for other archetypal Spells/Traps.
  ** "[[Ancient Fairy Dragon]]" can not only Summon a Level 4 or lower monster from hand (enabling both "Pegasus" and "Carbuncle"), but also destroy an expended [[Field Spell]] (such as "Divine Temple of the Snake-Eye") to search others, such as "Kyoutou Waterfront" for the aforementioned "Gameciel" synergy.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Cards like "[[Banisher of the Light]]", "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]" can prevent "[[Rainbow Dragon]]" from being Summoned by preventing "Crystal Beasts" from entering the GY.
  ** Similarly, moving "Crystal Beast" monsters (especially "[[Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle]]") out of the GY with "[[D.D. Crow]]" or "[[Bystial]]" monsters in response to "[[Golden Rule]]", "[[Cross-Sheep]]" or "[[Number 60: Dugares the Timeless]]" can hinder their strategies significantly.

  == Trivia ==
  * In the English dub of the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, the "Crystal Beast" monsters (barring "[[Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle (anime)|Ruby Carbuncle]]"), when [[Summon]]ed by [[Jesse Anderson]], are able to speak like a human, each imitating the voice of a real-life film actor.
