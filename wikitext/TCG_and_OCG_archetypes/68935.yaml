  "'''Fossil'''" ({{Ruby|化|か}}{{Ruby|石|せき}} ''Kaseki'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Rock]] [[Fusion Monster]]s. It was used by [[Jim Crocodile Cook]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime.
  A number of older cards, such as "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Fossil Tusker]]", and "[[Living Fossil]]", include "Fossil" in their English names but are not part of this archetype, as their Japanese names do not contain {{Ruby|化|か}}{{Ruby|石|せき}}. Some other older cards, such as "[[Release from Stone]]", do not include "Fossil" in their English names but are part of this archetype, as their Japanese names do contain {{Ruby|化|か}}{{Ruby|石|せき}}. However, because ''TCG'' and ''OCG'' support for this archetype only works on Fusion Monsters, this is not an issue.
  The "Fossil" archetype was a candidate to be released in ''[[Collection Pack 2020]]'', via a poll.<ref name="ygorgpoll">{{cite web | url = https://ygorganization.com/12themesenter1manleaves/ | title = <nowiki>[OCG] Vote for a Theme in Collection Pack 2020</nowiki> | author = NeoArkadia | website= The Organization | date = January 10, 2020 | accessdate = May 23, 2022}}</ref><ref name="poll">{{cite web |title=新春特別企画 COLLECTION PACK 2020 キャラクターテーマカード OCG化投票!! |url=https://www.yugioh-card.com/japan/notice/information/?40 |website=遊戯王OCG デュエルモンスターズ |accessdate=18 January 2020 |language=ja |date=10 January 2020}}</ref> The archetype came in first place, with 27.4% of the total votes.<ref name="twitterresult">{{cite web |author1=【公式】遊戯王OCG |title=【キャラクターテーマカード OCG化投票】結果発表見事1位に選ばれたのは・・・『ジム・クロコダイル・クックのフォッシルカード』OCG化決定ですたくさんの投票ありがとうございましたpic.twitter.com/cHpatp1AFX |url=https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1218140913467305986 |website=Twitter |accessdate=18 January 2020 |language=ja |date=17 January 2020}}</ref><ref name="ygorgresult">{{cite web | url = https://ygorganization.com/buycrocodiles/ | title = Collection Pack 2020 Poll Final Results | author = Ness | website = The Organization | date = January 17, 2020 | accessdate = May 23, 2022}}</ref>
  == Design ==
  In the Japanese version, the "Fossil" Fusion Monsters each include the [[wikipedia:Era (geology)|geologic era]] from which they originate in their names. In the anime and some video games, "[[Time Stream (anime)|Time Stream]]" supports "Fossil" Fusion Monsters based on the era in their name. The "[[Cenozoic]]" monsters are all Level 4 monsters that require a Level 4 or lower monster as material; the "[[Mesozoic]]" monsters are all Level 6 monsters that require Level 5 or 6 monsters as material; the "[[Paleozoic (anime)|Paleozoic]]" monsters are all Level 8 monsters that require Level 7 or higher monsters as material.
  The [[Fusion Material]]s of the "Fossil" Fusion Monsters, and hence mechanics of the Deck, is different in the various media the cards appear in.
  * In the anime, the Rock [[Monster Card|monster]] must be banished from the player's [[Graveyard]] while the other monster must be banished from the opponent's Graveyard and have a specific type.
  * In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Tag Force|Tag Force]]'' games, the Graveyard and Level requirements are the same as the anime, but they do not require the monster from the opponent's Graveyard to be of a specific Type.
  * In the ''OCG''/''TCG'' the materials were simplified again: The Fossil Dragons all require monsters with particular Levels from the opponent's Graveyard, the Fossil Machines all require Rock monsters from the player's Graveyard, and the Fossil Warriors do not restrict the materials to either player's Graveyard.

  == Playing style ==
  The Fusion Monsters all can only be Summoned by the effect of "[[Fossil Fusion]]", which [[banish]]es monsters in both Graveyards as [[Fusion Material]]. The Fusion Monsters all require a Rock monster and a monster of a particular Level to be used as material.
