  "'''Elemental Lord'''", known as "'''Spirit God'''" ({{Ruby|霊|れい}}{{Ruby|神|しん}} ''Reishin'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]] 8 [[Nomi]] [[Effect Monster]]s with 2800 [[ATK]] and 2200 [[DEF]]. They were initially a [[series]] until ''[[Flames of Destruction]]'', where they received support from the "[[Elementsaber]]" archetype.

  There is one "Elemental Lord" of each [[Attribute]], except [[DIVINE]]. Each of their Attributes coincides with the main Attribute theme of the pack they were released in.
  The "Elemental Lords" all have the appearance of mystical armor possessed by a specific elemental spirit. They each have multiple lightning strikes in the background of their artwork.

  == Playing style ==
  {{Main|Elementsaber#Playing style}}

  Each of the "Elemental Lords" shares the following effects:
  * Must be Special Summoned (from the hand) by having exactly 5 [corresponding [[Attribute]]] [[Monster Card|monster]]s in your [[Graveyard|GY]].
  * On Special Summon, activate [a unique effect]. Each monster's effect replicates a powerful card that is/was [[Forbidden]] at some point in the game's history.<ref name="Confirmed by Konami">[https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=4602 http://yugiohblog.konami.com] Konami's Article on Pyrorex</ref>
  * If this face-up card [[leaves the field]], skip the [[Battle Phase]] of your next turn.

  They can be played as support in their respective Attribute Decks - such as "[[Grandsoil the Elemental Lord]]" previously being played in EARTH-heavy "Grandsoil Psychic" Decks, or "[[Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord]]" being played in "[[Mermail]]" / "[[Atlantean]]" Decks (and searchable through "[[Atlantean Dragoons]]"). They can also be played within "Elementsaber".
