  "'''Elemental Lord'''", known as "'''Spirit God'''" ({{Ruby|霊|れい}}{{Ruby|神|しん}} ''Reishin'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Level]] 8 [[Nomi]] [[Effect Monster]]s with 2800 [[ATK]] and 2200 [[DEF]]. They were initially a [[series]] until ''[[Flames of Destruction]]'', where they received support from the "[[Elementsaber]]" archetype.
  There is one "Elemental Lord" of each [[Attribute]], except [[DIVINE]]. Each of their Attributes coincides with the main Attribute theme of the pack they were released in.
  The "Elemental Lords" all have the appearance of mystical armor possessed by a specific elemental spirit. They each have multiple lightning strikes in the background of their artwork.
  The "Elemental Lords" have several parts of their card text in common:
  * Their [[Summoning condition]]: "''Cannot be [[Normal Summon]]ed/[[Set]]. Must be [[Special Summon]]ed (from your [[hand]]) by having exactly 5 [corresponding [[Attribute]]] [[Monster Card|monster]]s in your [[Graveyard|GY]].''"
  * An effect the applies upon leaving the field: "If this face-up card [[leaves the field]], skip the [[Battle Phase]] of your next turn."
  * A [[Trigger Effect]] that activates when it is [[Special Summon]]ed. Each "Elemental Lord" has a different Trigger Effect, and that effect can [[only once per turn|only be used once per turn]]. Their Trigger Effects mirror the effects of powerful cards from the game's past that are or were [[Forbidden]] at some point.<ref name="Confirmed by Konami">[https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=4602 http://yugiohblog.konami.com] Konami's Article on Pyrorex</ref>
