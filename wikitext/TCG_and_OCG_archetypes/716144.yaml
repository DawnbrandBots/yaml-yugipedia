  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines#No. 03: P.U.N.K.|The Valuable Book EX 5 card storylines#No. 7: P.U.N.K. JAM FEVER!}}

  == Etymology ==
  The archetype's name is based on the [[wikipedia:Punk visual art|punk visual art]], an art movement and genre heavily rooted from the punk subculture. The genre is notable for its usage of shock value and strong, sometimes contrarian messages to instill feelings of rebellion, independence, nonconformity, and courage to do what the public expect the artists and enjoyers not to do.

  == Design ==
  The "P.U.N.K." cards are divided into five sub-series; four based on various genres of Japanese art, and one based on jam sessions with card artworks that depict impromptu collabs between the four different art genres. Each of the four visual art-based series has a [[Level]] 3 [[EARTH]] [[Psychic]] [[Tuner monster]] that requires the player to pay 600 [[LP]] to activate effects related to the other members of each of their respective series.

  == Playing style ==
  "P.U.N.K." is an archetype primarily made up of [[Level]] 3 [[Psychic]] [[Tuner monster]]s that revolve around a cost of 600 [[LP]]s to activate various effects, as well as [[Quick Effect]]s during the opponent's turn. These LP effects range from [[add]]ing the archetype's Monster, [[Spell]], and [[Trap Card]]s to the [[hand]], to being able to [[Fusion Summon]] or [[Synchro Summon]]. The [[Deck]] is also made up of Level 8 monsters of various [[Type]]s and [[Attribute]]s to assist in Summoning their boss monster; the Level 11 [[Synchro Monster]] "[[Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon]]", which has an effect to [[return]] a number of cards from the opponent's field to the hand based on how many Level 3 Psychic monsters with different names the player controls or are in their [[Graveyard]].

  "P.U.N.K." Spells and Traps include [[Continuous Spell Card]]s that give a passive benefit on the field and a form of protection when destroyed by an opponent's card effect, the [[Field Spell]] "[[P.U.N.K. JAM Extreme Session]]" that offers extension capabilities, and [[Normal Trap Card]]s that have effects such as negating the effects of a monster on the field for the rest of the turn or destroying a [[face down]] card on the field, which are improved by controlling a "P.U.N.K." monster, gaining LP based on the negated monster's original [[ATK]] or popping a face-up card respectively.

  One possible starting play uses "[[Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Sharakusai]]" and any 2 "P.U.N.K." monsters. "Sharakusai" can use the other 2 "P.U.N.K." monsters Fusion Summon "[[Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Rising Carp]]", which can then [[Tribute]] itself to [[Special Summon]] "[[Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin]]" and either "[[Gagaku-P.U.N.K. Wa Gon]]" or "[[Joruri-P.U.N.K. Madame Spider]]" from the [[Deck]]. "Ze Amin" will add "[[Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune]]", while "Wa Gon" or "Madame Spider" will add a "P.U.N.K." Spell/Trap. Next, "Foxy Tune" can Special Summon itself by Tributing "Wa Gon" or "Madame Spider", then be used along with "Ze Amin" to Synchro Summon "Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon". The effect of "Ze Amin" will increase its ATK to 3600, while "Amazing Dragon" can Special Summon "Rising Carp" back from the [[GY]]. During the opponent's turn, the player can use the other effect of "Sharakusai" to Synchro Summon a second "Amazing Dragon" using "Sharakusai" and "Rising Carp", which will [[return]] at least 3 of the opponent's cards to the hand, while also having the Spell/Trap searched by "Wa Gon" or "Madame Spider" to back it up.
