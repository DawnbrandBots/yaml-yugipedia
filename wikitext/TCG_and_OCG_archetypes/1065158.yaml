  "'''Primite'''" ({{Ruby|原|げん}}{{Ruby|石|せき}} ''Genseki'', lit. "'''Ore'''") is an archetype of [[Normal Monster]] support cards introduced in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]''.

  It is closely related to the [[Gem Dragon]] [[series]], as evidenced by the appearance of "[[Alexandrite Dragon]]" in one of its [[Spell Card]]s.

  ==Playing style==
  This archetype can be virtually played as an engine in any Deck focused around one or more [[Normal Monster]]s, and it is extremely consistent in doing that thanks to its search/recovery abilities. However, being composed entirely by [[Dragon]] monsters, it probably shines the most in tandem with Dragon [[archetype]]/series, like the one it is related to.
