  "'''Primite'''" ({{Ruby|原|げん}}{{Ruby|石|せき}} ''Genseki'', lit. "'''Ore'''") is an archetype of [[EARTH]] [[Attribute]] [[Dragon]] [[Type]] [[Monster Card|monster]]s focused on supporting [[Normal Monster]]s and introduced in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]''.

  It appears to be related to the [[Gem Dragon]] [[series]], as evidenced by the similar aesthetic, the gameplay synergy, and the appearance of a baby "[[Alexandrite Dragon]]" in the artwork of "[[Primite Roar]]".

  ==Playing style==
  As a theme, "Primite" focuses on supporting [[Normal Monster]]s; "Primite" cards can summon any desired [[Normal Monster]] from the Deck, and can provide powerful interruptions in the presence of Normal Monsters.

  "Primite" is primarily used as an [[List of unofficial terms|engine]] in Decks where it acts as an [[List of unofficial terms|extender]] (like "[[Blue-Eyes]]" and "[[Red-Eyes]]") or even a [[List of unofficial terms|starter]] (like "[[Sunavalon]]"), though it can also function on its own as a Control Deck. Its main strength is being able to set one or multiple [[List of unofficial terms|interruptions]] under a very few number of Summons, playing into cards like "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being|Nibiru]]" and the "[[Mulcharmy]]" monsters minimally, if not at all.

  * "[[Primite Howl]]" and "[[Primite Roar]]", if you control no monsters, can Special Summon a Normal Monster. Then, they can banish themselves from the GY to act as removal or interruption. However, those effects can only affect monsters with a higher or lower ATK, respectively, than a Normal Monster on field/GY.
  * "[[Primite Drillbeam]]" and "[[Primite Scream]]" are interruption that can recycle themselves - indefinitely or once, respectively. "Scream" requires controlling a Normal Monster or a Level 5+ "Primite" monster to activate. "Drillbeam" can also be activated that way, or by revealing a Normal Monster or any "Primite Card" in hand.
  * "[[Primite Imperial Dragon]]", the lynchpin of the theme, can [[banish]] any opponent's monster that matches the [[Type]] OR [[Attribute]] of Normal Monsters in the player's [[Graveyard]], requiring careful selection of which monsters to put in the Deck.
  * Finally, "[[Primite Dragon Ether Beryl]]" and "[[Primite Lordly Lode]]" are the consistency cards, the former recycling itself indefinitely but requiring your [[Normal Summon]], which is not a problem thanks to the latter being able to virtually [[Special Summon]] a monster every turn.

  "Lordly Lode" imposes the Deck's main xenolock; the player cannot activate the effects of their Special Summoned monsters on the field for the rest of the turn after resolving its summon from Deck effect.

  "Primite" can also be mixed with "[[Fiendsmith]]" to form a powerful control deck, bridging the two archetypes through the Normal [[LIGHT]] [[Fiend]] monsters "[[Dipity]]" or "[[White Duston]]", and Normal [[Level 6 Monster Cards|Level 6]] Fiends such as "[[Summoned Skull]]".

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Due to the archetypal [[List of unofficial terms|extenders]], "[[Primite Lordly Lode]]", "[[Primite Roar]]" and "[[Primite Howl]]", requiring [[Declares a card name|declaring]] a card's name, this theme is extremely vulnerable to "[[Engraver of the Mark]]".
  ** "[[Primite Dragon Ether Beryl]]" can partially make up for this by being able to give access to [[Normal Monsters]] without declaring their names, but it needs to be paired with cards that can retrieve said monsters from the [[Graveyard]].
