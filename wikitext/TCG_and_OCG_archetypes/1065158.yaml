  "'''Primite'''" ({{Ruby|原|げん}}{{Ruby|石|せき}} ''Genseki'', lit. "'''Ore'''") is an archetype focused on supporting [[Normal Monster]]s and introduced in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]''.

  It appears to be related to the [[Gem Dragon]] [[series]], as evidenced by the similar aesthetic, the gameplay synergy, and the appearance of a baby "[[Alexandrite Dragon]]" in the artwork of "[[Primite Roar]]".

  ==Members==
  The only two archetypal monsters released so far follows and confirms a mirroring scheme started by the [[Gem Dragon]]s.

  "[[Hyozanryu]]" differs from the rest for its [[Level]] and for sharing its [[Attribute]] with a non-matching member, but it can be paired with "[[Carboneddon]] as they are linked by the latter's effect and the sum of their Levels make 10 like the other pairs.

  ==Playing style==
  "Primite", in addition to being able to search Normal Monsters with extreme consistency, an asset for decks that use them as a starter like "[[Sunavalon]]", functions on its own as a control deck, getting multiple disruptions under a very few number of summons, playing into cards like the "[[Mulcharmy]]" cards minimally, if at all.

  "[[Primite Howl]]" and "[[Primite Roar]]" give disruption in addition to summoning a Normal Monster, but the former targets monsters with higher ATK, while the latter targets monsters with lower ATK, which makes picking an optimal target extremely dependant on other decks you expect to play against. "[[Primite Drillbeam]]" and "[[Primite Resounding Reaction]]" are reusable interruption (the former also being removal going second and indefinitely recyclable, instead of just once).

  Much like "Howl" and "Roar", "[[Primite Imperial Dragon]]", the lynchpin of the archetype, requires careful selection of normal monsters in order to optimize its effectiveness, banishing any opponent's monster that matches the [[Type]] OR [[Attribute]] of Normal Monsters in your graveyard.

  "[[Primite Another Beryl]]" and "[[Primite Lordly Lode]]" are the primary consistency cards, the former recycling itself indefinitely, but requiring your Normal Summon.
