  "'''Primite'''" ({{Ruby|原|げん}}{{Ruby|石|せき}} ''Genseki'', lit. "'''Ore'''") is an archetype focused on supporting [[Normal Monster]]s and introduced in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]''.

  It appears to be related to the [[Gem Dragon]] [[series]], as evidenced by the similar aesthetic, the gameplay synergy, and the appearance of a baby "[[Alexandrite Dragon]]" in the artwork of "[[Primite Roar]]".

  ==Playing style==
  Being able to search for [[Normal Monster]]s with extreme consistency, "Primite" is primarily used as an [[List of unofficial terms|engine]] in Decks where it acts as an [[List of unofficial terms|extender]] (like "[[Blue-Eyes]]" and "[[Red-Eyes]]") or even a [[List of unofficial terms|starter]] (like "[[Sunavalon]]"). However, it can also function on its own as a control Deck able to set  multiple [[List of unofficial terms|interruptions]] under a very few number of Summons, playing into cards like "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being|Nibiru]]" and the "[[Mulcharmy]]" monsters minimally, if not at all.

  "[[Primite Howl]]" and "[[Primite Roar]]" give disruption in addition to Summoning a Normal Monster, but they target monsters with a higher ATK and a lower ATK respectively, which makes picking an optimal Normal Monster extremely dependant on the Decks you expect to play against. "[[Primite Drillbeam]]" and "[[Primite Resounding Reaction]]" are instead only interruptions, but they can recycle themselves indefinitely and just once respectively.

  Much like "Howl" and "Roar", "[[Primite Imperial Dragon]]", the lynchpin of the theme, requires careful selection of Normal Monsters in order to optimize its effectiveness, as it can [[banish]] any opponent's monster that matches the [[Type]] OR [[Attribute]] of Normal Monsters in the player's [[Graveyard]]. Finally, "[[Primite Another Beryl]]" and "[[Primite Lordly Lode]]" are the consistency cards, the former recycling itself indefinitely but requiring your [[Normal Summon]], which is not a problem thanks to the latter being able to virtually [[Special Summon]] a monster every turn.
