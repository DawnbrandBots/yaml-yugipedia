  "'''Primite'''" ({{Ruby|原|げん}}{{Ruby|石|せき}} ''Genseki'', lit. "'''Ore'''") is an archetype of [[EARTH]] [[Attribute]] [[Dragon]] [[Type]] [[Monster Card|monster]]s focused on supporting [[Normal Monster]]s and introduced in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]''.

  It appears to be related to the [[Gem Dragon]] [[series]], as evidenced by the similar aesthetic, the gameplay synergy, and the appearance of a baby "[[Alexandrite Dragon]]" in the artwork of "[[Primite Roar]]".

  ==Playing style==
  "Primite", able to search for [[Normal Monster]]s with extreme consistency, is primarily used as an [[List of unofficial terms|engine]] in Decks where it acts as an [[List of unofficial terms|extender]] (like "[[Blue-Eyes]]" and "[[Red-Eyes]]") or even a [[List of unofficial terms|starter]] (like "[[Sunavalon]]"). It can also function in Decks that would otherwise wouldn't use Normal Monsters (at the cost of a brick), or even on its own. Its main strength is being able to set one or multiple [[List of unofficial terms|interruptions]] under a very few number of Summons, playing into cards like "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being|Nibiru]]" and the "[[Mulcharmy]]" monsters minimally, if not at all.

  * "[[Primite Howl]]" and "[[Primite Roar]]" can remove an opposing monster on your opponent's turn. However, they only target monsters with a higher or lower ATK than a Normal Monster, respectively, which makes picking optimal Normal Monster dependent on the Decks you expect to play against.
  * "[[Primite Drillbeam]]" (negates effects) and "[[Primite Scream]]" (negates Summons) are interruptions that can recycle themselves (indefinitely or once, respectively), without the restrictions of "Howl" or "Roar".
  * "[[Primite Imperial Dragon]]", the lynchpin of the theme, can [[banish]] any opponent's monster that matches the [[Type]] OR [[Attribute]] of Normal Monsters in the player's [[Graveyard]], requiring careful selection of which monsters to put in the Deck.
  * Finally, "[[Primite Dragon Ether Beryl]]" and "[[Primite Lordly Lode]]" are the consistency cards, the former recycling itself indefinitely but requiring your [[Normal Summon]], which is not a problem thanks to the latter being able to virtually [[Special Summon]] a monster every turn.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Due to the archetypal [[List of unofficial terms|extenders]], "[[Primite Lordly Lode]]", "[[Primite Roar]]" and "[[Primite Howl]]", requiring [[Declares a card name|declaring]] a card's name, this theme is extremely vulnerable to "[[Engraver of the Mark]]".
  ** "[[Primite Dragon Ether Beryl]]" can partially make up for this by being able to give access to [[Normal Monsters]] without declaring their names, but it needs to be paired with cards that can retrieve said monsters from the [[Graveyard]].
