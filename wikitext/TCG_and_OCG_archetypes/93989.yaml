  "'''Magnet Warrior'''" (マグネット・ウォリアー, ''Magunetto Woriā''), is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Rock]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yugi Muto]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist|manga]], and by [[Bastion Misawa]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. It is a sub-archetype to "[[Magnet]]" archetypes, and itself has a sub-archetype, "[[Magnet Warrior Σ]]".

  "[[Magna Warrior]]" is a separate but related archetype. In French, German, Italian, and Portuguese, both archetypes have the same name, while they are distinct in all other languages; to prevent issues in those languages, all cards that support "Magnet Warrior" monsters and not "Magna Warrior" monsters only support Level 4 or lower monsters.

  == Design ==
  Each "Magnet Warrior" monster is named after a letter in the [[wikipedia:Greek alphabet|Greek alphabet]]. The ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'' "Magnet Warrior" monsters were originally comprised of a trio of [[Level 4]] [[Normal Monster]]s: "[[Alpha The Magnet Warrior|Alpha]]", "[[Beta The Magnet Warrior|Beta]]" and "[[Gamma The Magnet Warrior|Gamma]]", all of are required to [[Special Summon]] "[[Valkyrion the Magna Warrior]]", all of which were used by [[Yugi Mutou (manga)|Yugi Mutou]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga and his [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]] [[Yugi Muto|counterpart]]. This trio was later augmented with the addition of the [[Effect Monster]]s "[[Delta The Magnet Warrior]]" (whose effect can facilitate the Summoning of "Valkyrion") and "[[Epsilon The Magnet Warrior]]" (whose effect can [[send]] another "Magnet Warrior" monster and treat its name as the sent monster's).

  The original "Magnet Warrior" trio later received [[Level 3]] Effect Monster [[retrained]] counterparts known as "Electromagnet Warriors". They are also comprised of "[[Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior|Alpha]]", "[[Beta The Electromagnet Warrior|Beta]]", and "[[Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior|Gamma]]", all of which are required to Special Summon "[[Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior]]", a retrain of "Valkyrion".

  In the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' anime, the archetype also has an additional group of members featured in Bastion Misawa's Earth Deck. It is comprised of Level 4 Effect Monsters that feature the unique [[Plus monster|Plus]] and [[Minus monster|Minus monster]] sub-types, featuring effects that manipulate [[attack target]]s, either by preventing two monsters with the same sub-type from battling, or forcing both monsters with the opposing sub-types to battle each other. In the ''OCG''/''TCG'', the real-life effects of "[[Magnet Warrior Σ＋]]" and "[[Magnet Warrior Σ－]]" augment EARTH [[anti-support]] effects, with the former's effect referencing the attack manipulation strategy between Plus and Minus monsters, while the latter's effect references the prevention of battle between two monsters with the same aforementioned sub-types. In the anime, combining one Plus and one Minus monster is required to Special Summon "[[Conduction Warrior Linear Magnum ±]]"; in the ''OCG''/''TCG'', it can be Summoned by combining any two "Magnet Warrior" monsters.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Magnet Warrior" archetype focuses on Summoning the "Magna Warrior" boss monsters, which are comprised of 2-3 constituent monsters, and have effects to Summon back their materials. The first of the "Magna Warriors" was "[[Valkyrion the Magna Warrior|Valkyrion]]", which required itself in hand and 3 specific Normal Monsters on hand/field; while it had high ATK, it was too impractical. It has since received two major waves of support, one in ''[[Structure Deck: Yugi Muto]]'' that added the "Electromagnet Warriors", and another in ''[[Burst Protocol]]''.

  The newer cards typically focus on sending monsters to the GY, which can then be banished to Summon "[[Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior]]" or "[[Tellusrion the Magna Warrior]]", or used to benefit from "[[Magnetic Field]]'s" once per turn revive. "[[Magnet Bonding]]" can perform a Fusion Summon by shuffling from the GY or banishment, or search any monster in the archetype.

  ===Electromagnet Warriors===
  The Electromagnet Warriors share a Quick Effect to Tribute themselves to Summon a Level 4 "Magnet Warrior" on the opponent's turn, and have another effect on top:
  {| class="wikitable sortable" style="text-align:center"
  |-
  ! scope="col" | Electromagnet Warrior
  ! scope="col" | Unique [[Card effect|effect]]
  |-
  | [[Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior|Alpha]]
  | [[Add]]s a [[Level]] 8 "[[Magna Warrior]]" monster from its [[control]]ler's [[Deck]] to their [[hand]].
  |-
  | [[Beta The Electromagnet Warrior|Beta]]
  | Adds a Level 4 or lower "Magnet Warrior" monster with a different name from its controller's Deck to their hand.
  |-
  | [[Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior|Gamma]]
  | [[Special Summon]]s a Level 4 or lower "Magnet Warrior" monster with a different name from its controller's hand.
  |-
  |}

  Overall, they made it easier to get materials for "Valkyrion" and "Berserkion" (which can use material from GY, matching the GY Quick Effect). The ultimate goal of these cards is to Summon "[[Imperion Magnum the Superconductive Battlebot]]" by fusing "Valkyrion" and "Berserkion"; Imperion has an omni-negate and can float into "Valkyrion" and "Berserkion". However, it was ultimately too inconsistent, especially when compared to the "[[A-to-Z]]" support released at the same time.

  ===Post Structure Deck Support===
  The newer support increases the dumping and swarming capability of the archetype

  ! scope="col" | Unique [[Card effect|effect]]

  |-
  | [[Magnet Warrior Ω+]]
  | When an EARTH monster on field activates its effect (Quick Effect):<br>Tribute this card; flip a monster face-down. 
  |}

  In addition to the above monsters:
  *"[[Conduction Warrior Linear Magnum ±]]" can send 2 "Magnet Warriors" from Deck to GY to Summon itself.
  *"[[Conduction Knight Plasma Magnum]]" can be Fused with any two EARTH Rock monsters. It makes every monster EARTH, enabling the anti-EARTH effects of the +/- monsters, searches a "Magnet" Spell/Trap, and can dump a "Magna Warrior" as cost to Normal Summon a "Magnet Wariror". 
  *"[[Magnet Induction]]" can Summon a "Magnet Warrior" from Deck if one is on the field. 
  *"Magnet Bonding" can either search a Level 4 / "Conduction Warrior", a Level 8 "Magna Warrior", or perform a Fusion Summon by shuffling from field/GY/banishment (making "Imperion" more realistic). Each effect is once per turn, but all three effects can be used in a single turn.

  Notably, "Magnet Warriors" are linked to the "[[Bonding]]" archetype through "[[Magnet Bonding]]", so "[[Duoterion]]" and the multiple cards that search it are viable for play in the deck.
