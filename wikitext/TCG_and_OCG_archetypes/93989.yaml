  "'''Magnet Warrior'''" (マグネット・ウォリアー, ''Magunetto Woriā''), is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Rock]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yugi Muto]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist|manga]], and by [[Bastion Misawa]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. It is a sub-archetype to "[[Magnet]]" archetypes.

  "[[Magna Warrior]]" is a separate but related archetype. In French, German, Italian, and Portuguese, both archetypes have the same name, while they are distinct in all other languages; to prevent issues in those languages, all cards that support "Magnet Warrior" monsters and not "Magna Warrior" monsters only support Level 4 or lower monsters.

  == Design ==
  Each "Magnet Warrior" monster is named after a letter in the [[wikipedia:Greek alphabet|Greek alphabet]]. The ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'' "Magnet Warrior" monsters were originally comprised of a trio of [[Level 4]] [[Normal Monster]]s: "[[Alpha The Magnet Warrior|Alpha]]", "[[Beta The Magnet Warrior|Beta]]" and "[[Gamma The Magnet Warrior|Gamma]]", all of are required to [[Special Summon]] "[[Valkyrion the Magna Warrior]]", all of which were used by [[Yugi Mutou (manga)|Yugi Mutou]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga and his [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]] [[Yugi Muto|counterpart]]. This trio was later augmented with the addition of the [[Effect Monster]]s "[[Delta The Magnet Warrior]]" (whose effect can facilitate the Summoning of "Valkyrion") and "[[Epsilon The Magnet Warrior]]" (whose effect can [[send]] another "Magnet Warrior" monster and treat its name as the sent monster's).

  The original "Magnet Warrior" trio later received [[Level 3]] Effect Monster [[retrained]] counterparts known as "Electromagnet Warriors". They are also comprised of "[[Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior|Alpha]]", "[[Beta The Electromagnet Warrior|Beta]]", and "[[Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior|Gamma]]", all of which are required to Special Summon "[[Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior]]", a retrain of "Valkyrion".

  In the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' anime, the archetype also has an additional group of members featured in Bastion Misawa's Earth Deck. It is comprised of Level 4 Effect Monsters that feature the unique [[Plus monster|Plus]] and [[Minus monster|Minus monster]] sub-types, featuring effects that manipulate [[attack target]]s, either by preventing two monsters with the same sub-type from battling, or forcing both monsters with the opposing sub-types to battle each other. In the ''OCG''/''TCG'', the real-life effects of "[[Magnet Warrior Σ＋]]" and "[[Magnet Warrior Σ－]]" augment EARTH [[anti-support]] effects, with the former's effect referencing the attack manipulation strategy between Plus and Minus monsters, while the latter's effect references the prevention of battle between two monsters with the same aforementioned sub-types. In the anime, combining one Plus and one Minus monster is required to Special Summon "[[Conduction Warrior Linear Magnum ±]]"; in the ''OCG''/''TCG'', it can be Summoned by combining any two "Magnet Warrior" monsters.

  == Playing style ==
  When it was first introduced, the "Magnet Warrior" [[archetype]] focused on the [[control]]ler amassing the three [[Level]] 4 [[Normal Monster]]s, "[[Alpha The Magnet Warrior|Alpha]]", "[[Beta The Magnet Warrior|Beta]]" and "[[Gamma The Magnet Warrior|Gamma]]", in their [[hand]] and/or on their [[field]], then [[Tribute|Tributing]] them to [[Special Summon]] "[[Valkyrion the Magna Warrior]]" from the hand. Given its high [[ATK]], "Valkyrion" mainly served as a potent [[beatstick]], and possessed an effect that allowed it to be Tributed for the controller to Special Summon the "Magnet Warrior" monsters from the [[Graveyard]], following which, they could be used as either Tributes for stronger monsters or [[Xyz Material]]s for a [[Rank]] 4 [[Xyz Monster]]. As "Valkyrion" is a [[Special Summon-only monster]], being sent to the Graveyard also enabled the controller to later Special Summon it and Tribute it again to Special Summon the "Magnet Warrior" monsters and further fuel more of such combos.
  Following the release of ''[[Structure Deck: Yugi Muto]]'', the archetype gained several new members and support, along with a new focus which oriented towards Special Summoning "[[Imperion Magnum the Superconductive Battlebot]]". The archetype's new members were "[[Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior]]", "[[Beta The Electromagnet Warrior]]" and "[[Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior]]", Level 3 Effect Monsters that were [[retrained]] from the Level 4 Normal Monsters who each had two effects. The first effect was unique to the monster and can be activated if the monster was [[Normal Summon|Normal]] or [[Special Summon]]ed. The second effect allows the controller to Tribute the monster during the opponent's turn to Special Summon a Level 4 "Magnet Warrior" monster from the [[Deck]], enabling the "Electromagnet Warrior" monsters to dodge the opponent's card effects that affect them, whilst also searching out more "Magnet Warrior" monsters to thin the Deck.

  |}
  The "Electromagnet Warrior" monsters added greater flexibility to the archetype, with the first effects of "[[Beta The Electromagnet Warrior|Beta]]" and "[[Gamma The Electromagnet Warrior|Gamma]]" promoting the propagation of more "Magnet Warrior" monsters in the [[hand]] and on the [[field]], while the effect of "[[Alpha The Electromagnet Warrior|Alpha]]" enabled an increased ability to [[search]] out the "Magna Warrior" monsters. The "Electromagnet Warrior" monsters were also oriented towards [[banish]]ing themselves from the hand, field, and/or [[Graveyard]] to [[Special Summon]] "[[Berserkion the Electromagna Warrior]]", a [[retrain]] of "[[Valkyrion the Magna Warrior]]". They can easily accomplish this via using their second effects to place themselves in the Graveyard to be banished.
  Like its predecessor, "Berserkion" possesses an effect that Special Summons the banished monsters used to [[Summon]] it back to the field, in this case, if it is destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect. Another thread of commonality shared by "Berserkion" and "Valkyrion" is the fact that both are [[Special Summon-only monsters]], allowing for the easy revival of the former should it be [[destroy]]ed, while Special Summoning the "Electromagnet Warrior" monsters for the controller to use as either [[Tribute]]s or [[Xyz Material]]s for a [[Rank]] 3 [[Xyz Monster]]. "Berserkion" also has an additional effect wherein it destroys a card the opponent controls if the controller [[banish]]es a [[Level]] 4 or lower "Magnet Warrior" monster from their [[Graveyard]], allowing for quick removal of problematic cards on the opponent's [[field]].
  Additionally, the archetype's new support has provided it with a strategy of placing "Magnet Warrior" monsters in the Graveyard and then immediately [[Special Summon]]ing them via the effect of "[[Magnetic Field]]", provided the controller has another "Magnet Warrior" monster on their field. In addition to increasing field presence, this effect also allows the controller quick access to the first effects of the "Electromagnet Warrior" monsters. The second effect of "Magnetic Field" returns an opponent's monster to the hand if it battled an [[EARTH]] [[Rock]] monster the controller controls, and the opponent's monster was not destroyed by battle. This effect grants the controller the ability to use the archetype's monsters offensively to remove the opponent's monsters and make up for their low [[ATK]], or defensively by deterring attacks from the opponent. The second effect of "Magnetic Field" thus addresses the survivability issues of the "Magnet Warrior" [[Normal Monster]]s if they are Special Summoned via the second effects of the "Electromagnet Warrior" monsters.
  The archetype's goal of [[Special Summon]]ing the "Magna Warrior" monsters is further aided by the first effect of "[[Magnet Conversion]]", which adds 3 Level 4 or lower "Magnet Warrior" monsters from the [[Graveyard]] to the [[hand]]. This allows the controller to retrieve the "Magnet Warrior" [[Normal Monster]]s to [[Tribute]] for a Summon of "Valkyrion", especially if they are [[destroy]]ed by the opponent following their Summon via the second effects of the "Electromagnet Warrior" monsters. Alternatively, the effect can also be used to [[add]] the "Electromagnet Warrior" monsters to make use of their first effects again. To fuel the latter purpose, the second effects of the "Electromagnet Warrior" monsters can be used to place them in the Graveyard.

  Notably "Magnet Warriors" are linked to the "[[Bonding]]" archetype through "[[Magnet Bonding]]", and so "[[Duoterion]]" and the multiple cards that search it are viable for play in the deck.
