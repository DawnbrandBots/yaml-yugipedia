  {{Quote|Challenge the mysteries of the world with "Runick"! |source=The archetype's tagline in promotional material}}
  "'''Runick'''", known as "'''Rune'''" ({{Ruby|神碑|ルーン}} ''Rūn'') in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Tactical Masters]]''/''[[Tactical Masters]]''.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 05: Runick}}

  ==Etymology==
  The Japanese name of the archetype uses the kanji characters 「神碑」 (''Shinpi''), literally meaning "Divine Runestone", which likely refers to "[[Runick Fountain]]"; however, it has the forced reading of 「ルーン」 (''Rūn''). 「神碑」 is also homophonous with the word 「神秘」 (''Shinpi'', "Mystery").

  The English name of the archetype is likely a [[wikipedia:portmanteau|portmanteau]] of the words "[[wikipedia:Rune|runic]]" (an adjective meaning 'of or related to runes') and "[[wikipedia:Magic (supernatural)|magick]]", the latter being an archaic spelling for the word "magic".

  ==Design==
  The "Runick" monsters are based on [[wikipedia:Norse mythology|Norse mythology]] and Germanic [[wikipedia:Runes|runes]]. They also feature elements from video games, primarily [[wikipedia:Action role-playing game|action RPGs]]. Specifically, the non-Quick Play cards are based on characters connected to [[wikipedia:Odin|Odin]], who sacrificed an eye to the [[wikipedia:Mímisbrunnr|Mímisbrunnr]] in order to obtain wisdom, and performed great self-sacrifice to [[wikipedia:Runes#Runes_in_Eddic_poetry|discover the power of runes]], which are likely represented by the quick-play spells.

  The artworks of all "Runick" [[Spell Card]]s are drawn from a first-person perspective, usually with the hand of the POV character being visibly in frame. This is likely intended to mimic the appearance of a first-person RPG. Their artworks also each depict a different weapon/ability being used by the POV character, and have different settings.

  The "[[Generaider]]" monsters, which are also based on Norse mythology and video games, are related to this archetype, as evidenced by "[[Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses]]" appearing in the artwork of "[[Runick Allure]]", and the same characters appearing in both "[[Generaider Boss Fight]]" and "[[Runick Dispelling]]".

  ===Members===
  ====Spell Cards====
  The "Runick" [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s are based on various spells and equipment that incorporate specific runes.

  Most of the "Runick" Quick-Play Spells are related to "[[Generaider|Generaider Boss]]" monsters, representing the player character's actions in their individual realms; the specific counterparts are identified in [[The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines]].

  ==Playing style==
  "Runick" revolves around [[Quick-Play Spell]]s that provide generically powerful effects and bonus [[mill]]ing, at the cost of completely forgoing the [[Battle Phase]]. 

  The archetype has no Main Deck monsters, the Extra Deck monsters have little/no ATK, and most of its card effects skip the [[Battle Phase]]. Therefore, a pure strategy will focus on [[Stun]] and [[Deck out]]. Such Decks are typically played with generic floodgates (e.g. "[[Inspector Boarder]]", "[[Amano-Iwato]]", and "[[Synchro Zone]]"), with the "Runick" cards provide card draws, interruptions, removal, and floodgate protection. By floodgating the opponent out of their plays, the deck can easily Deck out the opponent over a few turns.

  The archetype can also be hybridized with other engines (e.g., "[[Spright]]"), becoming part of a combo-control Deck. Here, the "Runick" Quick-Plays can be used as interaction or as a pseudo-"[[Instant Fusion]]", summoning low-level Fusions as extenders, while "Runick Fountain" is used for quick bursts of card advantage. These Decks play closer to a [[Control Strategy]], aiming to outgrind the opponent and win once the Battle Phase becomes available again.

  === Cards ===
  The "Runick" Quick-Play Spells which the archetype revolves around share the following format:
  * Activate 1 of these effects, but skip your next Battle Phase after activation;
  ** [Card's unique effect], then banish cards from the top of the opponent's Deck.
  ** Special Summon 1 "Runick" monster from your [[Extra Deck]] to the [[Extra Monster Zone]].

  The [[Field Spell]] "[[Runick Fountain]]" is the archetype's main source of card advantage: it lets the player activate "Runick" Quick-Play Spells from the [[hand]] in the opponent's turn, and [[once per turn]] (in either player's turn) it can return up to 3 "Runick" Quick-Play Spells from the [[Graveyard]] to the Deck and [[draw]] that many cards.

  The Continuous Spell "[[Runick Allure]]" provides additional mills in a milling-focused "Runick" strategy.

  The two key "Runick" monsters are "[[Hugin the Runick Wings|Hugin]]", who searches "[[Runick Fountain]]" and protects against destruction effects, and "[[Munin the Runick Wings|Munin]]", who protects against targeting effects. "[[Geri the Runick Fangs|Geri]]" and "[[Freki the Runick Fangs|Freki]]" can recover "Runick" Spells from the Graveyard. Finally, "[[Sleipnir the Runick Mane|Sleipnir]]" can banish an opponent's monster temporarily, and summon a Token for an additional body.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Floodgates:
  ** Anti-Spell: "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]", "[[Eradicator Epidemic Virus]]", "[[Invader of Darkness]]", "[[Secret Village of the Spellcasters]]", "[[Spell Canceller]]"
  ** Anti-Graveyard: "[[Macro Cosmos]]"
  ** Anti-Banishing: "[[Chaos Hunter]]", "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]"
  * The archetype critically depends on its [[Field Spell]] "[[Runick Fountain]]" to maintain card advantage, making it a prime target for the opponent's removal effects. However, "Runick Fountain" can be protected via a couple of their Fusion Monsters which can be Special Summoned at any time via their Quick-Play Spells; namely "[[Hugin the Runick Wings]]" (which can banish itself to protect "Runick Fountain" in response to destruction effects) and "[[Munin the Runick Wings]]" (which can negate any opponent's card or effect that targets a "Runick" card or a Set card). As such, non-destruction removal options such as "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]"  (while "Munin" is not present) are highly preferred for ultimately dealing with "Runick Fountain".
  * The archetype has almost no [[Monster Zone]] presence, and is almost entirely dependent on randomly-[[draw]]n "Runick" [[Quick-Play Spell]]s to provide interaction, making it quite fragile.
  ** Utilizing external engines, or even external cards in general, reduces the chances of the player drawing into additional "Runick" cards off of "Runick Fountain", slowing down the Deck's tempo and disruptive capabilities.
  * [[Deck]]s with cards that [[activate]] their effects when [[banish]]ed, like "[[Shiranui]]" or "[[Maliss]]", could use this archetype's strategy of banishing the opponent's cards to their own advantage.
