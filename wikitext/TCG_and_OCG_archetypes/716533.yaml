  {{Quote|The archetype's tagline in promotional material|Challenge the mysteries of the world with "Runick"!}}
  "'''Runick'''", known as "'''Rune'''" ({{Ruby|神碑|ルーン}} ''Rūn'') in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Tactical Masters]]''/''[[Tactical Masters]]''.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 05: Runick}}

  ==Etymology==
  The Japanese name of the archetype uses the kanji characters 「神碑」 (''Shinpi''), literally meaning "Divine Runestone", which likely refers to "[[Runick Fountain]]"; however, it has the forced reading of 「ルーン」 (''Rūn''). 「神碑」 is also homophonous with the word 「神秘」 (''Shinpi'', "Mystery").

  The English name of the archetype is likely a [[wikipedia:portmanteau|portmanteau]] of the words "rune" and "[[wikipedia:Magic (supernatural)|magick]]", the latter being an archaic spelling for the word "magic".

  ==Design==
  The "Runick" monsters are based on [[wikipedia:Norse mythology|Norse mythology]] and Germanic [[wikipedia:Runes|runes]]. They also feature elements from video games, primarily [[wikipedia:Action role-playing game|action RPGs]].

  The artworks of all "Runick" [[Spell Card]]s are drawn from a first-person perspective, usually with the hand of the POV character being visibly in frame. This is likely intended to mimic the appearance of a first-person RPG. Their artworks also each depict a different weapon/ability being used by the POV character, and have different settings.

  The "[[Generaider]]" monsters, which are also based on Norse mythology and video games, are related to this archetype, as evidenced by "[[Loptr, Shadow of the Generaider Bosses]]" appearing in the artwork of "[[Runick Allure]]", and the same characters appearing in both "[[Generaider Boss Fight]]" and "[[Runick Dispelling]]".

  ===Members===
  ====Spell Cards====
  The "Runick" [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s are based on various spells and equipment that incorporate specific runes.

  Most of the "Runick" Quick-Play Spells are related to "[[Generaider|Generaider Boss]]" monsters, representing the player character's actions in their individual realms; the specific counterparts are identified in [[The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines]].

  ==Playing style==
  "Runick" is an archetype almost entirely made up of [[Spell Card]]s (especially [[Quick-Play Spell]]s), with a near-exclusive focus on a Stun and [[Deck out]] strategy. The archetype has no [[Main Deck]] monsters, is generally unable to inflict battle damage (whether due to their monsters having 0 [[ATK]], or an effect that [[prevents battle damage]]), and the effects of all its Quick-Play Spells cause the player to skip their next [[Battle Phase]].

  All "Runick" Quick-Play Spells can be [[activate]]d [[only once per turn]], and each allows choosing between one of two effects: a unique effect that provides consistency/disruption/Deck [[mill]]ing and then [[banish]]es a varied number of cards from the top of the opponent's Deck, or a shared effect to [[Special Summon]] 1 "Runick" monster from the [[Extra Deck]] to the [[Extra Monster Zone]]. Activating either effect of a "Runick" Quick-Play Spell requires the player to skip their next Battle Phase.

  The central card of the "Runick" resource loop is its [[Field Spell]] "[[Runick Fountain]]": it lets the player activate "Runick" Quick-Play Spells from the [[hand]] during the opponent's turn, and [[once per turn]] (during either player's turn) it can place up to 3 "Runick" Quick-Play Spells from the [[Graveyard]] to the bottom of the Deck and have the player [[draw]] that many cards.

  "Runick" Extra Deck monsters form the archetype's defensive strategy, providing additional searching or recursion, protection against battle or effects, disruption, and on-field bodies that can be used for monster-based combos. The two key monsters are "[[Hugin the Runick Wings|Hugin]]", who searches "[[Runick Fountain]]" and protects against destruction effects, and "[[Munin the Runick Wings|Munin]]", who protects against targeting effects. "[[Geri the Runick Fangs|Geri]]" and "[[Freki the Runick Fangs|Freki]]" can recover "Runick" Spells from the Graveyard. Finally, "[[Sleipnir the Runick Mane|Sleipnir]]" can banish an opponent's monster temporarily, and summon a Token for an additional body.

  As a pure Deck, "Runick" is fully focused on countering the opponent's plays and decking out the opponent over multiple turns. Playing the deck pure maximizes the draw efficiency and quality of "Runick Fountain", and maximizes the milling speed with the increased amount of "Runick" activations. As such, the deck often utilizes cards such as "[[Inspector Boarder]]", "[[Amano-Iwato]]", and "[[Synchro Zone]]" to limit the opponent's actions, prevent them from disrupting your "Runick Fountain" draws and "Runick" Quick-Play Spells.

  However, the deck can also be hybridized with other engines to support their combos; "Runick" Quick-Play Spells provide the versatility of being able to both be used as utility, and also as pseudo-"[[Instant Fusion]]", able to easily [[Special Summon]] low-level [[Fusion Monster]]s to serve as combo extenders, and "Runick Fountain" provides quick boosts of card advantage. Such hybrid decks usually play much closer to a control-based strategy, aiming to out-grind the opponent and eventually attack for victory once Battle Phases become available again.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Since this archetype focuses mostly on [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s, cards that counter them (or counter [[Spell Card]]s in general) can be extremely dangerous, such as "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]", "[[Eradicator Epidemic Virus]]", "[[Secret Village of the Spellcasters]]", and "[[Spell Canceller]]".
  * The archetype critically depends on its [[Field Spell]] "[[Runick Fountain]]" to maintain its card advantage, making it a prime target for the opponent's removal effects. However, "Runick Fountain" can be protected via a couple of their Fusion Monsters which can be Special Summoned at any time via their Quick-Play Spells; namely "[[Hugin the Runick Wings]]" (which can banish itself to protect "Runick Fountain" in response to destruction effects) and "[[Munin the Runick Wings]]" (which can negate any opponent's card or effect that targets a "Runick" card or a set card). As such, non-destruction removal options such as "[[Cosmic Cyclone]]" (while "Munin" is not present) are highly preferred for ultimately dealing with "Runick Fountain".
  * The archetype has almost no [[Monster Zone]] presence, and is almost entirely dependent on randomly-[[draw]]n "Runick" [[Quick-Play Spell]]s to provide disruption and protection, making it quite fragile.
  ** Utilizing external engines, or even external cards in general, reduces the chances of the player drawing into additional "Runick" cards off of "Runick Fountain", slowing down the Deck's tempo and disruptive capabilities significantly.
  * The Deck's playstyle is countered by anti-Graveyard floodgates like "[[Macro Cosmos]]", which can prevent "Runick Fountain" from returning cards to draw cards. Or anti-banishing effects, such as that of "[[Chaos Hunter]]" or "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]".
  * [[Deck]]s with cards that [[activate]] their effects when [[banish]]ed, like the "[[Shiranui]]" monsters, could use this archetype's strategy of banishing the opponent's cards to their own advantage.
