  "'''Synchro'''" (シンクロ ''Shinkuro'') is an [[archetype]] of cards related to [[Synchro Monster]]s and [[Tuner monster]]s. They appear most frequently in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's|''Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds'' anime]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (manga)|manga]], although a few also appear in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. While members have existed since ''[[Starter Deck 2008]]'', the did not receive support until ''[[Duelist Nexus]]''.

  The only support for the theme is "[[Duelist Genesis]]", which interacts sorely with [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s, although the archetype technically includes every "[[Synchron]]" and "[[Synchro Dragon]]" monster as their names make those themes sub-archetypes of this one. As the name suggests, most "Synchro" cards [[support]] Synchro Monsters or Tuners, or facilitate [[Synchro Summon]]ing, and many of their artworks reference this by depicting Synchro rings, [[Level]] stars, Synchro Monsters, and/or Tuner monsters.

  Before the release of the card "Duelist Genesis", the English names of "[[Synch Blast Wave]]" and "[[Synch Realm]]" had "Synchro" in their name, but have since been renamed because they are not members of this archetype, as their Japanese names do not include 「シンクロ」.
