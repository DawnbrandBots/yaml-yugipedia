  "'''tellarknight'''" (テラナイト ''Teranaito'') is an [[archetype]] that debuted in ''[[Duelist Alliance]]''. It is mainly composed of [[LIGHT]] [[Warrior]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that focus on the quick and easy Summoning of monsters, their effects often activating upon being Summoned by ''any'' means, including [[Normal Summon]], [[Special Summon]] and even [[Flip Summon]]. 
  This archetype's artwork, name and type of gameplay is similar to that of the "[[Constellar]]s", with later support for both themes tying them together. The archetype contains a sub-archetype, "[[Stellarknight]]".

  ==Origin==
  ===Lore===
  {{Main|Master Guide 5 card storylines}}
  {{Blockquote|text=''As if in a resonance with the birth of the giant divine dragon "[[Baxia, Brightness of the Yang Zing]]" by "[[Chiwen, Light of the Yang Zing]]"’s power, warriors of light descended from the brilliant stars in the sky.''}}
  They are the descendents of the "Constellar", the brigade of saviors that fought to save this planet in the previous great war. "[[Constellar Sombre]]", being herself the result of the fusion of the 12 "Constellar" heroes, released the power of the 12 constellations, the "''12 constellation rings"'', from herself, and returned them to the new warriors. The warriors of light, upon regaining that power, turned them into the "Tellarings", and transformed themselves into the '''Tellarknight''', the protectors of the planet. With their new power, the warriors headed toward the battlefield to confront the "[[Shaddoll]]".
  ===Names===
  This archetype's name is a portmanteau of the words "(s)tellar"/"(sa)tellar" and "knight".
  The "Satellarknight" monsters are named after the [[wikipedia:List of brightest stars|brightest stars]] in our night sky, while the "Stellarknight" monsters are named after the [[wikipedia:Asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] formed by those stars. The background of their artworks all feature the constellations that contain their respective namesake stars, with the locations of said stars in those constellations denoted by the star being distinctly encircled.
  === Artworks ===
  {| class="wikitable"
  !Armor
  |While each member represents a single star, their armor is designed after the entire constellation. Its representation can be seen in the helmet of most of the members. For example, the head of the serpent can be seen in the helmet of [[Satellarknight Unukalhai|Unukalhai]], while its tail follows his body.
  All members incorporate yellow parts on their armor. The yellow is most often associated with the color of kings, but also the friendship or the light, which perfectly fits this archetype.
  |-
  !Ring
  |All "Satellarknight" monster are encircled by a slightly inclined ring. The ring symbolizes the power of ''connecting the stars'', which is used to connect stars between them and call a monster that is the result of this fusion.
  Strongly inspired by that of the [[Constellar]]s, the emblem of this archetype represents a star, nor the brightness of the light. It can usually be found at least one time on the armor of each member.
  |-
  !United form
  |The concept of asterism is retaken here with the "[[Stellarknight]]" monsters, the association of different "Satellarknight" monsters. In the case of Delteros, pieces of armors, as well as the rings of Deneb, Altair and Vega are united together in order to evolve and form the Summer Triangle and its shield. On the latter is proudly worn the [[wikipedia:Heraldry|armory]] of the archetype, such as knights.
  |-
  !Physical details
  |Each member carries a color in accordance with the symbolism of their constellation. Moreover, a star can be seen in each member's eyes while their mouth is hidden by a piece of cloth. In some case, the background's color is retaken from the star's color herself.
  |}
  ===Members===
  Each Main Deck "Satellarknight" monster is based on one of the brightest stars from the [[wikipedia:IAU designated constellations|88 constellations]] (primarily the constellations established by [[wikipedia:Ptolemy|Ptolemy]]).
  "[[Stellarknight Zefraxciton]]" is the only Main Deck "Tellarknight" that is called a "Stellarknight". Instead of a specific star, "Zefraxciton" is based on one of the constellations themselves.

  ==Playing style==
  The archetype focuses on rapid swarm tactics and gaining advantage to facilitate the Summon of Rank 4 [[Xyz Monster]]s. This generally revolves around using "[[Satellarknight Deneb]]" to search "tellarknight" monsters and [[Special Summon]]ing them, either with the effects of "[[Satellarknight Altair]]" and "[[Satellarknight Vega]]", or by [[Pendulum Summon]]ing them by placing "[[Satellarknight Zefrathuban]]" and "[[Stellarknight Zefraxciton]]" in the [[Pendulum Zone]]. This swarming can be further extended with "[[Tellarknight Altairan]]" and "[[Tellarknight Lyran]]", who have effects to Special Summon themselves from the GY and hand, respectively; "Altairan" can be sent from the Deck to the GY with "[[Satellarknight Unukalhai]]".

  The archetype can also Summon Rank 5 Xyz Monsters by using "[[Tellarknight Ptolemaeus]]" or "[[Satellarknight Capella]]". In addition, their own Rank 5 monster, "[[Stellarknight Constellar Diamond]]", can Summon itself during [[Main Phase 2]] or be Summoned by "[[Darktellarknight Batlamyus]]".

  Thanks to "[[Tellarknight Constellar Caduceus]]", it's also possible to swarm further by having it copy the effect of "[[Constellar Sheratan]]" to add "[[Constellar Caduceus]]" to the hand and Special Summon it by its own effect, then using it to search "[[Constellar Tellarknights]]" and Summon even more monsters. "Constellar Tellarknights" is also the easiest way to enable the turn skip effect of "Tellarknight Ptolmaeus": a player can use 5 Level 4 monsters as material to Xyz Summon "Tellarknight Constellar Caduceus", then use it as material to Summon "[[Constellar Ptolemy M7]]", and finally use the second effect of "Constellar Tellarknights" to Xyz Summon "Ptolmaeus" by using "M7" as material, resulting in it having 7 materials.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * Cards that restrict Special Summoning, such as "[[El Shaddoll Winda]]", severely hamper the archetype's ability to swarm the field.
  * Cards that prevent cards from entering the GY, like "[[Dimensional Fissure]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]", will prevent "Altair" from using its effect, and "Altairan" will be banished and thus become unable to use its GY effect. "[[Necrovalley]]" or "[[Gravekeeper's Trap]]" can have a similar effect due to their preventing monsters from being Summoned from the GY.
  ** "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" is especially dangerous, as it also banishes a card from the hand after "Deneb" tries to search a card.
  * "[[Skill Drain]]" effectively shuts down all of the archetype's monster effects. "[[Light-Imprisoning Mirror]]" can also work, but it cannot prevent the hand effect of "Lyran" and the player will be able to Xyz Summon "[[Tornado Dragon]]" to destroy it.
  * Hand traps such as "[[Effect Veiler]]" and "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" can be real gear grinders for this deck, preventing the player from gaining advantage.
  * Activating "[[Droll & Lock Bird]]" in response to the effect of "Deneb" can prevent a player from searching with the copied effect of "Constellar Sheratan" and with "Constellar Caduceus".
  * A well-timed "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]" can stop an attempted "Ptolmaeus" turn skip by destroying "Constellar Tellarknights".

  * "[[Darktellarknight Batlamyus]]" is the only member to not figure any constellation in his background, as well as the only [[DARK]] monster in the archetype.
  * "[[Stellarknight Zefraxciton]]", "[[Stellarknight Constellar Diamond]]" and "[[Tellarknight Constellar Caduceus]]" are the only members to not be [[Warrior]] monsters.
  ** "Stellarknight Constellar Diamond" is the only monster that isn't [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 4.
