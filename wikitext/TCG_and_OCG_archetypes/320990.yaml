  "'''U.A.'''", short for "'''Ultra Athlete'''" ({{Ruby|Ｕ．Ａ．|ウルトラアスリート}} ''Urutora Asurīto''), is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Warrior]] monsters that debuted in ''[[Duelist Alliance]]''. It was one of two [[TCG exclusive|''TCG'' exclusive]] archetypes to debut in that set, the other being the "[[Burning Abyss]]" archetype.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|Master Duel card storylines#And the Crowd Goes Wild!}}

  ==Design==
  The archetype is based on positions played in various popular team sports, with every set including monsters hailing from a different sport. The Spell and Trap Cards represent various aspects of sports.

  The "[[F.A.]]" is a counterpart to this archetype, with a similar style and also being formerly TCG-exclusive. This is further enforced by the [[Spell Card|Spells]] and [[Trap Card|Trap]] from ''[[Phantom Rage]]'', which are members of and support both archetypes.

  ==Playing style==
  Most "U.A." monsters share the same [[effect]] of [[Special Summon]] themselves by [[return]]ing a different "U.A." monster from the [[field]] to the [[hand]]. The [[Field Spell Card|Field Spell]] "[[U.A. Stadium]]" can search an "U.A." monster when another one is [[Normal Summon]]ed, and gives a permanent [[ATK]] boost of 500 to all your monsters (not limited to "U.A." monsters) when you Special Summon an "U.A." monster for the first time during any turn, once per turn.
  The basic strategy is to Normal Summon "[[U.A. Midfielder]]" or "[[U.A. Libero Spiker]]" each turn, allowing you to add "U.A." monsters to your hand via the effect of "[[U.A. Stadium]]". Summon aggressive monsters like "[[U.A. Mighty Slugger]]" and "[[U.A. Playmaker]]" during your Main Phase 1, attack using the protection that "Slugger" grants, then swap your monsters out during the Main Phase 2 for protective monsters like "[[U.A. Goalkeeper]]" and "[[U.A. Perfect Ace]]". In the event that you don't have an ideal set-up of "U.A. Stadium" and "U.A. Midfielder", Tribute Summons can be facilitated with "[[Heroic Challenger]]", "[[Hieratic]]", or "[[Burning Abyss]]" monsters, to name a few, as well as "[[The Monarchs Stormforth]]", "[[Feast of the Wild LV5]]", etc.
  A [[Pendulum]] variant can be obtained by adding "[[Dragodies, the Empowered Warrior]]" and "[[Dragonox, the Empowered Warrior]]" to the Deck: their monster effect allow to search or Summon from the [[Graveyard]] some of the key monsters of the archetype, while their Pendulum Scales speed up the swarming process.

  ===Weaknesses===
  The U.A. archetype is extremely reliant on its first Normal Summon; effects that remove the Normal Summoned monster from the field can essentially end a "U.A." player's turn, if they control no other monsters. Likewise, cards that prohibit or punish Special Summoning can be effective, such as "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]" or "[[Maxx "C"]]".
  Due to the amazing amount of searches it gives, destroying "[[U.A. Stadium]]" also deals a critical blow to this Deck. Cards such as "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]" and "[[Mistake]]" can also achieve the same goal in preventing these searches.
  Using "[[Degenerate Circuit]]" will prevent your opponent from Special Summoning any "U.A." monsters by their own effects, since they need to return a "U.A." monster to the hand, but cannot.
