  "'''Metalmorph'''", known as "'''Metallization'''" (メタル{{Ruby|化|か}} ''Metaru-ka'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Trap Card]]s based on [[Metalmorph|the eponymous card]] used by [[Bandit Keith]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]], which is known for transforming monsters into what are popularly known as "Metal counterparts", most notably "[[Zoa]]" and "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]". It received its first support in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]'', more than two decades after the debut of the original "Metalmorph".

  "[[Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite]]" and "[[Metallizing Parasite - Soltite]]" are also members of this archetype in the ''OCG''; however, since support for this archetype only interacts with Trap Cards, this isn't an issue.

  == Design ==
  "[[Metalmorph]]" and its derivations have transformed a number of monsters into Metal versions of themselves in various media. 

  During the [[Duelist Kingdom]] tournament of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|manga]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]], before the series switched to using concrete rules and effects, [[Machine]]-[[Type]] monsters had immunity to Spell effects and so-called "magical attacks" as an innate trait. In [[Joey Wheeler]] and [[Bandit Keith]]'s Duel, the latter attempted to trick the former into targeting his [[Fiend]]-Type "Zoa" with Spells, before he used "Metalmorph" to turn it into a Machine ("[[Metalzoa]]"), thus giving it Spell immunity. However, Joey used "[[Copycat]]" to copy Keith's "Metalmorph", allowing him to likewise turn his "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]" into a Machine ("[[Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon]]"). Of note, the anime version of this Duel had "Metalmorph" renamed to "[[Magic Metal Force]]", possibly to avoid confusion over the real-life version of the card having been printed with a different effect before the episodes in question aired. Despite this, other appearances of the card used the original name.

  A similar card to the anime/manga version of "Metalmorph", "[[Metal Plus]]", was used by the [[Nightshroud]]-possessed [[Atticus Rhodes]] during his second Duel with [[Jaden Yuki]] to turn "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon]]" into "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon]]". However, the printed version of the latter was given a completely different effect, turning it into a stand-alone card with no connection to this archetype aside from the name.

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories]]'', "[[Metalmorph (FMR)|Metalmorph]]" is capable of transforming other miscellaneous monsters into similar mechanic ones that are unrelated to it in other media, such as "[[Baby Dragon (FMR)|Baby Dragon]]" to "[[Metal Dragon (FMR)|Metal Dragon]]" and "[[Jirai Gumo (FMR)|Jirai Gumo]]" to "[[Launcher Spider (FMR)|Launcher Spider]]".

  === Metal counterparts ===
  So far, every Metal [[counterpart]] is 1 [[Level]] higher than its base form, except for the game-original "[[Metal Illusionist]]". This might be because in contrast to the other Metal counterparts representing their base form powered up by "Metalmorph", "Metal Illusionist" instead references "[[Copycat]]" copying "Metalmorph".

  Two special cases also exist; "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon]]" and "[[Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon]]", who are the Metal counterparts of "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon]]" (transformed by "[[Metal Plus]]") and "[[Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon]]" (combined with "[[Black Metal Dragon]]") respectively but are unrelated to the "Metalmorph" archetype and are not Machine monsters.

  == Playstyle ==
  The core premises of the archetype involve Traps that give monsters ATK-increasing or protection effects, and [[Tributing]] non-Machine monsters for their Machine or metallic counterparts. The support released in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]'' onwards focuses on "[[Max Metalmorph]]" and cards that mention it. 

  "[[Max Metalmorph]]" itself can Tribute a monster to summon a monster that cannot be Normal Summoned/Set and mentions "Max Metalmorph" from hand/Deck/GY. Afterwards, it equips itself to the monster, giving it targeting/destruction protection from monsters and Spells. Currently, the three valid targets for this Trap include:
  *"[[Red-Eyes Black Fullmetal Dragon]]", which requires activating "Max Metalmorph" by Tributing a Level 5 or higher Dragon. On field, it acts as an omni-negate that deals burn damage.
  *"[[Metalzoa X]]", which requires activating "Max Metalmorph" by Tributing a Level 5 or higher Fiend. On field, it can destroy up to two opposing monsters per turn (when your opponent activates a card/effect).
  *"[[Metalflame Swordsman]]", which requires activating "Max Metalmorph" by Tributing a Level 5 or higher Warrior. On field, it gains ATK and deals burn damage whenever the opponent activates a card/effect.

  Each of the three above monsters can shuffle themselves from hand to Deck to search a "Metalmorph" Trap or a "Max Metalmorph"-related monster, depending on the monster. An alternative to "Max Metalmorph" is "[[Flame Coating Metalmorph]]", a Trap that can summon the three monsters, ignoring their summoning conditions; it instead requires Tributing a monster that mentions "Max Metalmorph". However, "Flame Coating" offers arguably worse protection and does not properly Special Summon a monster, meaning they cannot be re-Summoned with a card like "[[Time Machine]]".

  Other consistency cards include:
  * "[[Metal Illusionist]]", which can Set a "Metalmorph" Trap from Deck, can increase its Level and change its Type, and draws an additional card if "Max Metalmorph" is in the GY.
  * "[[Zoa the Fiendish Beast]]",  which can Set a "Metalmorph" Trap from Deck. Unlike "Metal Illusionist", it can Special Summon itself from hand (but if "Max Metalmorph" is not in your GY, allows the opponent to Special Summon a monster from hand). Can be used with "[[Flame Coating Metalmorph]]" to summon any "Max Metalmorph"-only monster.
  * "[[Incoming Machine!]]", a Spell that adds a monster that mentions "Max Metalmorph", or a "Metalmorph" Trap from the Deck or GY. Unlike most modern searchers, the search is not subject to a hard [[once per turn]] restriction.

  As a whole, the "Max Metalmorph" cards can be played as an engine in their respective Type decks. For example, "Dragon Link" Decks can use "Red-Eyes Black Fullmetal Dragon" (which can be searched by "[[Black Metal Dragon]]" due to also being a "[[Red-Eyes]]" card), while "[[Unchained]]" is a Fiend archetype that is heavily destruction-oriented. However, through the use of "Metal Illusionist" or "Zoa the Fiendish Beast" with "Flame Coating Metalmorph", the "Metalmorph" engine can also be splashed into Decks of different Types.

  The engine can also see use alongside an "[[Armored Xyz (archetype)|Armored Xyz]]" package within allowing [[Level]]s/[[Rank]]s among a Deck's monsters, given the latter package's "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]" can benefit from its effect to attach an opponent's monster to itself being able to activate at [[Spell Speed 2]] by way of the "Metalmorph" Traps equipping themselves to monsters at such effect speed.

  The original two monsters, "[[Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon]]" and "[[Metalzoa]]", have the ability to summon themselves from the Deck, but require Tributing specific vanilla monsters and have no effects on field.

  === Weakness ===
  * Each "metallic" boss monsters of the "Metalmorph" archetype are inherently [[garnet]]; both "Red-Eyes Fullmetal Dragon" and "Metalzoa X" cannot shuffle themselves back into the Deck if there are no "Metalmorph" Trap Cards for them to set on the field. This is less likely to happen for "Metalflame Swordsman" due to the greater quantity of search targets.
  * Since "Metalmorph" Deck rely on using the Trap Card to summon their boss monster, the theme may often struggle to play through multiple handtraps, particularly "[[Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring]]" and "[[Dominus Impulse]]" that can stop the summon entirely. Though this can be mitigated by combining the Deck with other engines to bait out the interruption.
