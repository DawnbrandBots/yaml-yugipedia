  "'''Metalmorph'''", known as "'''Metallization'''" (メタル{{Ruby|化|か}} ''Metaru-ka'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Trap Card]]s most notably used by [[Bandit Keith]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]]. "[[Metalmorph]]" is known for transforming monsters into '''Metal counterparts''', famously "[[Zoa]]" and "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]". It received its first support in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]'', more than two decades after the debut of the original "Metalmorph".

  "[[Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite]]" and "[[Metallizing Parasite - Soltite]]" are also members of this archetype in the ''OCG''; however, since support for this archetype only supports Trap Cards, this isn't an issue.

  == Design ==
  "[[Metalmorph]]" and its derivations have transformed a number of monsters into Metal versions of themselves in various media. The original context for this was that Bandit Keith (in the manga and anime) wished to trick [[Joey Wheeler]] into targeting his "Zoa" since, as a [[Fiend]] monster, it did not have the special properties of [[Machine]] monsters under the rules and gamestate of their [[Duelist Kingdom]] finals match. "Metalmorph", by turning "Zoa" into a Machine ("[[Metalzoa]]"), thus allowed Keith to entrap Joey. However, the latter countered by using Keith's gambits against him, turning "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]" into the more powerful "[[Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon]]".

  So far, except for the game-original "[[Metal Illusionist]]" and "[[Heavy Metal King]]", every Metal [[counterpart]] is one [[Level]] higher than its base form. This is due to them being upgraded forms, but their Levels are also equal to the their base forms' plus the Level (1) of "Metal Illusionist", which supports the archetype and is based on how "[[Copycat]]" was used to copy the aforementioned [[Trap Card]] both in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]].

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories]]'', "[[Metalmorph (FMR)|Metalmorph]]" is capable of transforming more cards into similar cards that have a metallic element to them, including "[[Baby Dragon (FMR)|Baby Dragon]]" into "[[Metal Dragon (FMR)|Metal Dragon]]" and "[[Jirai Gumo (FMR)|Jirai Gumo]]" into "[[Launcher Spider (FMR)|Launcher Spider]]".

  == Playstyle ==
  The core premises of the archetype involve sudden [[ATK]] increasing effects, [[Tributing]] non-Machine monsters for their Machine or metallic counterparts, and adding some protections to cards that did not previously have any. Many of the newer monsters associated with the archetype can be searched via their [[mention]] of "[[Max Metalmorph]]", with them in turn searching the "Metalmorph" Trap Cards. The oldest associated monsters instead have an unusual effect to summon themselves from the Main Deck, but playing those cards is not recommended, as they are bricks in the hand, require specific tributes, and are otherwise mediocre, even as beatsticks.
