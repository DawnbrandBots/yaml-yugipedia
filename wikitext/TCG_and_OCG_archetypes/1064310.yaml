  "'''Metalmorph'''", known as "'''Metallization'''" (メタル{{Ruby|化|か}} ''Metaru-ka'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Trap Card]]s most notably used by [[Bandit Keith]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]]. "[[Metalmorph]]" is known for transforming monsters into '''Metal counterparts''', famously "[[Zoa]]" and "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]". It received its first support in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]'', more than two decades after the debut of the original "Metalmorph".

  "[[Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite]]" and "[[Metallizing Parasite - Soltite]]" are also members of this archetype in the ''OCG''; however, since support for this archetype only works with Trap Cards, this isn't an issue.

  == Design ==
  "[[Metalmorph]]" and its derivations have transformed a number of monsters into Metal versions of themselves in various media. 

  In the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|manga]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]], during the [[Duelist Kingdom]] tournament, [[Machine]]-[[Type]] monsters are immune to Spell effects. In [[Joey Wheeler]] and [[Bandit Keith]]'s Duelist Kingdom Duel, Bandit Keith attempts to trick Joey into targeting his "Zoa" with Spells, since as a [[Fiend]]-Type monster, it was not immune to Spell Cards. Keith used the Trap Card "Metalmorph" to turn "Zoa" into a Machine ("[[Metalzoa]]"), thus giving it Spell immunity. However, Joey used "Copycat" to copy Keith's "Metalmorph", allowing him to likewise turn "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]" into a Machine ("[[Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon]]").

  So far, except for the game-original "[[Metal Illusionist]]", every Metal [[counterpart]] is one [[Level]] higher than its base form. While the other Metal counterparts represent their base form powered-up by "Metalmorph", "Metal Illusionist" instead represents how "[[Copycat]]" was used to copy "Metalmorph" in the .

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories]]'', "[[Metalmorph (FMR)|Metalmorph]]" is capable of transforming more cards into similar cards that have a metallic element to them, including "[[Baby Dragon (FMR)|Baby Dragon]]" into "[[Metal Dragon (FMR)|Metal Dragon]]" and "[[Jirai Gumo (FMR)|Jirai Gumo]]" into "[[Launcher Spider (FMR)|Launcher Spider]]".

  == Playstyle ==
  The core premises of the archetype involve sudden [[ATK]] increasing effects, [[Tributing]] non-Machine monsters for their Machine or metallic counterparts, and adding some protections to cards that did not previously have any. Many of the newer monsters associated with the archetype can be searched via their [[mention]] of "[[Max Metalmorph]]", with them in turn searching the "Metalmorph" Trap Cards. The oldest associated monsters instead have an unusual effect to summon themselves from the Main Deck, but playing those cards is not recommended, as they are bricks in the hand, require specific tributes, and are otherwise mediocre, even as beatsticks.

  The "Max Metalmorph" package, however, presents a reliable and effective engine when slotted into strategies that center around monster destruction and/or particular [[Types]] such as [[Fiend]] or [[Dragon]]. Not only is it possible to allow higher-[[Level]]ed monsters of the aforementioned types to "dodge" by tagging them out with "Max Metalmorph", but doing so also tags in additional tools/bosses in the forms of "[[Metalzoa X]]" for its on-Monster/Spell effect destruction (two of the most utilized/represented cards types in play) of an on-field monster, or "[[Red-Eyes Black Fullmetal Dragon]]" for its omni-negation and subsequent burn for an on-field monster's [[ATK]]. Couple this with associated monsters' common effect to remotely [[Set]] "Metalmorph" Traps and eliminate consistency issues, increasing the overall strength of the engine.
