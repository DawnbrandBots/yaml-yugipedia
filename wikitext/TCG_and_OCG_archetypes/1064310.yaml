  "'''Metalmorph'''", known as "'''Metallization'''" (メタル{{Ruby|化|か}} ''Metaru-ka'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Trap Card]]s most notably used by [[Bandit Keith]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]]. "[[Metalmorph]]" is known for transforming monsters into [[Metal counterpart]]s, famously "[[Zoa]]" and "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]".

  "[[Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite]]" and "[[Metallizing Parasite - Soltite]]" are also members of this archetype in the OCG; however, since support for this archetype only supports Trap Cards, this isn't an issue.

  == Design ==
  === Members ===
  "[[Metalmorph]]" and its derivations have transformed a number of monsters into [[Metal counterpart|Metal versions]] of themselves.
