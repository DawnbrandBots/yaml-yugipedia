  "'''Metalmorph'''", known as "'''Metallization'''" (メタル{{Ruby|化|か}} ''Metaru-ka'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Trap Card]]s based on [[Metalmorph|the eponymous card]] used by [[Bandit Keith]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' manga and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]], which is known for transforming monsters into what are popularly known as "Metal counterparts", most notably "[[Zoa]]" and "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]". It received its first support in ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]'', more than two decades after the debut of the original "Metalmorph".

  "[[Metallizing Parasite - Lunatite]]" and "[[Metallizing Parasite - Soltite]]" are also members of this archetype in the ''OCG''; however, since support for this archetype only interacts with Trap Cards, this isn't an issue.

  == Design ==
  "[[Metalmorph]]" and its derivations have transformed a number of monsters into Metal versions of themselves in various media. 

  During the [[Duelist Kingdom]] tournament of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|manga]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]], before the series switched to using concrete rules and effects, [[Machine]]-[[Type]] monsters had immunity to Spell effects and so-called "magical attacks" as an innate trait. In [[Joey Wheeler]] and [[Bandit Keith]]'s Duel, the latter attempted to trick the former into targeting his [[Fiend]]-Type "Zoa" with Spells, before he used "Metalmorph" to turn it into a Machine ("[[Metalzoa]]"), thus giving it Spell immunity. However, Joey used "[[Copycat]]" to copy Keith's "Metalmorph", allowing him to likewise turn his "[[Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]" into a Machine ("[[Red-Eyes Black Metal Dragon]]"). Of note, the anime version of this Duel had "Metalmorph" renamed to "[[Magic Metal Force]]", possibly to avoid confusion over the real-life version of the card having been printed with a different effect before the episodes in question aired. Despite this, other appearances of the card used the original name.

  A similar card to the anime/manga version of "Metalmorph", "[[Metal Plus]]", was used by the [[Nightshroud]]-possessed [[Atticus Rhodes]] during his second Duel with [[Jaden Yuki]] to turn "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon]]" into "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon]]". However, the printed version of the latter was given a completely different effect, turning it into a stand-alone card with no connection to this archetype aside from the name.

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories]]'', "[[Metalmorph (FMR)|Metalmorph]]" is capable of transforming other miscellaneous monsters into similar mechanic ones that are unrelated to it in other media, such as "[[Baby Dragon (FMR)|Baby Dragon]]" to "[[Metal Dragon (FMR)|Metal Dragon]]" and "[[Jirai Gumo (FMR)|Jirai Gumo]]" to "[[Launcher Spider (FMR)|Launcher Spider]]".

  === Metal counterparts ===
  So far, every Metal [[counterpart]] is 1 [[Level]] higher than its base form, except for the game-original "[[Metal Illusionist]]". This might be because in contrast to the other Metal counterparts representing their base form powered up by "Metalmorph", "Metal Illusionist" instead references "[[Copycat]]" copying "Metalmorph".

  Two special cases also exist; "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon]]" and "[[Red-Eyes Flare Metal Dragon]]", who are the Metal counterparts of "[[Red-Eyes Darkness Dragon]]" (transformed by "[[Metal Plus]]") and "[[Red-Eyes Black Flare Dragon]]" (combined with "[[Black Metal Dragon]]") respectively but are unrelated to the "Metalmorph" archetype and are not Machine monsters.

  == Playstyle ==
  The core premises of the archetype involve sudden [[ATK]] increasing effects, [[Tributing]] non-Machine monsters for their Machine or metallic counterparts, and adding some protections to cards that did not previously have any. Many of the newer monsters associated with the archetype can be searched via their [[mention]] of "[[Max Metalmorph]]", with them in turn searching the "Metalmorph" Trap Cards. The oldest associated monsters instead have an unusual effect to summon themselves from the Main Deck, but playing those cards is not recommended as they are bricks in the hand, require specific tributes, and are mediocre even as [[List of unofficial terms|beatsticks]].

  The "Max Metalmorph" package, instead, presents a reliable and effective [[List of unofficial terms|engine]] when included in strategies that center around monster destruction and/or particular [[Type]]s (such as [[Fiend]]). Not only it is possible to allow high-[[Level]] monsters of the aforementioned types to "dodge" by tagging them out with "Max Metalmorph", but doing so also tags in additional tools/bosses in the forms of "[[Metalzoa X]]" for its on-Monster/Spell effect destruction (two of the most utilized/represented cards types in play) of an on-field monster, or "[[Red-Eyes Black Fullmetal Dragon]]" for its omni-negation and subsequent burn for an on-field monster's [[ATK]]. Couple this with the archetypal monsters' shared effect to remotely [[Set]] "Metalmorph" Traps and eliminate consistency issues, increasing the overall strength of the engine. Adding to the consistency is "[[Metalflame Swordsman]]", whom not only aids by replacing itself in-hand with an archetypal "Max Metalmorph" card, but also acting as a snowballing beater and [[Effect damage|burn]] dealer with each opponent's card/effect resolution while on-field.

  Among the Decks which can especially utilize the "Max Metalmorph" engine is the de facto "Dragon Link" build, given not only its local usage of tools like "Black Metal Dragon" whom can be enabled for a double-search by using it as Link Material for "[[Striker Dragon]]", but also the wide plethora of high-level Dragon monsters that would benefit from the added "dodging" capabilities afforded by the engine's Traps. "[[Unchained]]" stands out as well not just for its usage of Fiend monsters but also its predisposition for monster destruction which "Metalzoa X" can undoubtedly aid in.

  The engine can also see use alongside an "[[Armored Xyz (archetype)|Armored Xyz]]" package within allowing [[Level]]s/[[Rank]]s among a Deck's monsters, given the latter package's "[[Full Armored Dark Knight Lancer]]" can benefit from its effect to attach an opponent's monster to itself being able to activate at [[Spell Speed 2]] by way of the "Metalmorph" Traps equipping themselves to monsters at such effect speed.
