  "'''Numeron'''" (ヌメロン, ''Numeron'') is an [[archetype]] used by [[Yuma Tsukumo]] and [[Don Thousand]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime, based on the [[Numeron Code]].

  The two "Numeron" [[Spell Card]]s that Yuma uses focus on [[Xyz Evolution]], being used to Summon "[[Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory (anime)|Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory]]" and "[[Number 39: Utopia Roots (anime)|Number 39: Utopia Roots]]". He also has "[[Number 100: Numeron Dragon (anime)|Number 100: Numeron Dragon]]", after obtaining it from [[Mizar]].

  The cards that Don Thousand uses mainly revolve around activating during the opponent's turn from the [[hand]] or even the [[Deck]], and are described as holding the power of the Numeron Code, being able to "rewrite" the opponent's cards and increase their own [[ATK]] to extremely high levels.
  The "[[Numerounius]]" archetype can be considered an upgrade to this archetype, containing related monsters with even higher ATK and stronger effects.

  ==Members==
  Cards based on members of this archetype were used in [[Boss Duel]], a special type of Duel performed in Japan during a Yu-Gi-Oh! Day event:

  ==Playing style==
  The main strategy of "Numeron" Decks involves using "[[Numeron Calling]]" to Special Summon up to 4 "Numeron Gate" Xyz Monsters to perform an [[OTK]]. Each "Numeron Gate" monster has an effect to double the ATK of all of them when they battle an opponent's monster, giving them a potential ATK increase of up to 16,000 with their effect alone.

  "[[Numeron Network]]" can copy the effect of "[[Numeron Calling]]" to accomplish this, with "Network" itself being searchable by "[[Numeron Wall]]" during either player's turn, provided they control no other cards (barring copies of "Wall" itself). "[[Memories of Hope]]" can be used to draw up to 4 cards after activating "Numeron Calling", giving you massive hand advantage, helped by the Deck being able to thin itself by a few cards prior, thus allowing better access to board-breakers and powerful [[staple]]s. "[[Kaiju]]" monsters were an ideal choice to remove an opponent's monster and acts as a "target" for the "Numeron" monsters to attack into.

  ==Weaknesses==
  * The Deck has a generally poor board presence (outside of a Link Summon using the "Numeron" Xyz Monsters) and relatively few disruption choices during the opponent's turn, as its strategy focuses on clearing the opponent's field of threats for its OTK attempt.

  * "[[Numeron Network]]" is pivotal to this Deck's strategy, since its effects allow easy access to the effect of "Numeron Calling" and (more importantly) enable the effects of the "Numeron" Xyz Monsters. While it can be more effective to Chain some form of card removal to the activated effect of "Network" (thus preventing the Field Spell's effect from resolving and Special Summoning the "Numeron" monsters), especially since the activated effect of "Network" can only be used once per turn, it can still be effective to eliminate the Field Spell during the Battle Phase in order to prevent the "Numeron" Xyz Monsters from activating their ATK-doubling effects.
  ** Effective [[hand trap]]s include "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]" and "[[Veidos the Eruption Dragon of Extinction]]".
  ** If "Numeron Network" is eliminated either before its effect is activated, or before the Battle Phase is entered, the "Numeron" player is still capable of activating another copy to proceed with their strategy.

  * Cards such as "[[Macro Cosmos]]" can shut off the Deck entirely, as "Numeron Network" will not be able to send any copies of "Calling" from the Deck to the GY (thus requiring the "Numeron" player to actually activate "Numeron Calling" from their hand/field), and "[[Numeron Wall]]" won't be able to activate its effect to activate "Numeron Network" from the Deck.

  * "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" can be somewhat effective against this Deck, since "[[Numeron Calling]]" Special Summons up to 4 monsters. If "[[Planet Pathfinder]]" or a "[[Kaiju]]" monster was already Summoned during the Main Phase 1, or "[[Number C1: Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya]]" or a Link Monster is Special Summoned during the Main Phase 2, this can render the "Numeron" player vulnerable to its effect.

  * "[[Numeron Calling]]" requires the "Numeron" player to control no monsters in order to activate it. Therefore, they can be hampered by their opponent forcing them to control a monster, such as via "[[D.D. Guide]]" or "[[Silent Wobby]]".
  ** This can potentially be overcome by the "Numeron" player entering their Battle Phase prematurely to attack with that monster and have it be destroyed by battle. However, the opponent can counter this by either controlling no monsters or only Defense Position monsters, although the latter situation still is vulnerable to a "Kaiju" Special Summon.
