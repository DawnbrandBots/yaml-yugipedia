  "'''Numeron'''" (ヌメロン, ''Numeron'') is an [[archetype]] used by [[Yuma Tsukumo]] and [[Don Thousand]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime, based on the [[Numeron Code]].

  The two "Numeron" [[Spell Card]]s that Yuma uses focus on [[Xyz Evolution]], being used to Summon "[[Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory (anime)|Number C39: Utopia Ray Victory]]" and "[[Number 39: Utopia Roots (anime)|Number 39: Utopia Roots]]". He also has "[[Number 100: Numeron Dragon (anime)|Number 100: Numeron Dragon]]", after obtaining it from [[Mizar]].

  The cards that Don Thousand uses mainly revolve around activating during the opponent's turn from the [[hand]] or even the [[Deck]], and are described as holding the power of the Numeron Code, being able to "rewrite" the opponent's cards and increase their own [[ATK]] to extremely high levels.
  The "[[Numerounius]]" archetype can be considered an upgrade to this archetype, containing related monsters with even higher ATK and stronger effects.

  == Members ==
  Cards based on members of this archetype were used in [[Boss Duel]], a special type of Duel performed in Japan during a Yu-Gi-Oh! Day event:

  == Playing style ==
  "Numeron" is a blind second [[OTK]] Deck, using "[[Numeron Network]]" (copying the effect of "[[Numeron Calling]]") to Special Summon up to 4 "Numeron Gate" Xyz Monsters to perform an [[OTK]]. Each "Numeron Gate" monster has an effect to double the ATK of all of them when they battle an opponent's monster, giving them a potential ATK increase of up to 16,000 with their effect alone. When going first, or if the "Numeron Gate" monsters fail to perform an OTK, they can be used to summon powerful Extra Deck monsters such as "[[Infinitrack Fortress Megaclops]]", "[[Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax]]", or "[[Number C1: Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya]]".

  "[[Memories of Hope]]" can be used to draw up to 4 cards after activating the effect of "Numeron Calling", giving you massive hand advantage, helped by the Deck being able to thin itself by a few cards prior, thus allowing better access to board-breakers and powerful [[staple]]s. "[[Kaiju]]" monsters were an ideal choice to remove an opponent's monster while acting as a "target" for the "Numeron" monsters to attack into.

  == Weaknesses ==
  * As a blind second Deck, it has a poor board presence (only 1 summon is allowed after using "Calling") when going first.
  * "[[Numeron Network]]" is pivotal to this Deck's strategy; if it isn't on field, the "Numeron Gates" cannot activate their doubling effects. Remove "Network" when it activates its effect, or during the Battle Phase, when it cannot be replaced.
  ** Effective [[hand trap]]s include "[[Ghost Ogre & Snow Rabbit]]" and "[[Veidos the Eruption Dragon of Extinction]]".
  * "Numeron Network" sends the card it copies to the GY as cost, so unless "Numeron Calling" is hard drawn, the Deck is shut down by "[[Dimension Shifter]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]".
  * Anti-Battle Phase cards like "[[Threatening Roar]]" and "[[Sangenpai Transcendent Dragion]]" prevent the "Gates" from activating their doubling effects.
  * "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" can be somewhat effective against this Deck, since "Numeron Calling" Special Summons up to 4 monsters. If "[[Planet Pathfinder]]" or a "[[Kaiju]]" monster was already Summoned during the Main Phase 1, or "[[Number C1: Numeron Chaos Gate Sunya]]" or a Link Monster is Special Summoned during the Main Phase 2, this can render the "Numeron" player vulnerable to its effect.
  * "[[Numeron Calling]]" requires the "Numeron" player to control no monsters in order to activate it. Therefore, they can be hampered by their opponent forcing them to control a monster, such as via "[[Ken the Warrior Dragon]]", "[[Gen the Diamond Tiger]], or "[[Silent Wobby]]".
  ** This can potentially be overcome by the "Numeron" player entering their Battle Phase prematurely to attack with that monster and have it be destroyed by battle. However, the opponent can counter this by either controlling no monsters or only Defense Position monsters, although the latter situation still is vulnerable to a "Kaiju" Special Summon.
