  "'''Frog'''" (ガエル ''Gaeru'') is an [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Aqua]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Cybernetic Revolution]]''. This was both the first WATER archetype and the first Aqua archetype. The archetype is used by [[Princess Rose]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. The "[[Toad]]" series is a related series of monsters that support the "Frog" archetype.

  "[[Froggy Forcefield]]" is not a member of this archetype, as its name does not contain「ガエル」.

  == Design ==
  True to their their name, the general design of "Frog" as well as the related "Toad" monsters resemble their real-life counterparts. Some "Frog" monsters like "[[Flip Flop Frog]]" and "[[Poison Draw Frog]]" showcase their long, sticky tongues in their artwork. Most of the "Frog" and Toad monsters have distinctive colorful markings on their bodies and heads, most notably "[[Swap Frog]]", "[[Dupe Frog]]", "[[Beelze Frog]]", and "[[Ronintoadin]]".

  Some "Frog" and Toad monsters resemble angels like "[[Treeborn Frog]]", while others resemble demons like "Beelze Frog" and "Swap Frog". This thematic resemblance to angels and demons is further highlighted by the contrasting half-angel, half-demon appearances of "[[Substitoad]]" and "[[Tradetoad]]".

  === Etymology ===
  The Japanese name of the "Frog" archetype, ''gaeru'', is the [[wikipedia:Rendaku|voiced]] form of the word for "frog", ''kaeru''; ''kaeru'' in turn is used in the Japanese names of the Toad monsters. Most ''[[TCG]]'' languages localize ''gaeru'' as "frog" and ''kaeru'' as "toad" in their own languages. In Portuguese, however, the reverse is true: "Frog" is translated as "Sapo" ("toad"), while "Toad" is translated as "Rã" ("frog").

  In the Japanese, the names of "Frog" and Toad monsters are puns on ''gaeru''/''kaeru'', primarily exploiting the fact that many verbs in Japanese end in one of those sequences.

  == Playing style ==
  Though they have weak stats, "Frog" monsters are versatile: their effects include rapid Summoning, the option to increase their ATK or protect themselves from destruction, and wiping out all cards the opponent controls with "[[Des Croaking]]".

  === Pure Deck ===
  ''[[Frog FTK]]'' was a fearsome strategy that relied on "[[Substitoad]]", "[[Ronintoadin]]", and a burn card like "[[Mass Driver]]" to deal effect damage. However, after it won the ''2010 World Championships'', "Substitoad" was [[Forbidden]], gutting the FTK.

  Afterwards, "pure" Frog decks became uncommon. An OTK deck revolving around "[[Des Croaking]]" had some rogue success. A popular card to include was "[[Sea Lancer]]", which allowed recycling Frogs that were banished by Ronintoadin.

  In Edison - a pre-"[[Ronintoadin]]" format - there exists Fishborg Frog, a relatively new invention that takes advantage of "[[Substitoad]]" and "[[Fishborg Blaster]]". It is able to perform big [[Synchro]] combos to perform an [[OTK]] and/or end on the "[[Dupe Frog]]" attack lock.

  === Frog Engine ===
  Frogs were often used in other decks as an engine:
  * Before "[[Monarch]]" monsters gained dedicated support, Frog monsters like "Treeborn Frog", "Swap Frog" and "Ronintoadin" were often used as Tribute fodder.
  * In 2016, "Frogs" gained a boss monster in "[[Toadally Awesome]]": a soft once per turn omni-negate that steals the negated card. Level 2 Decks, namely "[[Paleozoic]]" and later "[[Spright]]", often ran "[[Swap Frog]]" and "[[Ronintoadin]]" (if legal) to summon it. Spright's dominance in the metagame lead to "Toadally Awesome" being banned in the OCG, while "Ronintoadin" was banned in the TCG.

  === Weaknesses ===
  Cards such as "[[Zombie World]]" can be used to prevent "Toadally Awesome" from being Summoned. Card effects that banish cards that would be sent to the Graveyard, such as "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]" and "[[Dimensional Fissure]]", greatly hamper the strategies of "Frog" Decks.
