  "'''Toon'''" (トゥーン ''Tūn'') is an [[archetype]] of cards used by [[Maximillion Pegasus]].
  All [[Toon monster]]s are "Toon" cards—including "[[Manga Ryu-Ran]]", because it has 「トゥーン」 in its Japanese name. "[[Toon Alligator]]" is the only monster of this archetype that is not also a Toon monster.

  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  Each "Toon" monster (with the exception of "[[Toon Alligator]]") is a highly exaggerated [[wikipedia:Cartoon|cartoon]] [[wikipedia:Caricature|caricature]] of another monster.

  In the original manga and anime series, Toon monsters are simply the original monsters after being transformed by "[[Toon World (manga)|Toon World]]". After they appeared as separate cards in the ''OCG'', Toon monsters appeared as separate cards in the anime as well.

  ===Members===
  Based on their effect patterns and debut date, "Toon" monsters can be divided into several types of designs.

  ; Special Summon-only Monster (Toon World Required)
  These are the original Toon monsters. They all share the following effect:
  * Cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. Must first be Special Summoned (from your hand) by Tributing [the same amount of monsters as required for a [[Tribute Summon]] of a monster with its original Level], while you control "[[Toon World]]".
  * Cannot attack the turn it is Special Summoned.
  * You must pay 500 LP to declare an attack with this monster.
  * If "Toon World" on the field is destroyed, destroy this card.
  * Can attack your opponent directly, unless they control a Toon monster, in which case this card must target a Toon monster for its attacks.

  ==Playing style==
  "Toon" is a Beatdown-style Deck that focuses on making direct attacks and having "[[Toon Kingdom]]" (or "[[Toon World]]") on the field.

  "[[Toon Kingdom]]" is essential for the Deck. It banishes 3 cards face-down when activated, but treats itself as "Toon World" protects Toons from targeting and destruction effects. "[[Toon Table of Contents|Table of Contents]]" (searches any "Toon" card) and "[[Toon Bookmark|Bookmark]]" (searches "Toon World" or a card that mentions it) are the main ways to search it.

  Key monsters include:
  * "[[Toon Gemini Elf|Gemini Elf]]" and "[[Toon Masked Sorcerer|Masked Sorcerer]]" are hand control. They can't attack the turn they are summoned, but "Gemini Elf" forces the opponent to discard if it deals damage, "Masked Sorcerer" draws a card if it deals battle damage.
  * "[[Toon Black Luster Soldier|Black Luster Soldier]]" and "[[Toon Harpie Lady|Harpie Lady]]" are the main board breakers. "Black Luster Soldier" requires Tributing 8 levels of Toon monster, and banishes a monster on field. "Harpie Lady" summons itself if "Toon World" is on the field and destroys a Spell/Trap if you have another Toon monster.
  * "[[Red-Eyes Toon Dragon]]" and "[[Toon Dark Magician|Dark Magician]]" are the main ways to Special Summon. "Red-Eyes" summons a Toon from hand, while "Dark Magician" either summons a Toon from Deck (ignoring conditions) or searches a "Toon" Spell/Trap.  However, since they cannot Special Summon themselves, they require a card like "[[Toon Page-Flip]]" or "[[The Black Stone of Legend]]" to get on the field.

  "[[Toon Page-Flip|Page-Flip]]" is currently one of the best ways to get high Level Toons on the field: it randomly Special Summons one of three chosen "Toon" monsters (ignoring its summoning conditions). Other useful Spells/Traps include cards like [[Mimicat]], [[Comic Hand]], [[Toon Terror]], and [[Toon Briefcase]], which have generically strong effects but require "Toon World" / a Toon monster to be used.

  The archetype does not use the Extra Deck, but it can run various Xyz Monsters, such as making Rank 7 monsters with "Red-Eyes Toon Dragon" and/or "Toon Dark Magician". 

  Because "Toon Table of Contents" can search itself, it was often used in [[FTK]] Decks as a [[Deck thinner]], while acting as a spell for "[[Royal Magical Library]]" or "[[Magical Explosion]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The archetype is very reliant on having "[[Toon World]]" on field. Many cards require it in order be to activated/summoned, and most of the older Toon monsters are destroyed when "Toon World" is destroyed.
  ** While the archetype has many ways to search, because a search is often needed for "Toon Kingdom", they cannot be used to get any other power cards.
  ** Cards like "Toon Bookmark", "[[Stardust Dragon]]", "[[Starlight Road]]", "[[Dark Bribe]]", "[[Card Guard]]", and "[[Solemn Judgment]]" can negate card destruction effects.
  * In its current state, the archetype is slow compared to modern competitive Decks. 
  ** Few monsters can Special Summon themselves or other monsters. Monsters that Special Summon themselves (like "[[Toon Dark Magician Girl]]" and "[[Toon Black Luster Soldier]]") tend to require Tributes to do so, while those that Special Summon others (namely "[[Red-Eyes Toon Dragon]]" and "[[Toon Dark Magician]]") cannot Special Summon themselves. "Toon Page-Flip" helps in this regard, though it is random.
  ** Most of the high level monsters are dead draws.
