  "'''Toon'''" (トゥーン ''Tūn'') is an [[archetype]] of cards used by [[Maximillion Pegasus]].
  All [[Toon monster]]s are "Toon" cards—including "[[Manga Ryu-Ran]]", because it has 「トゥーン」 in its Japanese name. "[[Toon Alligator]]" is the only monster of this archetype that is not also a Toon monster.

  ==Design==
  ===Appearance===
  Each "Toon" monster (with the exception of "[[Toon Alligator]]") is a highly exaggerated [[wikipedia:Cartoon|cartoon]] [[wikipedia:Caricature|caricature]] of another monster.

  In the original manga and anime series, Toon monsters are simply the original monsters after being transformed by "[[Toon World (manga)|Toon World]]". After they appeared as separate cards in the ''OCG'', Toon monsters appeared as separate cards in the anime as well.

  ===Members===
  Based on their effect patterns, "Toon" monsters can be divided into several types of designs.

  ; Special Summon-only Monster (Toon World Required)
  Shared effects:
  * Cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. Must first be Special Summoned (from your hand) by Tributing [the same amount of monsters as required for a [[Tribute Summon]] of a monster with its original Level], while you control "[[Toon World]]".
  * Cannot attack the turn it is Special Summoned.
  * You must pay 500 LP to declare an attack with this monster.
  * If "Toon World" on the field is destroyed, destroy this card.
  * Can attack your opponent directly, unless they control a Toon monster, in which case this card must target a Toon monster for its attacks.

  ==Playing style==
  "Toon" is a Beatdown-style Deck that focuses on making direct attacks and having "Toon World" (or the retrain "[[Toon Kingdom]]") on the field.

  * "[[Toon Kingdom]]" treats itself as "Toon World" on the field, while preventing Toon monsters from being targeted and protecting them from destruction.
  * "[[Toon Table of Contents]]" and "[[Toon Bookmark]]" are the main consistency tools, with "Table of Contents" searching any "Toon" card, and "Bookmark" searching any card that mentions "Toon World".
  * "[[Toon Page-Flip]]" randomly Special Summons one of three chosen "Toon" monsters, ignoring its summoning conditions, acting as one of the best ways to get high Level monsters on the field.
  * "[[Toon Gemini Elf]]" and "[[Toon Masked Sorcerer]]" can maintain hand control; when dealing damage, "Gemini Elf" forces the opponent to discard a card, and "Masked Sorcerer" lets you draw a card.
  * "[[Red-Eyes Toon Dragon]]" and "[[Toon Dark Magician]]" can Special Summon a Toon from hand / Deck (respectively), ignoring its Summoning conditions. However, since they cannot Special Summon themselves, they require a card like "[[Toon Page-Flip]]" or "[[The Black Stone of Legend]]" to get on the field.
  * "[[Toon Black Luster Soldier]]" and "[[Toon Harpie Lady]]" can Special Summon themselves if "Toon World" is on the field, and act as removal.
  * "[[Mimicat]]", "[[Comic Hand]]", "[[Toon Terror]]", and "[[Toon Briefcase]]" offer generically powerful effects, but require "Toon World" on the field, and can be searched by in-archetype.

  The archetype does not use the Extra Deck, but it can run various Xyz Monsters, such as making Rank 7 monsters with "Red-Eyes Toon Dragon" and/or "Toon Dark Magician". 

  Because "Toon Table of Contents" can search itself, it was often used in [[FTK]] Decks as a [[Deck thinner]], while acting as a spell for "[[Royal Magical Library]]" or "[[Magical Explosion]]".

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The archetype is very reliant on "[[Toon World]]". Many cards require it in order be to activated/summoned, and most of the older Toon monsters are destroyed when "Toon World" is destroyed.
  ** Cards like "[[Stardust Dragon]]", "[[Starlight Road]]", "[[Dark Bribe]]", "[[Card Guard]]", and "[[Solemn Judgment]]" can negate card destruction effects.
  * In its current state, the archetype is very slow for the modern game. Few monsters can Special Summon themselves, and those that do (like "[[Toon Dark Magician Girl]]" and "[[Toon Black Luster Soldier]]") often require Tributes to do so. This makes it reliant on the random "[[Toon Page-Flip]]" to get starters and boss monsters out. Even then, it has a hard time making a board of disruptions or getting enough ATK to [[OTK]].
  ** Most of the high level monsters are dead draws.
