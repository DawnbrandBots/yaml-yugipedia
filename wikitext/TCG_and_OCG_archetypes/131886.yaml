  "'''Karakuri'''" (カラクリ ''Karakuri'') is an [[archetype]] of [[EARTH]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Starstrike Blast]]'', though its first member, "[[Karakuri Spider]]", debuted well before the rest of the archetype.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Master Duel card storylines#Studying the Origins of the Karakuri}}

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  The "Karakuri" monsters resemble wooden mechanized puppets or automata from Japan from the 17th century to 19th century. They are fashioned like characters from feudal Japan.

  === Etymology ===
  The word "''[[wikipedia:Karakuri ningyo|karakuri]]''" means a "''mechanical device to tease, trick, or take a person by surprise''". Like [[Wind-Up]] toys, they could only move in a predetermined pattern - this is reflected by the cards' effects, as they do not have a choice about whether they attack or defend. 

  Most of them have names that are made up of [[wikipedia:Japanese numerals|Japanese numerals]], often the Japanese ''daiji'' 「大字」 or [[wikipedia:Japanese numerals#Formal numbers|Formal numbers]] are used. Multiplying the first 2 numbers in their names will give out the last number, excluding "[[Karakuri Barrel mdl 96 "Shinkuro"]]". The readings of some of the "Karakuris'" names also have English meanings relating to their role (Ninja, Muso, etc). For example, "[[Karakuri Ninja mdl 919 "Kuick"]]" can be pronounced as 'quick'. "[[Karakuri Barrel mdl 96 "Shinkuro"]]" can be pronounced as '[[Synchro Monster|Synchro]]', "[[Karakuri Muso mdl 818 "Haipa"]]" can be pronounced as 'Hyper' and "[[Karakuri Steel Shogun mdl 00X "Bureido"]]" can be pronounced as 'Blade'.

  Notably, the combined [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] of all "Karakuri" Synchro Monsters equal 4500.

  == Playing style ==
  "Karakuri" is a Synchro-based combo archetype which revolves around changing positions. Most Main Deck monsters must attack if able, and have effects to change positions. Meanwhile, the Synchros can each Special Summon a "Karakuri" from Deck (''which is not a hard [[once per turn]]'') and mainly have effects that trigger when a "Karakuri" monster changes position.

  As an EARTH Machine archetype, it can be combined with other such archetypes. In the past, it could be used with "[[Geargia]]". More recently, it can be used with archetypes like "[[Superheavy Samurai]]". Also, as an EARTH Synchro archetype, it can access the "[[Naturia]]" Synchros (unless locked to Machines with the effect of "[[Karakuri Bonze mdl 9763 "Kunamzan"|Bonze Kunamzan]]").

  ===Original===
  The archetype can be split into two waves of cards:
  * The original cards released in 2010-2011.
  * Legacy support released in ''[[Ignition Assault]]'' (2020).

  Historically, extenders - such as "[[Iron Call]]", "[[Instant Fusion]]", "[[Emergency Teleport]]", "[[Solar Wind Jammer]]", and "[[De-Synchro]]" - were crucial to help swarm the field with Synchros. "Emergency Teleport" in particular could be used since none of the Synchros had a requirement for their Tuner, and none of the monsters had an archetype lock, forming a build known as "Teleport Karakuri".

  ===Legacy Support===

  * As a Machine Deck, it is countered by "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" and "[[System Down]]".

  == Trivia ==
  * The "Karakuri" archetype's debut in ''[[Starstrike Blast]] ''seems to be equivalent to the "[[Scrap]]" archetype's debut in ''[[Duelist Revolution]]''. Their [[Synchro Monster]]s have been released in [[Ultra Rare|Ultra]] and [[Ultimate Rare]] ("[[Karakuri Shogun mdl 00 "Burei"]]" and "[[Karakuri Steel Shogun mdl 00X "Bureido"]]"), one of their monsters and support cards are [[Super Rare]]s ("[[Karakuri Ninja mdl 339 "Sazank"]]" and "[[Karakuri Klock]]"), and the rest are [[Common]] and [[Rare]].
  * The "mdl" in the "Karakuri" monsters' English names is an abbreviation of "Model", i.e. "Karakuri Merchant Model #177 "Inashichi"" is "[[Karakuri Merchant mdl 177 "Inashichi"]]". The first two model numbers of all "Karakuri" [[Effect Monster]]s, except for "Karakuri Barrel MDL 96", give out the third and fourth when multiplied together.
  * The cloth flaps attached to most of the "Karakuri" monsters are called [[wikipedia:Shide (Shinto)|Shide]].
