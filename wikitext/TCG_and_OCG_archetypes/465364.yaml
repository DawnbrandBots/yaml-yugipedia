  "'''Subterror'''" (サブテラー ''Sabuterā'') is an archetype of [[EARTH]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that first appeared in ''[[The Dark Illusion]]''. It is one of two formerly ''[[TCG-only|TCG-exclusive]]'' archetypes that premiered in that set, the other being the "[[SPYRAL]]". The archetype includes a sub-archetype called "[[Subterror Behemoth]]".

  == Etymology ==
  The high-Level "[[Subterror Behemoth]]" are comprised of colossal beasts whose names are a reference to subterranean anomalies or types of rock (''TCG''), or bodies of water in the [[wikipedia:Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean Sea]] (''OCG''). "[[Subterror Fiendess]]" is the humanoid form of "[[Subterror Behemoth Fiendess]]", and "[[Subterror Guru]]" appears to be related to "[[Subterror Behemoth Speleogeist]]", as they have similarly-patterned legs and tails.

  The ''OCG'' name of "Subterror Behemoth" is "Subterror Malice", which is a pun on the Latin genitive singular case for "sea", ''maris''. The ''OCG'' epithet of "[[The Hidden City]]", 地中界 (''Chichūkai'', lit. "world within earth"), is a pun on the Japanese name for the Mediterranean Sea itself, 地中海 (''Chichūkai'', lit. "sea within earth"). "Mediterranean" originates from the Latin word ''[[wiktionary:mediterraneus|Mediterraneus]]'', meaning "in the middle of the land", referring to the Mediterranean Sea being completely enclosed by Europe and Africa. However, 地中 can also mean "''sub''terranean" as well, so it is possible that "Subterror Malice" was intended as a wordplay on "Sub Terra Maris" ("underground sea").

  ==Playing style==
  "Subterror" is a [[Flip monster|Flip]]-focused archetype consisting of high-Level Flip monsters (the "[[Subterror Behemoth]]" monsters) with high-power Flip effects, and low-Level monsters that support Flip mechanics.
  All Main Deck "Subterror Behemoth" monsters share the following effects in addition to their [[Flip effect]]:
  * ''When a [[face-up]] [[Monster Card|monster]] you control is flipped [[face-down]], if you control no face-up monsters: You can [[Special Summon]] this card from your [[hand]] in [[Defense Position]].'' 
  * ''Once per turn: You can change this card to face-down Defense Position.''
  The combination of these effects means that if the player has multiple "Subterror Behemoth" monsters in their hand, and flips a face-up monster they control face-down so that they control no face-up monsters, they can Special Summon 1 "Subterror Behemoth" monster in their hand and then flip it face-down to summon another one, eventually summoning all of them.

  |}

  The low-Level "Subterror" monsters, as well as their Spell/Traps, function as support for the "Subterror Behemoth" monsters, providing searching, recovery, and other forms of protection to "Subterror" monsters. The most important member among them is "[[Subterror Guru]]", a Flip-based "Subterror" searcher, who also has a (conditionally [[Quick Effect|Quick]]) effect to flip itself and another monster face-down, instantly setting up the summon requirements of "Subterror Behemoth" monsters. For the other members, the important members are "[[Subterror Fiendess]]", an omni-negate handtrap, "[[Subterror Nemesis Warrior]]", a situational searcher, and "[[Subterror Nemesis Archer]]", a situational removal and monster searcher.

  "Subterror" Spell/Trap support round out the deck with more utility. For Spells, the Field Spell "[[The Hidden City]]" provides monster searching, extra flip-up, and battle protection; it can be used to search "Guru" and immediately flip it for another search. The Continuous Spell "[[Subterror Cave Clash]]" provides GY recovery.

  For Traps, "[[Subterror Behemoth Burrowing]]" provides protection and a flip-down GY effect, "[[Subterror Succession]]" is a (technically generic) reusable trap that can exchange low-Level "Subterror" support monsters for high-Level "Subterror" flip monsters (and vice versa), and "[[Subterror Final Battle]]" is a reusable trap with four different effects: flip-up, flip-down, stat boosting, and protection against effect negation.

  ===Guru Control===
  Guru Control is a variant of the "Subterror" playstyle focusing exclusively on "[[Subterror Guru]]", and plays few to no "Subterror Behemoth" monsters. In Guru Control, the only "Subterror" monsters played are "[[Subterror Guru]]", "[[Subterror Fiendess]]", "[[Subterror Nemesis Archer]]", and optionally, "[[Subterror Behemoth Umastryx]]".

  "Guru" serves as the Deck's central engine card; by searching out "Guru", then repeatedly flipping it in both players' turns with "Subterror" card effects, the Deck can quickly search out its key cards and gain an overwhelming card advantage over a few turns. The primary search targets for "Guru" are "[[Subterror Fiendess|Fiendess]]" and "[[Subterror Final Battle|Final Battle]]", who provide omni-negates and wide-range utility respectively. Secondarily, "[[Subterror Nemesis Archer|Nemesis Archer]]" and "[[Subterror Behemoth Umastryx|Umastryx]]" are searchable pieces of removal, and "[[Subterror Cave Clash|Cave Clash]]" is another searchable recursion point.

  Typically, Guru Control Decks are supplemented by large amounts of staple traps and [[floodgate]]s, most prominently "[[Crackdown]]" (as "Guru" can flip the taken monster face-down, giving the player full control over the monster once it's flipped face-up again) and "[[There Can Be Only One]]" (due to the archetype's multi-type nature).
