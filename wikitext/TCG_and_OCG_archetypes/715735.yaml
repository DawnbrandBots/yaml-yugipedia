  {{Quote|The archetype's tagline in promotional material|This is the story of the "beginning".}}
  "'''Magistus'''" (マギストス ''Magisutosu'') is an [[archetype]] of monsters with various [[Type]]s (primarily [[Spellcaster]]) and [[Attribute]]s which debuted in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Genesis Impactors]]''. It is the second theme featured in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Stories]]'' manga.

  == Etymology ==
  ''Magistus'' is based on [[wikipedia:Hermes Trismegistus|Hermes Trismegistus]], the purported author of the [[wikipedia:Hermetica|Hermetic Corpus]], a series of sacred texts that are the basis of [[wikipedia:Hermeticism|Hermeticism]]. The word "magistus" itself is a portmanteau of "magi" and "mégistos" (Greek: μέγιστος; Romanized as "megistus"), meaning "magicians" and "greatest".

  In Japanese, a large number of "Magistus" monsters feature titles that contain ''gikun'' stylized readings, with a non-Japanese name reading (that includes "Magistus") applied to a Japanese ''kanji'' name.

  In Japanese, many of the "core" monsters include the "aspect" of their related Magistus magician in their ''kanji'' title (Lawbook, Absolute Flame, Crystal, or Sacred Magic); this naming convention is not present in their TCG names.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Magistus (arc)}}

  == Design ==
  "Magistus" revolves around four magician characters (monster cards) who form the titular magician group, whose detailed lore is depicted (after the theme's initial release) in the [[Magistus (arc)|Magistus story arc]] of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Stories]]''. Three of four are key members of three pre-existing [[Spellcaster]] archetypes, with their younger forms depicted in "Magistus"; the last one, "Zoroa" is introduced by "Magistus".

  Each Magistus magician is associated with an "aspect" (used to name the monsters' and the guardian deity monsters' Japanese ''kanji'' names), a summoning method (used by the magicians' related Extra Deck monsters), a guardian deity monster card, and other related in-theme cards.

  Many of the theme's cards released following the release of the ''OCG Stories'' storyline depict additional events and characters introduced by ''OCG Stories''. These include "[[Magistus Chorozo]]" and "[[Spoon, the Seal of Magistus]]", counterparts of the characters [[Chorozo]] and [[Spoon]].

  == Playing style ==
  "Magistus" is an archetype focused on summoning Level 4 Spellcasters, using them to perform Special Summons from the Extra Deck, and equipping monsters for beneficial effects. Many "Magistus" cards also synergize—to varying extents—with the playstyle of their related "original" archetype, i.e. "[[Invoked]]", "[[Endymion]]", and "[[Witchcrafter]]"

  All "Magistus" Main Deck monsters are Level 4 Spellcasters with basic consistency or build-building effects, and many feature a shared effect that equips a "Magistus" monster with an Extra Deck one (from various locations).

  |}

  "Magistus" Extra Deck monsters cover all Extra Deck [[monster card type]]s, and most can be made with 2 Level 4 Spellcaster monsters (being Link 2, Synchro Level 8, Rank 4, or require 2 Fusion materials). They contain a mix of board builders ([[Rilliona, the Wondrous Magistus Witch Wardrobe|Xyz "Rilliona"]]), field control ([[Zoroa, the Magistus Conflagrant Calamity|Synchro "Zoroa"]], [[Zoroa, the Magistus Verethragna|Fusion "Zoroa"]], "[[Invoked Magistus Omega]]", "[[Aiwass, the Magistus Spell Spirit|Aiwass]]"), and recovery ("[[Ninaruru, the Magistus Glass Goddess|Ninaruru]]", [[Endymion, the Crescent of Magistus|Link "Endymion"]]). 

  Notably, a large percentage of "Magistus" Extra Deck monsters have effects when treated as [[Equip Card]]s.

  ! Magistus

  | (Ignition) Negates an opponent's monster's effects
  |-
  | [[Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden|Artemis]]
  | (Ignition) Searches a "Magistus" monster
  |}

  The Extra Deck "Magistus" without equip effects still interact with monster Equip Cards in their own ways:

  * Fusion "Zoroa", Synchro "Zoroa", and Link "Endymion" have on-field effects that require or benefit from the presence of Monster Cards in the Spell/Trap Zone
  * "[[Invoked Magistus Omega]]" has an effect that equips itself to another monster, and applies effects only if it is equipped through its own effect
  * "Chorozo" can be [[Contact Fusion|Contact Fused]] with Monster Cards in the Spell/Trap zone, and serves as an extender

  Several Extra Deck "Magistus" also have their own equip-from-ED/GY effects.

  "Magistus" Spell/Traps provide varied utility and combo tools. "[[Verre Magic - Lacrima of Light]]" searches, "[[Magia Magic - Thunder of Judgment]]" provides disruption, "[[Magistus Invocation]]" is a Fusion spell, "[[Magistus Vritra]]" revives from GY, "[[Trismagistus]]" summons from hand, and "[[Magistus Theurgy]]" provides extra ED equips.

  "Magistus" generally aims to use its searchers and advantage generators to summon on-field bodies that turn into in-theme bosses, and use them to control the field; the Equip Card "advantage", while abundant, often requires additional work to be turned into usable materials. The Deck's core searchers are "Spoon", "Verre Magic", Xyz "Rilliona", Main Deck "Rilliona", and "Artemis", while the main advantage generators are Main Deck "Zoroa" and "Artemis". The main bosses are usually Synchro "Zoroa" and Fusion "Zoroa".

  Externally, the deck synergizes with other Level 4 Spellcaster-focused themes and themes that make use of Spell/Trap Zone monster cards. [[Crowley, the Gifted Magistus|Crowley Retrain]], "[[Magia Magic - Thunder of Judgment]]" and "[[Verre Magic - Lacrima of Light]]" explicitly interacts with their "original" archetypes' playstyles. For individual cards, "[[Snake-Eyes Doomed Dragon]]" is readily accessible in "Magistus", and "[[Witchcrafter Genni]]" can be used to copy "Verre Magic", forcing the activation of its summon-from-deck effect. The deck's external synergies is somewhat limited by the xenolocking applied by Xyz "Rilliona", a key searcher in the Deck.
