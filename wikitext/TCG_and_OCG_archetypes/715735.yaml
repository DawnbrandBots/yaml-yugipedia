  {{Quote|The archetype's tagline in promotional material|This is the story of the "beginning".}}
  "'''Magistus'''" (マギストス ''Magisutosu'') is an [[archetype]] of monsters with various [[Type]]s (primarily [[Spellcaster]]) and [[Attribute]]s which debuted in ''[[Deck Build Pack: Genesis Impactors]]''. It is the second theme featured in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Stories]]'' manga.

  == Etymology ==
  ''Magistus'' is based on [[wikipedia:Hermes Trismegistus|Hermes Trismegistus]], the purported author of the [[wikipedia:Hermetica|Hermetic Corpus]], a series of sacred texts that are the basis of [[wikipedia:Hermeticism|Hermeticism]].

  In Japanese, all "Magistus" cards have kanji names with a non-standard reading, with "Magistus" always forming part of this non-standard reading. "Magistus" does not correspond to any particular kanji base.

  In Japanese, each of the monsters is associated with one of the the four Great Sages, including the title of their corresponding Great Sage in their own kanji name (Lawbook, Absolute Flame, Crystal, or Sacred Magic); this naming convention was not included in their ''TCG'' names.

  == Design ==
  The "Magistus" archetype features counterparts of key members of older [[Spellcaster]] archetypes, with the exception of the never-seen-before "[[Zoroa, the Magistus of Flame]]". Based on card artworks and pre-existing card lore, it appears they used to be powerful magicians forming the "Magistus" guild, before they separated from each other and founded their own independent groups.

  "Magistus" monsters form into 4 groups, each associated to a specific "aspect". Within each of the four groups, they fulfill up to 3 roles:
  * A Spellcaster Main Deck "Magistus", depicting the great sage.
  * A usually non-Spellcaster Extra Deck "Magistus", depicting the great sage's guardian deity.
  * A Spellcaster Extra Deck "Magistus" (sharing the same monster card type as their guardian deity), depicting the great sage's empowered form.

  == Playing style ==
  "Magistus" is an archetype focused on summoning Level 4 Spellcasters, using them to perform Special Summons from the Extra Deck, and equipping monsters for beneficial effects.

  All "Magistus" Main Deck monsters are Level 4 Spellcasters, each with an individual effect(s) and a shared effect that equips a "Magistus" monster with an Extra Deck one. The individual effects also somewhat synergize with the themes their counterparts belong to.

  | Special Summons a Level 4 Spellcaster from the hand or GY

  | [[Endymion, the Magistus of Mastery|Endymion]]

  |-
  | [[Crowley, the Magistus of Grimoires|Crowley]]

  |-
  | [[Rilliona, the Magistus of Verre|Rilliona]]
  | Searches a "Magistus" Spell/Traps, returns a banished Level 4 or lowe Spellcaster to GY
  |}

  "Magistus" Extra Deck monsters cover all Extra Deck [[monster card type]]s. With the exception of Chorozo and Synchro Zoroa, they have effects when treated as [[Equip Card]]s.

  |-
  | [[Artemis, the Magistus Moon Maiden|Artemis]]
  | [[Link Monster|Link]]

  |}

  "Magistus" Spell/Traps provide varied utility and combo tools, including Special Summons from hand ("[[Trismagistus]]"), more ED equipping ("[[Magistus Theurgy]]"), Fusion Summoning ("[[Magistus Invocation]]"), and GY revival ("[[Magistus Vritra]]")

  Generally, the deck aims to go first, and use its core searchers (Xyz "Rilliona" in particular, but also Main Deck "Rilliona" and "Artemis") and combo enablers ("Magistus" S/T, Main Deck "Zoroa") to turbo out Synchro "Zoroa", who acts as a floodgating boss monster; good hands can sometimes also allow an "Aiwass" to be summoned for an extra disruption.

  The deck has good consistency and recursion, but average boss monsters, and thus often has to be supported by other decks such as "[[Invoked]]" or "[[Dogmatika]]", who also feature Level 4 Spellcaster monsters. Rather unsurprisingly, "Crowley" has synergies with the "Invoked" archetype, with his effect being able to support the Fusion Summon of "Invoked" monsters. "Crowley" can also be used to change its Attribute to WATER and overlay with "Endymion" into "[[Bahamut Shark]]" to make a "[[Toadally Awesome]]". Other generic [[Rank 4]] options may be a good idea to look into for potential synergies.
