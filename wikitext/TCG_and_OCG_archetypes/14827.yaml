  "'''LV'''" ({{Ruby|ＬＶ|レベル}} ''Reberu'') is an [[archetype]] of monsters that, once certain conditions are met, can [[send]] themselves to the [[Graveyard]] to [[Special Summon]] a more powerful version of themselves from the [[hand]] or [[Deck]]. The archetype encompasses multiple monster [[archetype]]s and [[series]] that utilize "LV" effects, and have the "LV" archetypal name.
  In the anime and manga, "LV" cards were used by [[Yugi Muto]], [[Jaden Yuki]], [[Chazz Princeton]], [[Daigo Sorano]], [[Gill Randsborg]], and [[Queen]].
  __TOC__

  == Members ==
  === OCG/TCG (Level Up Effect) ===
  Each "LV" monster archetype/series includes at least one low-[[Level]] "base" monster that can be Normal/Summoned Set, and one or more high-Level forms that can be Special Summoned with the "Level Up" effect of the base monster. The "Level Up" effect always involves [[send]]ing the monster on the field to the [[Graveyard]] to [[Special Summon]] its higher-Leveled counterpart (specified by name in its effect text) from the [[hand]] or [[Deck]].
  To ensure that the Level Up effects are actually being used, higher-Level LV monsters are typically either:
  * [[Nomi]] monsters that cannot be Normal Summoned/Set, and must be Special Summoned by the effects of their lower-Level counterparts, or
  * Only gain effects if they were Special Summoned by the effects of their lower-Level counterparts.

  === OCG/TCG (Non-Level Up Effect) ===
  There are several "LV" monsters who do not use or are not specified in any "Level Up" effect. Because they are not specified in any card text, they cannot be [[Special Summoned]] with "[[Level Up!]]".
  * [[Armed Dragon]]
  ** [[Armed Dragon LV10]]
  ** [[Armed Dragon LV10 White]]
  ** [[Armed Dragon Thunder LV3]]
  ** [[Armed Dragon Thunder LV5]]
  ** [[Armed Dragon Thunder LV7]]
  ** [[Armed Dragon Thunder LV10]]
  * [[Winged Kuriboh (archetype)|Winged Kuriboh]]
  ** [[Winged Kuriboh LV6]]
  ** [[Winged Kuriboh LV9]]
  ** [[Winged Kuriboh LV10]]

  === Non-OCG/TCG ===
  * [[Masked Knight]]
  ** [[Masked Knight LV3]]
  ** [[Masked Knight LV5]]
  ** [[Masked Knight LV7]]
  * [[Silent Magician LV0]]
  * [[Silent Swordsman LV0]]

  == Trivia ==
  * The 1 [[Tribute]] versions of "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon]]", "[[Silent Swordsman]]", "[[Mystic Swordsman]]", "[[Masked Knight]]" and "[[Ultimate Insect]]" all have 2300 [[ATK]].
  * The "[[Dark Mimic]]" [[series]] is the only one without a [[Tribute Monster]] in its set. Additionally, "Mystic Swordsman" is the only series to have a final form that is a one-Tribute monster.
  * "[[Silent Swordsman]]" used to be the rarest of the "LV" monsters; all three of its forms were only [[Ultra Rare]] and came from different sets. Its final form was only available as a Limited Edition Promo card. As of ''[[Legendary Collection 3: Yugi's World Mega Pack]]'', this is no longer the case, as all three forms of "[[Silent Swordsman]]" are now available as [[Common]]. They and the "Silent Magician" monsters were also reprinted as a part of Yugi Muto's "Gadget" Deck in ''[[Yugi's Legendary Decks]]'', making them all extremely easy to acquire. They were reprinted again along with new support in ''[[Duelist Pack: Rivals of the Pharaoh]]''.
