  "'''Magician'''" ({{Ruby|魔|ま}}{{Ruby|術|じゅつ}}{{Ruby|師|し}} ''Majutsushi'') is an [[archetype]] that consists of both [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yuya Sakaki]] and [[Continuous Spell Card]]s used by [[Yusho Sakaki]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. They first debuted in ''[[Starter Deck 2014]]'' with "[[Stargazer Magician]]" and "[[Timegazer Magician]]". The archetype is related to the "[[Odd-Eyes]]" and "[[Performapal]]" archetypes, both of which are also used by Yuya.
  Due to their Japanese names, a number of older cards, such as "[[Time Wizard]]" and "[[Night Wing Sorceress]]", also fall into this archetype. Also, several older cards, such as the [[Dark Magician (archetype)|"Dark Magician" archetype]] and "[[Magician of Faith]]", include "Magician" in their English names but are not part of this archetype. However, because ''TCG'' and ''OCG'' support for this archetype only works on [[Pendulum Monster]]s and Continuous Spell Cards, neither have been an issue.

  == Members ==
  === Pairs ===
  Some "Magician" [[Pendulum Monster]]s are paired, with each member of a pair having the same naming scheme of the other but representing an opposing concept, and most of the time a [[Pendulum Scale]] that allows a wide range of [[Level]]s for monsters to be [[Pendulum Summon]]ed if placed with it. Additionally, each pair supports a particular [[Special Summon]]ing method.

  === Z-ARC Magicians ===
  These "Magician" [[Pendulum Monster]]s are based on the [[Four Dimensional Dragons]] and "[[Supreme King Z-ARC]]". They are commonly called Z-ARC Magicians since they can be used more easily than their Dimension Dragon counterparts to [[Special Summon]] "Z-ARC" with "[[Astrograph Sorcerer]]" or "[[Chronograph Sorcerer]]". With the exception of "[[Supreme King Gate Magician]]", they are all [[Level]] 4 monsters who each possess both an [[Attribute]] and a [[Pendulum Effect]] that mimics their respective Dragon's effect at the cost of [[destroy]]ing themselves, and are always treated as one of those Dragon's [[archetype]] (except for "[[Performapal Celestial Magician]]"). They can also Summon their corresponding Dragon by using themselves and another monster as [[material]]s.

  The [[Pendulum Effect]]s for the Scale 1 members are [[Trigger Effect|Trigger]]-based (except "Supreme King Gate Magician"), the Scale 8 members are [[Ignition Effect|Ignition]]-based.

  == Playing style ==
  === "Magician" Pendulum Monsters ===
  As a Pendulum archetype, the "Magician" Pendulum Monsters aim to search their various members to set up [[Pendulum Summon]]s. The most notable of these is "[[Pendulum Call]]" which also protects "Magician" cards in the Pendulum Zones from being destroyed. Alternatively, "[[Wisdom-Eye Magician]]" can be used instead "[[Oafdragon Magician]]" is used as a Pendulum Scale to recovers "Wisdom-Eye" and be [[Special Summon]]ed to recover a target for the "Discard 1 Pendulum Monster" effects mentioned above. Because of the effect and activation requirement of "Pendulum Call", it conflicts with the Pendulum Effect of "Wisdom-Eye" so one must decide which one of both cards' effects to use given the current situation.

  "[[Dragonpit Magician]]" and "[[Dragonpulse Magician]]" both have [[Pendulum Scale]] effects to "Discard 1 Pendulum Monster" to destroy an opposing card on the field. "[[Xiangke Magician]]" has the highest ATK of all "Magician" cards and can negate the effect of a LIGHT monster; this monster (alongside "Dragonpit Magician") is most often seen when this archetype is used to support "[[Dark Magician (archetype)|Dark Magician]]", "[[Odd-Eyes]]" and "[[Red-Eyes]]" archetypes that all have powerful Rank 7 monsters.

  "[[Xiangsheng Magician]]" and "[[Timebreaker Magician]]" have the monster removal effects for this archetype, 1-for-1 style each turn.

  The archetype has three Tuner monsters. "[[Tuning Magician]]" and "[[Nobledragon Magician]]" can both Special Summon themselves from the hand or Graveyard, potentially allowing them to be used for two [[Synchro Summon]]s each in the same turn, althought the latter is restricted to be used for Synchro Summoning Dragon monsters only and it caters as support for the "[[Odd-Eyes]]" archetype. The third and perhaps the most important member of the archetype, "[[Harmonizing Magician]]",  Special Summons any other "Pendulum Magician" from the Deck if it is Pendulum Summoned from the hand, allowing additional plays though the Summoned monster gets banished if it leaves the field (except Xyz Summons). It cannot be Special Summoned from the Extra Deck and thus requires a retrieval effect such as "Oafdragon".

  The archetype's Extra Deck support includes:
  * "[[Timestar Magician]]": Can search or recycle DARK Spellcaster monsters and protect Pendulum Monster cards on the field.
  * "[[Enlightenment Paladin]]": Can recycle a Spell if it is Synchro Summoned using a "Magician" Pendulum Monster, and
  * "[[Magician of Hope]]": A direct member of the archetype which can Special Summon additional monsters from the hand and can negate attacks while on the Pendulum Zone.

  ==== With Supreme King and "Pendulumgraph" ====
  The "'''Z-ARC Magicians'''" consisting of "[[Purple Poison Magician]]", "[[Black Fang Magician]]", "[[Double Iris Magician]]", "[[White Wing Magician]]", "[[Supreme King Gate Magician]]" and "[[Performapal Celestial Magician]] can also be used in the Deck as their Scales of 1 and 8 are within the normal range of the Magician archetype while being Level 4 at the same time. However they play rather a bit differently than the rest due to having a bigger focus on self-destruction, as well as the "[[Pendulumgraph]]" cards, both "[[Astrograph Sorcerer]]" and "[[Chronograph Sorcerer]]", "[[Supreme King Z-ARC]]"/"[[Odd-Eyes Arcray Dragon]]" and its related [[Supreme King]] series. The first four "Magician" cards are also treated as an archetype that the [[Four Dimensional Dragons]] are members of, allowing them to be used by "Astrograph Sorcerer" or "Chronograph Sorcerer" to Special Summon "Supreme King Z-ARC". Besides this shared effect, "Astrograph Sorcerer" and "Chronograph Sorcerer" both have effects that Special Summon themselves from the hand while also gaining further advantage which trigger upon a card on their user's field being destroyed. They both also share a similar Pendulum Effect of destroying themselves to either Special Summon or place a "[[Stargazer Magician]]" or "[[Timegazer Magician]]" onto the Pendulum Zone.

  "Purple Poison" can grant DARK Spellcaster monsters gain additional ATK if they battle an opponent's monster and if destroyed, it can destroy one face-up card on the field. "Black Fang" can halve an opponent's monster's ATK and upon destruction, it can revive a DARK Spellcaster monster from the GY. "Double Iris" can make a DARK Spellcaster monster deal double battle damage if they attack a monster and can search a "Pendulumgraph" card upon its destruction. "White Wing" can protect other DARK Spellcaster at the drawback of destroying itself but having no effect upon its destruction though it serves as a Tuner. Finally, "Supreme King Gate Magician" can either place a "[[Supreme King Gate]]" card in the Pendulum Zone, or Special Summon itself to allow its user to search a card that supports "Supreme King Z-ARC".

  The Pendulum Effects of the "Z-ARC Magicians" related to the Four Dimension Dragons grant an effect before destroying the "Magician" monsters themselves, allowing their monster effects to trigger although their destruction can or will be prevented if "Timestar Magician" is present or if "Pendulum Call" is activated beforehand respectively. Their monster effect upon destruction also force your opponent to think twice before negating their Summon and destroy them, and thus, protect other Pendulum Summoned monsters. Also, any of your opponent's attempt of negating their effect (or their activation) and destroying the "Z-ARC Magcians" will only backfire as it can be activated again.

  "Performapal Celestial Magician" allows various useful effects to apply depending on the monster card types the user controls on the turn it is Normal or Special Summoned which can include a search of any Pendulum Monster at the end of the turn, provide itself an ATK boost, attack directly or prevent the opponent from activating monster effects. While on a Pendulum Zone, it can revive a Fusion, Synchro or Xyz Monster that gets destroyed.

  The "Pendulumgraph" archetype (namely "[[Star Pendulumgraph]]" and "[[Time Pendulumgraph]]") serve as additional support for the "Magician" archetype. "Star Pendulumgraph" searches any "Magician" Pendulum Monster if another monster of the said archetype leaves the field thus synergizing well with the self-destructing effects of the "Z-ARC Magicians" and "Wisdom-Eye". "Time Pendulumgraph" is a powerful disruption/removal tool which can destroy one "Magician" card on the user's field and one card on the opponent's field and if two cards are not destroyed, another card on the field can be sent to the Graveyard, without targeting or destroying them. This becomes a one-for-two removal (when destroying "Purple Poison Magician"), or a free two-card removal (by having "Pendulum Call" activated beforehand or controlling "Timestar Magicain"). In addition, both of these "Pendulumgraph" cards also grant targeting protection to Spellcaster monsters from Spell or Trap card effects.

  ==== With "Odd-Eyes" and "Performapal" ====
  The "Magician" archetype shares synergy with the "[[Odd-Eyes]]" and "[[Performapal]]" archetypes. "Odd-Eyes" monsters are an asset for this archetype as "[[Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]]" can search for the vast majority of "Magicians" by destroying itself in the Pendulum Zone and "[[Sky Iris]]" can destroy cards and search for additional "Odd-Eyes" cards for extra consistency. The "Odd-Eyes" Fusion, Synchro and Xyz Monsters (especially "[[Odd-Eyes Vortex Dragon]]") are usually the final monsters that "Magician" decks can end on.

  "[[Nobledragon Magician]]" is usually used as support for "[[Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]]" but can also be used with any Level 4 Monster to Synchro Summon "[[Odd-Eyes Meteorburst Dragon]]", which in turn; can Special Summon a Pendulum Scale to extend a combo or usually make a Rank 7 play off of "Dragonpit Magician".

  "[[Performapal Skullcrobat Joker]]" can search any "Odd-Eyes", "Pendulum Magician" or "[[Performapal]]" when Normal Summoned and can be repeated by using "[[Majespecter Unicorn - Kirin]]" to return "Skullcrobat" to the hand. "[[Performapal Pendulum Sorcerer]]" is recommended to add additional Pendulum Scales as well as triggering the destruction.

  ==== Other additions ====
  As with other Pendulum-based archetypes, the "[[Dracoslayer]]" archetype can be used with this Deck, with "[[Luster Pendulum, the Dracoslayer]]" or "[[Master Pendulum, the Dracoslayer]]" destroying the "Magician" monsters to trigger their effects abd serve as the main components to Summon their Extra Deck members: "[[Ignister Prominence, the Blasting Dracoslayer|Ignister Prominence]]", "[[Majester Paladin, the Ascending Dracoslayer|Majester Paladin]]", and "[[Dinoster Power, the Mighty Dracoslayer|Dinoster Power]]". All three of those monsters provide support to Pendulum Monsters by destroying Pendulum cards to return other cards to the Deck, searching out Pendulum Monsters from the Deck, and protecting Pendulum cards from being destroyed by the opponent, respectively.

  The "Magician" Pendulum Monster archetype greatly benefits from "[[Duelist Alliance (card)|Duelist Alliance]]" as it can search any key cards of the "[[Pendulum (archetype)|Pendulum]]" archetype that supports "Magician" Pendulum Monsters. Due to the effects of various members of the archetype, the "Magician" Pendulum Monster archetype also caters well with DARK Spellcaster monsters in general.

  As per the [[Master Rule#New Master Rules|New Master Rules]], "Magician" is nerfed with the usual power of [[Pendulum Summon]] greatly limited without [[Link Monster]]s and only up to 3 Spell/Traps to use (as the other two Spell/Trap Zones are also Pendulum Zones). Combined with the two "Pendulumgraphs", the player may only use up to 1 Spell/Trap Card at a time. The deck must now be reliant on swarming more bodies to the field for a [[Link Summon]] (useful choices including "[[Beyond the Pendulum]] or "[[Heavymetalfoes Electrumite]]") before Pendulum Summoning them all back, and may consider recurring "Magician" Pendulum Monsters from the face-up Extra Deck to the hand such as those of "Oafdragon Magician's" Pendulum Effect and "[[Amazing Pendulum]]".

  === "Magician" Continuous Spells ===
  The "Magician" archetype of Continuous Spells do not directly synergize with the "Magician" Pendulum Monster archetype but have disruptive effects that work with Spellcaster monsters in general. The two "Magician Hand" cards both negate the first card/effect of a specific card type activated by the opponent during each turn while the user controls a Spellcaster monster; "[[Magician's Right Hand]] negates Spells while "[[Magician's Left Hand]]" negates Traps. "[[Magician's Restage]]" can revive a Spellcaster monster from the Graveyard once though it can search out another "Magician" Continuous Spell if "Restage" is sent to the Graveyard. They are also supported directly by "[[Performapal Sky Magician]]", which on a Quick Effect can return a Continuous Spell from the field to the hand and can activate a "Magician" Continuous Spell from their hand. This can be used to reset the once per turn/once while on the field usage of the cards, allowing the "Magician Hands" to negate another card effect once more or revive another Spellcaster monster with "Restage".

  == Trivia ==
  * All "Magician" [[Tuner monster]]s are female.
