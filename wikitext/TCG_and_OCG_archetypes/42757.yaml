  "'''Chaos'''" (カオス ''Kaosu'') is a very large [[archetype]] of monsters, comprised of several different sub-archetypes. No card directly supports all "Chaos" monsters, with cards that reference the "Chaos" namestring referring to a particular group of monsters. These include:
  *The "Chaos" [[Ritual Monster]]s, which are primarily based on monsters used by [[Yugi Muto]] and [[Seto Kaiba]]. Due to its Japanese name, "[[Black Luster Soldier]]" is a subarchetype of "Chaos" - in the ''TCG'', support for "Chaos" Ritual Monsters always also supports "Black Luster Soldier" Ritual Monsters.
  *The "Chaos" [[Synchro Monster]]s.
  *The "[[CXyz]]" and "[[Number C]]" archetypes, which are sub-archetypes of "Chaos" due to their Japanese names. They are collectively referred as the "[[C_(archetype)|C]]" cards.

  Also of note is the [[Chaos (series)|Chaos series]], which focuses on the [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] attributes without using "Chaos"-specific support. Many historically significant cards, such as "[[Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End]]" and "[[Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning]]", belong to this series.

  A handful of earlier monsters such as "[[Kamionwizard]]" and "[[Morphing Jar 2|Morphing Jar #2]]" are part of this archetype due to their Japanese names. Conversely, several monsters with "Chaos" in their ''TCG'' names, such as "[[Dark Magician of Chaos]]" and "[[Envoy of Chaos]]", are not part of this archetype since their Japanese names don't contain 「カオス」. As they do not belong to one of the supported subsets of "Chaos" monsters, and since there is no generic support for all potential members, there are no monsters that need an [[archetype condition]] because of this archetype.

  == Members ==
  === Ritual Chaos ===
  All of the "Chaos" Ritual Monsters are [[Card evolutions|upgraded]] [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]] "Chaos" forms of iconic [[Signature card|signature monsters]] used by [[Yugi Muto]] ("[[Dark Magician]]" and "[[Gaia The Fierce Knight]]") and [[Seto Kaiba]] ("[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]").
  All "Chaos" Ritual Monsters released after the introduction of "[[Chaos Form]]" specify it as the [[Ritual Spell]] for their [[Ritual Summon]]. "Chaos Form" also supports the "Chaos" Ritual Monsters that predate its release, including the "[[Black Luster Soldier (archetype)|Black Luster Soldier]]" (''OCG'': "Chaos Soldier") Ritual Monsters.

  Additionally, "[[Master of Chaos]]" is an [[Ultimate Magical]] [[Fusion Monster]] that requires 1 "Chaos" or "[[Black Luster Soldier (archetype)|Black Luster Soldier]]" [[Ritual Monster]] as one of its [[Fusion Material]], making it a [[support]] card for the Ritual "Chaos" archetype.

  === Synchro Chaos ===
  "Chaos" Synchro monsters are all LIGHT or DARK monsters, and (with the exception of "[[Chaos King Archfiend]]") have effects that support LIGHT/DARK monsters and banishing; this loosely ties them to the playstyle of the LIGHT and DARK [[Chaos (series)|Chaos series]].
  A sub-series of "Chaos" Synchro Monsters can be distinguished by having a consistent naming pattern: In the Japanese OCG, they each have a two-part name, with the first part being a non-Japanese name consisting of "Chaos" (Japanese: 「カオス」) followed by a title after an interpunct, and the second part being a kanji name enclosed in dashes, consisting of "of Chaos" (Japanese: 「混沌の」) followed by a title.
  Members of the themed "Chaos" Synchro Monster sub-series all feature a black/white/gold color palette.

  === The "C" archetype ===
  There are two subarchetypes of "Chaos" Xyz Monsters, namely the "Number C" and the "CXyz" archetypes. Many, but not all of these cards also have the word "Chaos" in their name strings in the ''TCG''  and repeat the string「カオス」 in Japanese. "C" cards are usually counterparts of their base forms, but are one rank higher, require one more Monster to Xyz Summon by overlaying monsters of respective levels, and can be alternatively Xyz Summoned through a [[Rank-Up]] card.

  There is one "Chaos" Xyz monster belonging to neither subarchetype: this is [[Number iC1000: Numerounius Numerounia]]. It is also the respective ace monster for both the "[[Number C]]" and "[[Numeron]]" archetypes yet not actually belonging to this archetype due to a slight alteration with the name.

  ==== Support ====
  Archetype-specific support Monster cards that specifically have "Number C" (Japanese: 「{{Ruby|Ｃ|カオス}}{{Ruby|Ｎｏ．|ナンバーズ}}」) or "CXyz" (Japanese: 「{{Ruby|ＣＸ|カオスエクシーズ}}」) in their name strings.
  These cards are also supported by [[Rank-Up]] cards. Many of these cards which support one or both of the "C" archetypes also belong to the "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" archetype.

  No card supports a Chaos Xyz Monster through the term "Chaos" Xyz Monster.

  === Other "Chaos" cards ===
  The first card to belong to the archetype, [[Kamionwizard]] (Japanese: 「カオス・ウィザード」), along with many other well-known Chaos monsters such as [[Chaos Emperor Dragon]], are not supported by the "Chaos" archetype. As a result, no [[archetype condition]] is required if their localized names contain "Chaos".
