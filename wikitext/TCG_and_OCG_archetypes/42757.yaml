  }}

  "'''Chaos'''" (カオス ''Kaosu'') is a very large [[archetype]] of monsters that encompasses multiple subarchetypes characterized by their Summoning method and/or their particular subarchetype strings. However, support only affects disjoint subsets of monsters: namely, the Ritual "Chaos" Monsters, the Synchro "Chaos" Monsters, and the two "[[C_(archetype)|C]]" subarchetypes. Several cards in this archetype, especially "[[Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End]]" and "[[Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning]]", are of historic significance in official [[tournament]]s, actually belong to the [[Chaos (series)|Chaos]] series of monsters that focuses on both [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] attributes together without using "Chaos"-specific support.

  The "Chaos" Ritual Monsters are primarily based on monsters used by [[Yugi Muto]] and [[Seto Kaiba]]. Due to its Japanese name, all "Black Luster Soldier" monsters are also "Chaos" monsters, so in the ''TCG'', support for "Chaos" Ritual Monsters always also supports "Black Luster Soldier" Ritual Monsters. "[[Black Luster Soldier (archetype)|Black Luster Soldier]]" is also an archetype on its own, with cards specifically supporting "Black Luster Soldier" regardless of their card type and not the other "Chaos" Ritual Monsters.

  The "Chaos" Synchro Monsters are associated with the [[Chaos (series)|Chaos]] series of cards, which are [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] monsters associated with banishing.

  Due to their Japanese names, "[[CXyz]]" and "[[Number C]]" are also sub-archetypes of "Chaos". They are collectively referred as the "[[C_(archetype)|C]]" cards.

  A handful of earlier monsters such as "[[Kamionwizard]]" and "[[Morphing Jar 2|Morphing Jar #2]]" are also part of this archetype due to their Japanese names. Conversely, several monsters with "Chaos" in their ''TCG'' names, such as "[[Dark Magician of Chaos]]" and "[[Envoy of Chaos]]", are not part of this archetype since their Japanese names don't contain 「カオス」. As they do not belong to one of the supported subsets of "Chaos" monsters, and there is no generic support for all potential members, there are no monsters that need an [[archetype condition]] because of this archetype.

  ==Members==
  ===Ritual Chaos===
  All of the "Chaos" Ritual Monsters are [[Card evolutions|upgraded]] [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]] "Chaos" forms of iconic [[Signature card|signature monsters]] used by [[Yugi Muto]] ("[[Dark Magician]]" and "[[Gaia The Fierce Knight]]") and [[Seto Kaiba]] ("[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]").
  All "Chaos" Ritual Monsters released after the introduction of "[[Chaos Form]]" specify it as the [[Ritual Spell]] for their [[Ritual Summon]]. "Chaos Form" also supports the "Chaos" Ritual Monsters that predate its release, including the "[[Black Luster Soldier (archetype)|Black Luster Soldier]]" (''OCG'': "Chaos Soldier") Ritual Monsters.

  Additionally, "[[Master of Chaos]]" is an [[Ultimate Magical]] [[Fusion Monster]] that requires 1 "Chaos" or "[[Black Luster Soldier (archetype)|Black Luster Soldier]]" [[Ritual Monster]] as one of its [[Fusion Material]], making it a [[support]] card for the Ritual "Chaos" archetype.

  ===Synchro Chaos===
  "Chaos" Synchro monsters are all LIGHT or DARK monsters, and (with the exception of "[[Chaos King Archfiend]]") have effects that support LIGHT/DARK monsters and banishing; this loosely ties them to the playstyle of the LIGHT and DARK [[Chaos (series)|Chaos series]].
  A sub-series of "Chaos" Synchro Monsters can be distinguished by having a consistent naming pattern: In the Japanese OCG, they each have a two-part name, with the first part being a non-Japanese name consisting of "Chaos" (Japanese: 「カオス」) followed by a title after an interpunct, and the second part being a kanji name enclosed in dashes, consisting of "of Chaos" (Japanese: 「混沌の」) followed by a title.
  Members of the themed "Chaos" Synchro Monster sub-series all feature a black/white/gold color palette.

  ===The "C" archetype===
  There are also two subarchetypes of "Chaos" Xyz Monsters, namely the "Number C" and the "CXyz" archetypes. Many, but not all of these cards also have the word "Chaos" in their name strings in the ''TCG''  and repeat the string「カオス」 in Japanese. "C" cards are usually counterparts of their base forms, but are one rank higher, require one more Monster to Xyz Summon by overlaying monsters of respective levels, and can be alternatively Xyz Summoned through a [[Rank-Up]] card.

  There is one "Chaos" Xyz monster belonging to neither subarchetype: this is [[Number iC1000: Numerounius Numerounia]]. It is also the respective ace monster for both the "[[Number C]]" and "[[Numeron]]" archetypes yet not actually belonging to this archetype due to a slight alteration with the name.

  ====Support====
  Archetype-specific support Monster cards that specifically have "Number C" (Japanese: 「{{Ruby|Ｃ|カオス}}{{Ruby|Ｎｏ．|ナンバーズ}}」) or "CXyz" (Japanese: 「{{Ruby|ＣＸ|カオスエクシーズ}}」) in their name strings.
  These cards are also supported by [[Rank-Up]] cards. Many of these cards which support one or both of the "C" archetypes also belong to the "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" archetype.

  No card supports a Chaos Xyz Monster through the term "Chaos" Xyz Monster.

  ===Other "Chaos" cards===
  The first card to belong to the archetype, [[Kamionwizard]] (Japanese: 「カオス・ウィザード」), along with many other well-known Chaos monsters such as [[Chaos Emperor Dragon]], are not supported by the "Chaos" archetype. As a result, no [[archetype condition]] is required if their localized names contain "Chaos".
