  "'''D/D'''" ({{Ruby|Ｄ|ディー}}{{Ruby|Ｄ|ディー}} ''Dīdī''), known as "'''DD'''" in the English [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|manga]] and pronounced "'''Double D'''" in the dubbed anime, is an [[archetype]] of primarily [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Declan Akaba]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime and manga. It is supported by its own sub-archetype, "[[D/D/D]]", as well as the "[[Dark Contract]]" archetype.

  The "D/D" playstyle is a complex, multi-faceted playstyle focused on utilizing almost all summoning methods available in the game, combining long combos of [[Pendulum Summon|Pendulum]], [[Fusion Summon|Fusion]], [[Synchro Summon|Synchro]], [[Xyz Summon|Xyz]], and [[Link Summon]]ing to summon powerful boss monsters and build impressively strong boards. Secondarily, the "D/D" playstyle involves managing the mandatory self-damage effects of their "[[Dark Contract]]" [[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous Spell]] and [[Continuous Trap Card|Trap]] support cards. Within the archetype, most "D/D" monsters are main deck monsters with weaker supportive monsters with combo-enabling effects, while most "D/D/D" monsters are boss monsters with field-holding effects.

  In the manga, the archetype has a vastly different playstyle. It lacks the anime version's focus on multiple Summoning methods and managing "Dark Contract" effect damage; instead, it exclusively uses [[Pendulum Summon]]ing, is supported by many manga-only supportive Spell/Traps, and focuses on reducing the [[DEF]] of the opponent's monsters to 0 (reflecting [[Reiji Akaba (manga)|Reiji]]'s obsession with the number zero in the manga) and dealing [[piercing]] damage.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  The regular "D/D" monsters seem to be based on different figures and monsters from Western mythology, while the "D/D Savant" monsters are references to great natural scientists from Western history. In contrast, the "[[D/D/D]]" sub-archetype features a distinct design style from the rest of the archetype, with many of its members modeled after famous conquerors from world history.

  Taken together with its [[Dark Contract|subordinate]] and sub-archetypes, the "D/D" archetype features a mild "business" sub-theme (probably to fit the profession of [[Declan Akaba|their owner]] in the anime), with many support cards referencing elements of modern big business. For example, the "Dark Contract" cards resemble business contracts, and the names of "[[D/D/D Human Resources]]" and "[[Contract Laundering]]" reference the company practices of [[wikipedia:human resources|human resources]] and [[wikipedia:money laundering|money laundering]], respectively.

  Additionally, some of the archetype's boss monsters such as "[[D/D/D Doom King Armageddon]]" feature a pun in its Japanese name, such as "''Great Des (Death) King''" being scripted as "''Shiiō''", a homophone for "[[wikipedia:Chief executive officer|CEO]]". A similar pun can be found in the Japanese name of "[[D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok]]" and "[[D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok]]", "''Oblivion King''", which is scripted as "''Kaichiō''", a homophone for "[[wikipedia:Chairman|Chairman]]".

  In the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|ARC-V manga]], the "D/D" monsters appear to be demons with a mechanical, scientific theme (distinct in design to the "D/D Savant" monsters) and have equipment like scales or microscopes instead of faces.

  === Etymology ===
  According to [[Sora Perse]], "D/D" is short for "Different Dimension" (ディファレント・ディメンション ''Difarento Dimenshon''), the same as the [[D.D.]] series.<!--Please do not add comparisons with "D.D."; You would be comparing an English name ("D.D.") with a Japanese name ("DD"). Also, "D.D." is ''not'' an archetype.--><ref name="ep12">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V|12|ref}}</ref>

  == Members ==
  "D/D" monsters tend to vary based on the medium in which they were introduced. Two of the "D/D" subseries, "D/D Savant" and "D/D Surveyor", have distinct origins from the other "D/D" monsters introduced in the same medium.
  * Most "D/D" monsters introduced in the anime are based on figures from Western mythology. "[[D/D Gryphon]]", the only ''OCG''/''TCG''-original standard "D/D" monster, is also based on Western mythology.
  ** The "D/D Savant" series, which originated in the anime, are based on famous scientists and engineers.
  * The "D/D" monsters introduced in the ''ARC-V'' manga utilize the "D/D" to create double-meanings, or just use it to make an alliteration.
  ** The "D/D Surveyor" series, which originated in the manga, are based on various types of measuring and observational equipment.
  * The two "D/D" monsters introduced in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V - Scale SP1|Special One-Shot]]'' manga ("Proud Chevalier" and "Proud Ogre") function as a distinct duo, not following any of the patterns from other media.

  == Playing style ==
  The archetype's primary play-style is to use the beneficial effects of its various [[Pendulum Monster]]s and "[[Dark Contract]]" [[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous Spells]] and [[Continuous Trap Card|Traps]] to gain card advantage while also trying to avoid the [[LP]] damage with the effects of "[[D/D/D Oracle King d'Arc]]", "[[D/D/D Rebel King Leonidas]]" and/or "[[Go! - D/D/D Divine Zero King Rage]]", or remove the "Dark Contract" cards from the [[field]] (after completing the card's combo) with the effects of other members. Managing these cards properly is essential to victory.

  When [[Normal Summon]]ed, "[[D/D Savant Kepler]]" can [[search]] for any "Dark Contract" card, whereas "[[D/D Savant Copernicus]]" [[send]]s a "Dark Contract" or "D/D" card from the [[Deck]] to the [[GY]]. "[[D/D Swirl Slime]]" also has a useful effect, from the hand, for loading the GY with revival targets for later, and can [[banish]] itself from the GY on the same turn to [[Special Summon]] any "D/D" monster from the hand. Its GY-counterpart, "[[D/D Necro Slime]]", is able to [[Fusion Summon]] by banishing itself and another "D/D" monster from the GY, making the duo incredibly useful. Combined with other monsters such as "[[D/D Lamia]]", they can allow for instant usage of [[Synchro Monster]]s too. This leads into using some of the archetype's most powerful combo-pieces like "[[D/D/D Flame King Genghis]]" and "[[D/D/D Gust King Alexander]]", as well as their [[D/D/D Flame High King Genghis|High]] [[D/D/D Gust High King Alexander|King]] forms (the latter of which also provides a threatening 6000 [[ATK]] [[beatstick]]). Alternatively, this can also grant access to monsters such as "[[Crystal Wing Synchro Dragon]]" and "[[PSY-Framelord Omega]]". However, with the additions of "[[D/D Berfomet]]" and "[[D/D Gryphon]]", not only is [[Synchro Summon]]ing easier, but so is [[Xyz Summon]]ing, thus granting access to not only "[[D/D/D Wave King Caesar]]" - who provides great recovery at the end of the [[Battle Phase]] - but also its [[D/D/D Wave High King Caesar|High King]] version and "[[D/D/D Marksman King Tell]]", who provide Summon negation (with an ATK boost) and ATK/[[DEF]] ''reduction'' (which turns the downsides of any "Dark Contract" to the player's favor) with the ability to dump any "D/D" or "Dark Contract" card, respectively.

  Along with "Zero King Rage", one of the best Pendulum Monsters to place in the [[Pendulum Scale]]s is "[[D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok]]", who can easily revive any "D/D" monster when another member of the archetype is Special Summoned, at the cost of 1000 damage and the halving of battle damage that turn. Other amazing choices for the Pendulum Scale includes "[[D/D/D Chaos King Apocalypse]]" and "[[D/D/D Vice King Requiem]]", extending the user's plays and combos while also helping to avoid potential defeats due to the player's own "Dark Contract" cards. "[[D/D Dog]]" can also help immensely by negating the effects of various monsters Summoned from the [[Extra Deck]]. Another potent choice is "[[D/D Savant Thomas]]", a one-card [[Rank]] 8 Xyz Summon - that being "[[D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga]]", who outright shuts down every other card on the field when Summoned and can also either destroy every [[Spell]]/[[Trap]] on the field or [[Set]] a "Dark Contract" from your GY. However, "Kali Yuga" is not alone, as "[[D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex]]" is another terrific Xyz Monster to utilize that can outright absorb other monsters before it by [[attach]]ing them as [[Xyz Material]]s, not unlike "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]". It is also incredibly easy to Summon as it can use ''any'' "[[D/D/D]]" monster as [[material]], which can include the opponent's monsters with the use of "[[D/D/D Headhunt]]".

  One of the best "D/D/D" monsters to Summon from the Extra Deck is "[[D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh]]", since it requires only 2 "D/D" monsters, and in return immediately sets up the player's Pendulum Scale with monsters straight from the Deck, granting them all the benefits of "Zero King Rage" and "Abyss Ragnarok" straight away. That being said, this ability comes at the cost of 1000 LP and the inability to Special Summon anything other than "D/D" monsters for the rest of the turn. Upon being [[destroy]]ed by the opponent, "Gilgamesh" will also replace himself with a fellow "D/D/D" monster from the Extra Deck or GY, of which there are plenty of good choices.

  === Weaknesses ===
  Because this Deck focuses on [[swarm]]ing to push the game, cards that can disable or counter swarming or [[search]]ing, like "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" or "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]", can greatly hinder this Deck. Additionally, the archetype's synergy with the "[[Dark Contract]]" archetype and use of Pendulum Scales provides a weakness to [[Spell]]/[[Trap]] removal, as well as a dependence on cards that mitigate the damage from the "Dark Contract" cards. Consequently, "D/D" players may struggle with finding space for other spells and traps due to Contracts and Pendulum Scales clogging up their [[Spell & Trap Zone]]. The archetype is also lacking in dealing with monsters outside of battle, with their only forms of effect removal being "[[Dark Contract with the Witch]]", the monster effect of "[[D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex]]" and "[[D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok]]", and the [[Pendulum Effect]] of "[[D/D Count Surveyor]]". Cards that also negatively affect certain [[Attribute]]s, such as "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]", are also potentially deadly.
