  "'''D/D'''" ({{Ruby|Ｄ|ディー}}{{Ruby|Ｄ|ディー}} ''Dīdī''), known as "'''DD'''" in the English [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|manga]] and pronounced "'''Double D'''" in the dubbed anime, is an [[archetype]] of primarily [[DARK]] [[Fiend]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Declan Akaba]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime and manga. It is supported by its own sub-archetype, "[[D/D/D]]", as well as the "[[Dark Contract]]" archetype.

  The "D/D" playstyle is a complex, multi-faceted playstyle focused on utilizing almost all summoning methods available in the game, combining long combos of [[Pendulum Summon|Pendulum]], [[Fusion Summon|Fusion]], [[Synchro Summon|Synchro]], [[Xyz Summon|Xyz]], and [[Link Summon]]ing to summon powerful boss monsters and build impressively strong boards. Secondarily, the "D/D" playstyle involves managing the mandatory self-damage effects of their "[[Dark Contract]]" [[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous Spell]] and [[Continuous Trap Card|Trap]] support cards. Within the archetype, most "D/D" monsters are main deck monsters with weaker supportive monsters with combo-enabling effects, while most "D/D/D" monsters are boss monsters with field-holding effects.

  In the manga, the archetype has a vastly different playstyle. It lacks the anime version's focus on multiple Summoning methods and managing "Dark Contract" effect damage; instead, it exclusively uses [[Pendulum Summon]]ing, is supported by many manga-only supportive Spell/Traps, and focuses on reducing the [[DEF]] of the opponent's monsters to 0 (reflecting [[Reiji Akaba (manga)|Reiji]]'s obsession with the number zero in the manga) and dealing [[piercing]] damage.

  == Design ==
  === Appearance ===
  The regular "D/D" monsters seem to be based on different figures and monsters from Western mythology, while the "D/D Savant" monsters are references to great natural scientists from Western history. In contrast, the "[[D/D/D]]" sub-archetype features a distinct design style from the rest of the archetype, with many of its members modeled after famous conquerors from world history.

  Taken together with its [[Dark Contract|subordinate]] and sub-archetypes, the "D/D" archetype features a mild "business" sub-theme (probably to fit the profession of [[Declan Akaba|their owner]] in the anime), with many support cards referencing elements of modern big business. For example, the "Dark Contract" cards resemble business contracts, and the names of "[[D/D/D Human Resources]]" and "[[Contract Laundering]]" reference the company practices of [[wikipedia:human resources|human resources]] and [[wikipedia:money laundering|money laundering]], respectively.

  Additionally, some of the archetype's boss monsters such as "[[D/D/D Doom King Armageddon]]" feature a pun in its Japanese name, such as "''Great Des (Death) King''" being scripted as "''Shiiō''", a homophone for "[[wikipedia:Chief executive officer|CEO]]". A similar pun can be found in the Japanese name of "[[D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok]]" and "[[D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar Ragnarok]]", "''Oblivion King''", which is scripted as "''Kaichiō''", a homophone for "[[wikipedia:Chairman|Chairman]]".

  In the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|ARC-V manga]], the "D/D" monsters appear to be demons with a mechanical, scientific theme (distinct in design to the "D/D Savant" monsters) and have equipment like scales or microscopes instead of faces.

  === Etymology ===
  According to [[Sora Perse]], "D/D" is short for "Different Dimension" (ディファレント・ディメンション ''Difarento Dimenshon''), the same as the [[D.D.]] series.<!--Please do not add comparisons with "D.D."; You would be comparing an English name ("D.D.") with a Japanese name ("DD"). Also, "D.D." is ''not'' an archetype.--><ref name="ep12">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V|12|ref}}</ref>

  == Members ==
  "D/D" monsters tend to vary based on the medium in which they were introduced. Two of the "D/D" subseries, "D/D Savant" and "D/D Surveyor", have distinct origins from the other "D/D" monsters introduced in the same medium.
  * Most "D/D" monsters introduced in the anime are based on figures from Western mythology. "[[D/D Gryphon]]", the only ''OCG''/''TCG''-original standard "D/D" monster, is also based on Western mythology.
  ** The "D/D Savant" series, which originated in the anime, are based on famous scientists and engineers.
  * The "D/D" monsters introduced in the ''ARC-V'' manga utilize the "D/D" to create double-meanings, or just use it to make an alliteration.
  ** The "D/D Surveyor" series, which originated in the manga, are based on various types of measuring and observational equipment.
  * The two "D/D" monsters introduced in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V - Scale SP1|Special One-Shot]]'' manga ("Proud Chevalier" and "Proud Ogre") function as a distinct duo, not following any of the patterns from other media.

  == Playing style ==
  "D/D", including its directly related "[[D/D/D]]" and "[[Dark Contract]]" archetypes, is a large archetype with many diverse effects. Its members and support generally feature the following effects:

  * Non-"D/D/D" "D/D" monsters: Main Deck Effect or Pendulum Monsters with combo-making effects, supporting the summon of "D/D/D" monsters.
  * "D/D/D" monsters: Main Deck or Extra Deck monsters covering almost all [[monster card type]]s in the game, featuring combo-making or field control effects. Many interact with "Dark Contract" cards and their effects directly or indirectly, and these interactions usually result in the prevention of "Dark Contract" self-damaging effects by either removing them or preventing effect damage.
  * "Dark Contract" Spell/Traps: [[Continuous Spell]]s and [[Continuous Trap|Traps]] with combo-making or field control effects that depend on "D/D" monsters, and usually also feature mandatory self-damage effects. Rather than having [[Continuous-like Effect]]s, most "Dark Contract" cards only feature activatable once-per-turn effects, encouraging the player to dispose of them after use to avoid the self-damage. 
  * "D/D" Spell/Traps: Situational recovery Traps, excluding "[[D/D/D Headhunt]]", which is an interruption.

  "D/D" is most optimally built as a [[combo]] deck, though owing to its large card pool and diverse effects, it can technically also function as a non-combo deck (for non-standard formats, for example).

  The major in-archetype cards include the following:

  * Searchers:
  ** "[[D/D Savant Kepler|Savant Kepler]]", "[[D/D/D Zero Doom Queen Machinex]]", "[[D/D/D Wave King Caesar]]" ("Dark Contract" searchers) 
  ** "[[D/D Savant Copernicus|Savant Copernicus]]", "[[D/D/D Marksman King Tell]]" (send-to-GY "Dark Contract"/"D/D" searcher)
  ** "[[D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh]]" (place-from-Deck "D/D" Pendulum searcher; [[xenolock]]s player)
  ** "[[D/D Gryphon|Gryphon]]", "[[D/D/D Wise King Solomon|Wise King Solomon]]", "[[D/D Count Surveyor|Count Surveyor]]" ("D/D" searchers)
  ** "[[D/D Savant Thomas|Savant Thomas]]" (summon-from-Deck searcher; 1.5-card Rank 8)
  * Combo pieces:
  ** "[[D/D Swirl Slime|Swirl Slime]]" (Fusion Summoner, hand summoner)
  ** "[[D/D Necro Slime|Necro Slime]]" (Fusion Summoner)
  ** "[[D/D Lamia|Lamia]]", "[[D/D Lance Soldier|Lance Soldier]]", "[[D/D Orthros|Orhtros]]" (Tuner extender)
  ** "[[D/D Gryphon|Gryphon]]", "[[D/D Scale Surveyor|Scale Surveyor]]", "[[D/D/D First King Clovis]]" (extender)
  ** "[[D/D/D Flame King Genghis]]", "[[D/D/D Gust King Alexander]]", "[[D/D/D Flame High King Genghis]]", "[[D/D/D Gust High King Alexander]]" (Extra Deck summon-from-GY advantage generator)
  ** "[[D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss Ragnarok]]" (summon-from-GY advantage generator, removal)
  ** "[[D/D/D Chaos King Apocalypse]]", "[[D/D/D Vice King Requiem]]" ("D/D/D" extender)

  The Deck's combos almost always involve Link Summoning "[[D/D/D Abyss King Gilgamesh]]" to search for two "D/D" Pendulum Monsters at once, and then "climb" into "[[D/D/D Sky King Zeus Ragnarok]] which enables a second Pendulum Summon, and the multiple summon-from-GY advantage generator Extra Deck monsters to pivot between various Extra Deck boss monsters or search out more interruption.

  Major in-archetype endboard pieces typically include the following:

  * Negates: "[[D/D/D Wave High King Caesar]]", "[[D/D/D Cursed King Siegfried]]", "D/D/D Sky King Zeus Ragnarok"
  * Removal: "[[D/D/D Headhunt]]", "[[D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex]]", "D/D/D Zero Doom Queen Machinex"
  * OTK/OTK support: "[[D/D/D Duo-Dawn King Kali Yuga]]"<!--Without a way to summon him on the opponent's turn, he is a de facto OTK support-->, "[[D/D/D/D Dimensional King Arc Crisis]]"

  Notably, while most boss monsters in the archetype are high-Level Synchro, high-Rank Xyz, or Fusion Monsters that require significant setup, "D/D/D Deviser King Deus Machinex" is an easy-to-summon "generic" boss monster that can summon itself over any "D/D/D" monster, guaranteeing a level of field presence regardless of disruptions.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Floodgates:
  ** Anti-swarming or [[search]]ing (e.g. "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Thunder King Rai-Oh]]")
  ** Anti-DARK (e.g. "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]")
  * The Deck's only source of 1-card-combos comes from "[[D/D Savant Kepler]]" or "[[Dark Contract with the Gate]]"; this means that the aformentioned cards becomes easy targets for negations, and the Deck most of the time has to rely on difficult, non-linear 2-card-combos to play through interruptions.
  * The archetype is very [[List of unofficial terms#Xenophobic|xenophobic]]; various effects of the archetype's cards restrict the player from Special Summoning non-Fiend or non-"D/D" monsters (such as "Abyss King Gilgamesh", an important searcher in the Deck).
  * The use of Pendulum Scales and "Dark Contracts" can easily clog up the player's [[Spell & Trap Zone]], preventing the use of staple Spell/Traps.
