  "'''Cloudian'''" ({{Ruby|雲魔物|クラウディアン}} ''Kuraudian'') is an [[archetype]] of cards that is used by [[Adrian Gecko]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, and make their ''[[TCG]]''/''[[OCG]]'' debut in ''[[Gladiator's Assault]]''. All members of the archetype are [[WATER]] [[Fairy]] [[Monster Card|monsters]], with the exceptions of for the [[WIND]] [[Aqua]] "[[Cloudian - Eye of the Typhoon]]" and the [[Fiend]] "[[Cloudian - Ghost Fog]]" & "[[Cloudian - Poison Cloud]]".

  The [[Monster effect|effects]] of most "Cloudian" monsters ensure they [[cannot be destroyed by battle]] while in [[Attack Position]], but are destroyed if in face-up [[Defense Position]], and many "Cloudians" also have their effects [[activate]]d or become active while they have [[Fog Counter]]s.

  == Playing style ==
  "Cloudians" require an advanced degree of skill to use properly, because their usefulness depends on how many Fog Counters there are on the [[field]]. Most "Cloudians" cannot be [[destroyed by battle]], but their low [[ATK]] leaves their [[controller]] open to taking damage unless "[[Spirit Barrier]]" or "[[The Sanctuary in the Sky]]" are used. Once your [[support]] cards are in play, the opponent will find it frustratingly difficult to get past a "Cloudian" Deck's defenses. While the opponent is being stalled, the "Cloudian" user can then generate enough Fog Counters to whittle down the opponent's defenses, eventually leaving them with nothing to protect themselves from the otherwise "weak" monsters.

  A "Cloudian" Deck can focus on [[swarm]]ing the [[field]], on [[destroy]]ing the opponent's cards, on inflicting [[effect damage]] with "[[Natural Disaster]]", on a Stall Victory, on raw Beatdown power with "[[Cloudian - Nimbusman]]", or any combination of the above. "Cloudian - Eye of the Typhoon" can also provide some field [[control]] by messing with the [[battle position]]s of opposing monsters. The seemingly weak monsters in the Deck such as "[[Cloudian - Altus]]", "[[Cloudian - Cirrostratus]]" and "[[Cloudian - Acid Cloud]]" become surprisingly useful with enough Fog Counters on the field. Through cards like "[[Cloudian Squall]]" and "[[Fog Control]]", anyone facing these three puff-balls will quickly find themselves with no monsters, no back row, no hand and no options.  Hence the name: "Cloud Control". A killer combo can be made by using "Cloudian Squall" to put a Fog Counter on "Cloudian Turbulence" every turn. Then you can play a "Cloudian Smoke Ball" and tribute it to play "[[Mecha Sea Dragon Plesion]]", and every turn tribute the "Smoke Ball" that you can play each turn to devastate your opponent's field.

  Also, since most "Cloudians" are Fairy, a good card to add is "[[Athena]]", who can use her effect to Special Summon powerful "Cloudians" from the [[Graveyard]] by sacrificing smaller "Cloudians" like "Cloudian - Smoke Ball".  While the Special Summoning is generally a good idea, bear in mind that most "Cloudians" gain their Fog Counters when they are Normal Summoned.

  The effects of the "Cloudians" work when they have enough Fog Counters to pay for them. The number of Fog Counters they get depends on the number of "Cloudians" on the field when each "Cloudian" is Normal Summoned. Since they have many cards to quickly Summon Cloudians like "[[Cloudian - Sheep Cloud]]" and "[[Cloudian - Turbulence]]", they can quickly swarm the field. The strength of the "Cloudians" lies in their ability to destroy cards using the Fog Counters, limiting the opponent's ability to respond.

  === Fog Counters ===
  These are the main power source for "Cloudian" monsters. These counters should be placed mainly on the "Cloudian"-player's monsters but certain "Cloudian" cards can take advantage of Fog Counters anywhere on the field (e.g. "[[Cloudian - Nimbusman]]", "[[Diamond-Dust Cyclone]]").

  "Cloudians" generally gain Fog Counters when they are [[Normal Summon]]ed. A good way to gradually strengthen your monsters is to have "[[Cloudian Squall]]" out and stalling tools to buy [[turn]]s for accumulating Fog Counters.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * All Level 4 or higher "[[Cloudian]]" monsters destroy themselves if they are in [[Defense Position]]. Therefore, cards such as "[[Level Limit - Area B]]", "[[Stumbling]]", and other effects that change [[battle position]]s can be effective against this Deck.
  * "[[Cloudian]]" monsters are typically heavily dependent on their Normal Summon, in order to gain [[Fog Counter]]s. Since 1 Fog Counter is gained for each "Cloudian" monster on the field, this Deck usually resorts to Special Summons to increase the number of "Cloudian" monsters. Therefore, "[[Slow Life]]" can be effective against this Deck.
  * Since all of this Deck's monsters are [[WATER]] monsters, "[[Diamond Dust]]" can be effective against this Deck.
  * Since all of this Deck's monsters share the same [[Type]] ([[Fairy]]), "[[There Can Be Only One]]" can be effective against this Deck. However, it is not uncommon for this Deck to complement its strategy with other monsters.
  * Since all of this Deck's monsters have 1000 or less [[DEF]], "[[Full Force Virus]]" can be effective against this Deck.
