  "'''Lunalight'''", known as "'''Moonlight'''" (ムーンライト ''Mūnraito'', written as {{Ruby|月光|ムーンライト}}  in the anime) in the [[OCG]], is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] [[Beast-Warrior]] [[Monster card|monsters]] debuting in ''[[Shining Victories]]'' that are used by [[Celina]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''.
  ==Design==
  [[File:Lunalight.png|200px|left|thumb|[[Celina]] with "[[Lunalight Blue Cat]]" and "[[Lunalight Cat Dancer]]" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V|anime]].]]
  The [[Main Deck]] members are named with the pattern "''Lunalight {Color} {Animal}''" (except for the [[Pendulum Monster]]s, which do not have a color in the name). They are visually represented as gymsuit-wearing young girls with animal features, and have a color scheme based on the namesake color. They also wear various crescent moon-shaped accessories, usually over the left eye and the chest. Their overall design is reminiscent of the "[[Cyber Girl]]" archetype, albeit Lunalight monsters' skin and tight are colored less ambiguously.
  The [[Fusion Monster]]s instead are called "''Lunalight {Animal} Dancer''", with the stronger monster being an animal of higher power. They appear as mature-looking women (with animal features as well) wearing long and flowing dresses, and wield cutting and thrusting weapons.
  ==Playing style==
  "Lunalight" focuses on Fusion Summoning, then heads to battle with multiple attack to rack up damage by attacking the same monster multiple times.
  The "Lunalight" [[Fusion Monster]]s involve a straightforward [[battle damage]] strategy. This is bolstered by the ATK changing effects of "[[Lunalight Blue Cat]]" and "[[Lunalight Crimson Fox]]" to run over normally stronger monsters easily, with the Spell/Trap bouncing effect of "[[Lunalight White Rabbit]]" to assist.
  Instead of searching and adding from the Main Deck, "Lunalight" effects recover resources from the Graveyard and need effects like "[[Foolish Burial]]" and "[[Mathematician]]" to assist the revival effects of "[[Lunalight Blue Cat|Blue Cat]]" and "[[Lunalight Tiger|Tiger]]."
  "[[Lunalight White Rabbit|White Rabbit]]" can [[Special Summon]] any "Lunalight" Monster from the Graveyard and then use its effect to Bounce opposing backrow, clearing the way for a follow-up [[Fusion Summon]] and Attacks from those monsters. "[[King of the Swamp]]" and "[[Lunalight Black Sheep]]" can [[discard]] themselves to add "[[Polymerization]]" from the Main Deck to the hand. "Sheep" is also an ideal [[Fusion Material]] as it can recover "Lunalight" Monsters from Graveyard or from the Face-Up Extra Deck. Additionally, "[[Fusion Recovery]]" can be used to recycle "[[Polymerization]]" and any Fusion Material used as well.
  The [[Fusion Monster]]s of this archetype can be Special Summoned with "[[Cattle Call]]" or "[[Fusion Tag]]" in combination with their fusion spell "[[Lunalight Fusion]]" or "[[Polymerization]]" to reach "[[Lunalight Leo Dancer]]" much faster than would normally be expected. "[[Lunalight Kaleido Chick]]" also serves as Fusion Substitute-esque.
  This archetype's ability to manage the number of DARK Monsters is ideal for running "[[Dark Armed Dragon]]".
  ===Weakness===
  * This Deck, like all Special Summon-based Decks, is vulnerable to cards that prevent Special Summons.
  * This Deck is DARK, making it vulnerable to "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]".
