  "'''Lunalight'''", known as "'''Moonlight'''" (ムーンライト ''Mūnraito'', written as {{Ruby|月光|ムーンライト}}  in the anime) in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] [[Beast-Warrior]] [[Monster card|monsters]] used by [[Celina]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime.

  == Design ==
  [[File:Lunalight.png|200px|left|thumb|[[Celina]] with "[[Lunalight Blue Cat]]" and "[[Lunalight Cat Dancer]]" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V|anime]].]]
  The [[Main Deck]] members of the archetype share the naming pattern "''Lunalight {Color} {Animal}''" (except for the [[Pendulum Monster]]s, which do not have a color in their name). Their design is based on young girls with animal features wearing jumpsuits and their color scheme are based on the namesake color. They also wear various crescent moon-shaped accessories, usually over the left eye and the chest. Their overall design is reminiscent of the "[[Cyber Girl]]" archetype, albeit Lunalight monsters' skin and tight are colored less ambiguously.

  The [[Fusion Monster]]s of the archetype (except "[[Lunalight Perfume Dancer]]") share the naming pattern "''Lunalight {Animal} Dancer''", with the stronger members (in terms of higher [[Level]] and [[original ATK and DEF]]) being named after an animal of higher power. Their designs are based on mature-looking young women with animal features wearing long and flowing dresses, and wield cutting and thrusting weapons.

  == Playing style ==
  "Lunalight" focuses on Fusion Summoning, then heads to battle with multiple attack to rack up damage by attacking the same monster multiple times.
  The "Lunalight" [[Fusion Monster]]s involve a straightforward [[battle damage]] strategy. This is bolstered by the ATK changing effects of "[[Lunalight Blue Cat]]" and "[[Lunalight Crimson Fox]]" to run over normally stronger monsters easily, with the Spell/Trap bouncing effect of "[[Lunalight White Rabbit]]" to assist.
  Instead of searching and adding from the Main Deck, "Lunalight" effects recover resources from the Graveyard and need effects like "[[Foolish Burial]]" and "[[Mathematician]]" to assist the revival effects of "[[Lunalight Blue Cat|Blue Cat]]" and "[[Lunalight Tiger|Tiger]]."
  "[[Lunalight White Rabbit|White Rabbit]]" can [[Special Summon]] any "Lunalight" Monster from the Graveyard and then use its effect to Bounce opposing backrow, clearing the way for a follow-up [[Fusion Summon]] and Attacks from those monsters.

  The main beaters include both "[[Lunalight Panther Dancer]]" and "[[Lunalight Leo Dancer]]", both of which can multi-attack in some fashion. "Panther" can do so by preventing monsters it battles from being destroyed by battle once, which aids in both racking up damage against lower-ATK targets and its additional effect to gain ATK upon destroying a monster by battle. "Leo", meanwhile, gains a second attack in general and can destroy all the opponent's monsters after destroying one in battle.

  "[[King of the Swamp]]" and "[[Lunalight Black Sheep]]" can [[discard]] themselves to add "[[Polymerization]]" from the Main Deck to the hand. "Sheep" is also an ideal [[Fusion Material]] as it can recover "Lunalight" Monsters from Graveyard or from the Face-Up Extra Deck. Additionally, "[[Fusion Recovery]]" can be used to recycle "[[Polymerization]]" and any Fusion Material used as well.

  The [[Fusion Monster]]s of this archetype can be Special Summoned with "[[Cattle Call]]" or "[[Fusion Tag]]" in combination with their fusion spell "[[Lunalight Fusion]]" or "[[Polymerization]]" to reach "[[Lunalight Leo Dancer]]" much faster than would normally be expected. "[[Lunalight Kaleido Chick]]" also serves as Fusion Substitute-esque.
  This archetype's ability to manage the number of DARK Monsters is ideal for running "[[Dark Armed Dragon]]".

  Lunalight is also rather adept at [[Xyz Summon]]ing, given the revival effects of "Tiger" and "Yellow Marten". Seeing as the former's is a "soft once-per-turn", the aforementioned "Marten" and "[[Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite]]" in particular can return it to the hand to be placed in the Pendulum Scale again and make use of its revival once more. Afterwards, one can overlay the resulting Level 4 monsters into options such as "[[Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Tiger King]]", "[[Abyss Dweller]]", and "[[Raider's Knight]]".

  === Weakness ===
  * As is the case with many Decks chiefly centered around a single Summoning mechanic, "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" poses a major problem by locking this Deck out of its main beaters. This is slightly circumvented when running [[Xyz Monster]]s, however.
  * With the exception of "[[Lunalight Liger Dancer|Liger Dancer]]", the archetype lacks interaction and is far more adept at going second than first. However, the addition of staple monsters such as "[[Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir]]" can help alleviate this issue.
  * The archetype predominantly utilizes [[DARK]] Monsters, making it vulnerable to cards that debilitate or exploit specific opposing [[Attributes]] such as "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" and the "[[Bystial]]" monsters.
