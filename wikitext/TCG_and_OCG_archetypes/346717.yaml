  "'''Lunalight'''", known as "'''Moonlight'''" (ムーンライト ''Mūnraito'', written as {{Ruby|月光|ムーンライト}}  in the anime) in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] [[Beast-Warrior]] [[Monster card|monsters]] used by [[Celina]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime.

  == Design ==
  [[File:Lunalight.png|200px|left|thumb|[[Celina]] with "[[Lunalight Blue Cat]]" and "[[Lunalight Cat Dancer]]" in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V|anime]].]]
  The [[Main Deck]] members of the archetype share the naming pattern "''Lunalight {Color} {Animal}''" (except for the [[Pendulum Monster]]s, which do not have a color in their name). Their design is based on young girls with animal features wearing jumpsuits and their color scheme are based on the namesake color. They also wear various crescent moon-shaped accessories, usually over the left eye and the chest. Their overall design is reminiscent of the "[[Cyber Girl]]" archetype, albeit "Lunalight" monsters' skin and tights are colored less ambiguously.

  The [[Fusion Monster]]s of the archetype (except "[[Lunalight Perfume Dancer]]") share the naming pattern "''Lunalight {Animal} Dancer''", with the stronger members (in terms of higher [[Level]] and [[original ATK and DEF]]) being named after an animal of higher power. Their designs are based on mature-looking young women with animal features wearing long and flowing dresses, and wield cutting and thrusting weapons.

  == Playing style ==
  "Lunalight" focuses on Fusion Summoning. Their Main Deck monsters' effects mainly revolve around searching the necessary pieces needed for the Fusion Summon, either searching cards from the Deck to the hand or sending monsters from the Deck to recover them later. "[[Lunalight Gold Leo]]" acts as their main searcher. "[[Lunalight Black Sheep]]" can [[discard]] itself to add "[[Polymerization]]" from the Main Deck to the hand. "Black Sheep" is also an ideal [[Fusion Material]] as it can recover "Lunalight" monsters from Graveyard or from the face-up Extra Deck. "[[Lunalight Kaleido Chick]] and "[[Lunalight Masquerade|Masquerade]]" can also recover "Polymerization". "Lunalight" monsters sentto the GY to be revived later by the effects of "[[Lunalight Blue Cat|Blue Cat]]", "[[Lunalight White Rabbit|White Rabbit]]" or "[[Lunalight Tiger|Tiger]]", or trigger the effects of monsters such as "[[Lunalight Silver Hound]]" which can Special Summon a "Lunalight" monster from the Deck, or add back to the hand with "Gold Leo".

  Their [[Fusion Monster]]s have straightforward [[battle]]-oriented and/or protective effects. Many of them can attack multiple times, and their battling capabilities are bolstered by the ATK changing effects of "[[Lunalight Blue Cat]]" and "[[Lunalight Crimson Fox]]" to run over normally stronger monsters easily, with the Spell/Trap bouncing effect of "[[Lunalight White Rabbit]]" to assist.

  The main beaters include both "[[Lunalight Panther Dancer]]" and "[[Lunalight Leo Dancer]]", both of which can multi-attack in some fashion. "Panther" can do so by preventing monsters it battles from being destroyed by battle once, which aids in both racking up damage against lower-ATK targets and its additional effect to gain ATK upon destroying a monster by battle. "Leo", meanwhile, gains a second attack in general and can destroy all the opponent's monsters after destroying one in battle. "[[Lunalight Liger Dancer]]", introduced in ''[[Duelist's Advance]]'', provide the archetype with a difficult-to-remove interruption in the form of a near-"[[Unaffected by other card effects|towers]]" monster with a soft-OPT boardwipe effect.

  The "successive [[counterpart|evolution]]" of "Cat Dancer" ("Panther Dancer", "Leo Dancer", and "Liger Dancer") all require the previous form as material for their Fusion Summon. They can be Fusion Summoned more easily with "[[Fusion Tag]]" or "Kaleido Chick" (for being able to treat a monster or itself as one of the Fusion Monster names when used as material for a Fusion Summon, respectively). "[[Lunalight Fusion]]" or "[[Heavy Polymerization]]" can use materials from the Extra Deck under the right situations (incidentally, both require the opponent to control a monster while the former requires that opponent's monster to be one that is Special Summoned from the Extra Deck) while "[[Lunalight Wolf|Wolf]]" and "Masquerade" can banish materials from the GY for their Fusion Summon effects.

  "Lunalight" is also rather adept at [[Xyz Summon]]ing, given the revival effects of "Tiger" and "Yellow Marten". Seeing as the former's is a "soft once-per-turn", the aforementioned "Marten" and "[[Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite]]" in particular can return it to the hand to be placed in the Pendulum Scale again and make use of its revival once more. Afterwards, one can use the two resulting Level 4 monsters into Xyz options such as "[[Brotherhood of the Fire Fist - Tiger King]]", "[[Abyss Dweller]]", and "[[Raider's Knight]]", or even perform a psuedo-lockdown by summoning "[[Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir]]" while "Liger Dancer" is already on the field to lock any non-Link monster except "Liger Dancer" from card effects.

  === Weakness ===
  * As is the case with many Decks chiefly centered around a single Summoning mechanic, "[[Dimensional Barrier]]" and "[[Non-Fusion Area]]" pose a major problem by locking this Deck out of its main beaters. This is slightly circumvented when running [[Xyz Monster]]s, however.
  * With the exception of "[[Lunalight Liger Dancer|Liger Dancer]]", "[[Lunalight Silver Hound|Silver Hound]]" or "[[Lunalight Crimson Fox]]", the archetype lacks interaction and is far more adept at going second than first. However, the addition of staple monsters such as "[[Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir]]" can help alleviate this issue.
  * The archetype predominantly utilizes [[DARK]] Monsters, making it vulnerable to cards that debilitate or exploit specific opposing [[Attributes]] such as "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]" and the "[[Bystial]]" monsters.
