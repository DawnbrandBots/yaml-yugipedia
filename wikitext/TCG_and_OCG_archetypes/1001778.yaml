  "'''Vaalmonica'''", known as "'''Varmonica'''" (ヴァルモニカ ''Varumonika'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Fiend]] and [[Fairy]] monsters introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Valiant Smashers]]''.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#No. 06: Vaalmonica}}

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  The theme contains many Italian words. In light of this, its name is possibly a wordplay between the word "Variare" ("to vary", in reference to the choice effects on every card) and "Armonica", which is the translation of both "[[wikipedia:Glass harmonica|harmonica]]" (the instrument depicted on the [[Field Spell Card]]) and "harmonic" (from which the music-themed names of the [[Trap Card]]s may be derived).

  "[[Angello Vaalmonica]]" and "[[Dimonno Vaalmonica]]" are based on the concept of a "[[wikipedia:Shoulder angel|shoulder angel and devil]]" (their names being distorted versions of the Italian words "Angelo" and "Demone"), a dramatic interpretation and visualization of one's individual [[wikipedia:Conscience|conscience]] that drives them to make morally good or evil decisions and symbolize the inner struggle of a person's choices.

  ==Playing style==
  "Vaalmonica" is a theme that revolves around manipulation of the user's Life Point in tandem with its two [[Pendulum Monster]]s, "[[Angello Vaalmonica]]" and "[[Dimonno Vaalmonica]]", specifically their [[Pendulum Effect]]s to gain [[Resonance Counter]]s when gaining LP (in the case of "Angello") and taking damage (for "Dimonno"). Once 3 or more "Resonance Counters" have been gained on a respective [[Pendulum Scale]], the player can proceed to [[Link Summon]] the theme's 2 [[Link-1]] boss monsters; "[[Zebufera, Vaalmonican Hallow Heathen]]" and "[[Duralume, Vaalmonican Heathen Hallow]]", a duo of stronger monsters limited merely through this condition to Summon them.
