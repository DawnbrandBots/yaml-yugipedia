  "'''Fishborg'''" (フィッシュボーグ ''Fisshubōgu'') is an [[archetype]] of low-[[Level]] [[WATER]] [[Fish]] [[Monster Card|monsters]].

  == Design ==
  The name of the archetype is a portmanteau of the words "fish" and "cyborg". Aesthetically, with the exception of "Doctor", they are water-based organisms controlling robotic suits from inside water-filled bowls thanks to antennas they have on their heads. However, despite the name, only few of them are actually fishes. Specifically, the progenitor of the archetype, "Blaster", released during the [[Synchro]] era, and its later member, "Harpooner", released during the [[Link]] era, are based on fishes that exist in the real world. The four members released during the [[Xyz]] era are instead based on other kind of animals and what seems to be the human scientist that built them.

  == Playing style ==
  Due to their lack of support and consistency, "Fishborg" monsters are generally used as [[engine]]s for WATER-oriented Decks, mainly those ones capable of performing Synchro Summons. All of them have the ability of Special Summoning themselves from the Graveyard if a certain condition is met or if a cost is paid. In the case of "[[Fishborg Blaster]]", that cost is a WATER monster discard, which in turn, if combined with "[[Atlantean]]"/"[[Mermail]]" monsters or "[[Superancient Deepsea King Coelacanth]]" could provide huge card advantage and enable powerful [[OTK]]s. Also, due to the fact it can indefinetely revive itself as long as that cost is paid, it has been [[Forbidden]] since 2011. All "Fishborg" monsters are watered down versions of "Blaster", but, with the proper set-up, they can effectively be used to set-up the Synchro Summon of powerful monsters, such as "[[Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]", "[[White Aura Whale]]", etc.
