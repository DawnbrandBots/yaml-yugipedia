  "'''Fishborg'''" (フィッシュボーグ ''Fisshubōgu'') is an [[archetype]] of low-[[Level]] [[WATER]] [[Fish]] [[Monster Card|monsters]].

  == Design ==
  Aesthetically, with the exception of "Doctor", they are fish (or water-based organisms) controlling robotic suits from inside water-filled bowls. The word is a portemeneau of words "fish" and "cyborg".

  == Playing style ==
  Due to their lack of support and consistency, "Fishborg" monsters are generally used as [[engine]]s for WATER-oriented Decks, mainly those ones capable of performing Synchro Summons. All of them have the ability of Special Summoning themselves from the Graveyard if a certain condition is met or if a cost is paid. In the case of "[[Fishborg Blaster]]", that cost is a WATER monster discard, which in turn, if combined with "[[Atlantean]]"/"[[Mermail]]" monsters or "[[Superancient Deepsea King Coelacanth]]" could provide huge card advantage and enable powerful [[OTK]]s. Also, due to the fact it can indefinetely revive itself as long as that cost is paid, it has been [[Forbidden]] since 2011. All "Fishborg" monsters are watered down versions of "Blaster", but, with the proper set-up, they can effectively be used to set-up the Synchro Summon of powerful monsters, such as "[[Trishula, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]", "[[White Aura Whale]]", etc.
