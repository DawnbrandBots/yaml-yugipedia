  "'''Cyber Dragon'''" (サイバー・ドラゴン ''Saibā Doragon'') is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Machine]] monsters based on "[[Cyber Dragon]]". It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Cyber]]" archetype. "Cyber Dragon" cards are used by [[Zane Truesdale]], then later by [[Syrus Truesdale]], in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (manga)|manga]]''. First released in 2005 as a [[series]], it received its first full support in ''[[Structure Deck: Blitzkrieg of the Mechlight Dragons]]'' in 2013. The series was [[Cyber Dragon (Rush Duel series)|later released]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duel]]'' in ''[[Over Rush Pack]]'', featuring ''Rush Duel''-original cards.

  The "[[Chimeratech]]" monsters are [[DARK]] Machine [[Fusion Monster]]s which are related to the "Cyber Dragon" archetype, but are not members of it; they each require either a "Cyber Dragon" or "Cyber Dragon" monster as their Fusion Materials.

  == Design ==
  === Members ===
  The "Cyber Dragon" monsters, aside from "[[Cyber Dragon]]" itself (and its [[Toon Monster]] direct counterpart "[[Toon Cyber Dragon]]"), can be divided into several subcategories.

  ==== Pre-Cyber Dragons ====
  These are two monsters that are considered in-universe to be precede the initial "Cyber Dragon", with "[[Proto-Cyber Dragon]]" being a prototype, and "[[Cyber Dragon Core]]" being "Cyber Dragon" before being outfitted with its external shell.

  ==== Cyber Dragons with German Names ====
  Some "Cyber Dragon" monsters have German words in their names, possibly referencing [[Zane Truesdale]]'s title of "Kaiser" in the anime and manga.

  ==== Retrofitted Cyber Dragons ====
  There are two specific monsters that depict "Cyber Dragon" monster retrofitted into different forms focusing on either full assault or protection through the effect of two specific [[Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s. One of these monsters is also remade for ''Rush Duel'' as a different monster that still reference its original ''OCG''/''TCG'' incarnation. Take note that due to their naming, they are not actually part of the "Cyber Dragon" archetype itself.

  ==== Fusion Monsters ====
  {{See also|Chimeratech}}
  There are several LIGHT or DARK Machine [[Fusion Monster]]s that support "Cyber Dragon" or its archetype, but lack the "Cyber Dragon" archetypal name. The DARK monsters among them also form their own monster [[series]], [[Chimeratech]]. These Fusion Monsters typically depict multiples of "Cyber Dragons" amalgamated into one being.

  |}

  ==== Xyz Monsters ====
  There are exactly two "Cyber Dragon" Xyz Monsters, the Rank 5 "[[Cyber Dragon Nova]]" and the Rank 6 "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]", with the latter being an upgraded form of the former that can even be Xyz Summoned using the former by itself.

  ==== Other "Cyber Dragon"-Related ====
  There are also other "Cyber" monsters that aren't part of the "Cyber Dragon" archetype nor fit into the preceding categories, but still have visual design based on "Cyber Dragon" and are related outside of gameplay. These are "[[Cyber Larva]]", "[[Cyber Valley]]", "[[Cyber Dinosaur]]", "[[Cyber Phoenix]]", "[[Cyber Kirin]]", "[[Cyber Ouroboros]]", "[[Cyber Eltanin]]", and "[[Cyber Jormungardr]]".

  == Playing style ==
  The "Cyber Dragon" archetype is often built as a blind-second [[OTK]] Deck, defeating the opponent with their powerful [[Fusion Monster]]s, and potentially able to clear the opponent's field through [[Contact Fusion]]. It is secondarily focused on controlling the game state with the Xyz Monster "[[Cyber Dragon Infinity]]". As of ''[[Alliance Insight]]'', going first is also reasonable.

  The Main Deck low-Level "Cyber Dragon" monsters serve as the Deck's main Normal Summons and supportive monsters. Several of them share the effect to change their name to "Cyber Dragon" while in the Field/GY; this supports certain card effects that require the presence of "Cyber Dragon", "[[Machine Duplication]]", and Fusion Material requirements specifying "Cyber Dragon". Of these monsters, the key ones are "Core", "Nachster", and "Herz".

  * GY effect provides comeback capabilities.

  |-
  | [[Cyber Dragon Herz|Herz]]
  |
  * Advantage-neutral discard target for "Nachster" and "[[Galaxy Soldier]]".
  * Second effect can situationally be used for Xyz plays.
  |}

  "Cyber Dragon" Extra Deck monsters have varied effects and varied applications: the Fusion Monsters focus on raw damage output, two "Chimeratech" Fusion Monsters feature [[Contact Fusion|unique Summoning conditions]] that let them act as special forms of removal, the Xyz Monsters focus on controlling the game state, and the Link Monster provides situational utility.

  To summon "Nova" and "Infinity", the archetype aims to swarm Level 5 Machine monsters, such as:
  * Using "[[Machine Duplication]]" on a low-level "Cyber Dragon" monster, whose name is treated as "Cyber Dragon".
  * Summon "[[Galaxy Soldier]]" by discarding "[[Cyber Dragon Herz|Herz]]", triggering both of their effects to get another "Galaxy Soldier" and another "Cyber Dragon", then summon the second "Galaxy Soldier".
  * Using "[[Cyber Jormungardr]]" to Summon itself and "[[Cyber Dragon]]" if the opponent controls a monster.

  Most of the supporting Spells/Traps are part of the broader "[[Cyber]]" archetype, which "Cyber Dragon Core" can search. "[[Cyber Repair Plant]]" and "[[Cyber Emergency]]" can search "Cyber Dragon" and/or LIGHT Machine monsters in general (including "Galaxy Soldier" for "Cyber Repair Plant"), "[[Cyber Revsystem]]" is a searchable GY reborn Spell, "[[Cyberload Fusion]]" is a searchable Quick-Play Fusion Spell that can recycle banished monsters, and "[[Cybernetic Overflow]]" is a Trap Card that can destroy multiple opposing cards without targeting.

  === With Cyberdarks ===
  The "Cyber Dragon" archetype has some overlapping support with the "[[Cyberdark]]" archetype. In particular, a package of "[[Cyberdark Realm]]", "[[Cyberdark Chimera]]", and "[[Cyberdark Wurm]]" can be run to enable combos. "Realm" searches and Normal Summons a "Cyberdark" monster, and can be searched by "[[Cyber Dragon Core]]". "Chimera" can discard a card to search "[[Power Bond]]", and when sent to GY, sends a "Cyberdark" monster from Deck to GY. "Wurm" is the prime target for "Chimera"; it can send a "Cyber Dragon" monster from Deck to GY for [[cost]], to Special Summon itself from hand/GY and recover a "Cyber" Spell from GY. "Wurm" is also a Level 5 monster that treats itself as "Cyber Dragon".

  A more dedicated "Cyber Dragon"-"Cyberdark" hybrid Deck will lean more towards the "Cyberdark" playstyle, and is thus described on the "[[Cyberdark]]" page.

  === External Cards ===
  Many cards in the archetype lock the player into Machine monsters, though there are a variety of options available. 

  * The Deck can search any LIGHT Machine through "[[Cyber Repair Plant]]". "[[Jizukiru, the Star Destroying Kaiju]]" can be included as a standard "[[Kaiju]]" who can then be used "Chimeratech Fortress Dragon" or attached to "Cyber Dragon Infinity. Another notable LIGHT Machine monster is "[[Arcjet Lightcraft]]", which can be summoned with the discard effect of "Cyber Dragon Nachster" and grants an access to Rank 9 Machine Xyz pool.

  * "[[Clockwork Night]]" turns all monsters on field into Machines, enabling the opponent's monsters to be Contact Fused into "Chimeratech Fortress Dragon". It can be searched by "[[Clockwork Knight]]" sending "Cyberdark Realm".

  * The archetype can also search EARTH Machines through the GY effect of "Clockwork Night", as well as the Rank 5 "[[Infinitrack River Stormer]]". One notable card is "[[Therion "King" Regulus]]" as an omni-negate.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * As an archetype of LIGHT and DARK Machine monsters, specific Attribute and Typing counters such as "[[Bystial]]s" and "[[System Down]]" can hamper the deck's effectiveness.
  * Some key cards of the archetype, such as "Cyber Repair Plant" and "Cyber Revsystem", require the Graveyard to be set up in order to be used to its full effect. As such, cards that [[banish]] cards that would be sent to GY, such as "[[Dimension Shifter]]" and "[[Macro Cosmos]]" can slow down the deck. Though this is somewhat remedied by the effects of "Cyberload Fusion" and "[[Cyber Network]]".
  * "Chimeratech Fortress Dragon" and "Chimeratech Megafleet Dragon", despite being related to the archetype, can function as counters against the archetype itself; a "Cyber Dragon" player's opponent can use all the "Cyber Dragon" monsters and Machine monsters on the established "Cyber Dragon" field into materials to summon "Fortress Dragon" and "Megafleet Dragon", demolishing the field without giving a chance for a counterplay.
