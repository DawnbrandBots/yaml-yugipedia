  "'''Springans'''", known as "'''Sprigguns'''" (スプリガンズ ''Supuriganzu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[FIRE]] [[Machine]] monsters, with the exception of the [[DARK]] [[Beast]] "[[Springans Kitt]]", that debuted in ''[[Blazing Vortex]]''.

  The "Springans" archetype shares the same universe as the "[[Dogmatika]]" and "[[Tri-Brigade]]" archetypes, as seen in the artworks of their Spells and Traps. 

  After Albaz and Ecclesia escaped Dogmatika with the help of Shuraig and the Tri-Brigade, they wandered in the great sand sea Golgonda. There they were captured by the Springans and brought upon their ship. While discussing their fates, Kitt, a young Tri-Brigade member living with the Springans in the desert, saw that the little mechanical bird Mercourier was with them and knew they were friends. After Albaz and Ecclesia passed the trial given to them by the Springans, they were welcomed as part of the team. 

  A while after they faced off against the great serpent of the Golgonda desert, they gave a parting gift to Albaz and Ecclesia and said their goodbyes, all except a small Springan that hid in the new hammer Ecclesia made from the skull loot from her trial. After going their separate ways, Kitt didn't feel so good leaving their new friends to their fate. She traveled along with Sargas to the land of iron where the Therion Discolosseum was so they could acquire the power to fight the forces of evil that were the Dogmatika and the Despia. After entering the arena, the overseer of the entire place, Argyro, agreed to allow them only if one of them could beat every fighter of the colosseum. Sargas faced off against all of them with Kitt cheering him on. After defeating every Therion, even "King" Regulus, Argyro was so angry that his fighters lost that it created a new enemy to eradicate Kitt and the Springans: the Spright. After a brutal battle and the team-up of Sargas and Regulus, Argyro was defeated. The Springans got access to the power they needed and started preparing the weapons for the final fight against the true enemy. 

  During the final fight, while everything seemed hopeless, Kitt and the Springans appeared to save the day. Kitt gave Shuraig a new powerful weapon to use and he, along with a newly upgraded Sargas who was now the Champion of the Therion arena, defeated the biggest of the Bystials, the humongous Alba Los.

  ==Etymology==
  Springans is a portmanteau between spring gun and [[wikipedia:Spriggan|Spriggan]]s, which are legendary creatures from the fairy tradition of [[wikipedia:Cornish mythology|Cornish mythology]]. Spriggans are especially associated with [[wikipedia:West Penwith|West Penwith]] in [[wikipedia:Cornwall|Cornwall]].

  ==Design==
  [[File:SpringansRockey-ConceptArt.png|thumb|left|200px|Concept art of "[[Springans Rockey]]".]]
  The "Springans" monsters are soot-based life forms wearing missile, torpedo, and cannon armor. Some, such as "[[Springans Rockey|Rockey]]", can fold their bodies into their respective weapons to attack.

  Some "Springans" and other associated cards, such as "[[Springans Ship - Exblowrer]]", "[[Springans Blast!]]", and "[[Sprind the Irondash Dragon]]" features a zone-related effects that affect cards within and around that zone, emulating an explosion effect.

  ==Playing style==
  All [[Main Deck]] "Springans" monsters (except Springans Kitt) share the same [[effect]], which allows them to [[attach]] themselves from the [[hand]], [[field]] or [[GY]] to a "Springans" [[Xyz Monster]] the player controls. Combined with the [[Field Spell]] "[[Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda]]", which can [[Special Summon]] a "Springans" Xyz Monster from the [[Extra Deck]] if the player does not control one, they can bring out their Xyz Monsters without having to gather [[material]]s on the field to [[Xyz Summon]] it, and re-attach materials to it each turn.

  Their Xyz Monster, "[[Springans Ship - Exblowrer]]", has an effect to [[destroy]] a number of the opponent's cards equal to the number of materials detached, and another to [[banish]] itself until the [[End Phase]]. Combining this with the other "Springans", "Ship - Exblowrer" can destroy several of the opponent's cards during the player's turn, and banish itself during the opponent's to protect itself and repeat the process.

  While "Ship - Exblowrer" can destroy cards during the player's turn, "[[Springans Captain Sargas]]" can detach materials from other Xyz Monsters to destroy 1 face-up card during the opponent's turn. "[[Springans Call!]]" can Special Summon 1 "Springans" monsters from the GY. Since Xyz Monsters Special Summoned by "Great Sand Sea - Gold Golgonda" cannot be Special Summoned back from the GY, "Springans Call!" can Summon "Captain Sargas" instead, in order to use its effect.

  As they don't necessarily have to use monsters to Xyz Summon, they can instead use their [[Normal Summon]] on monsters such as "[[Scrap Recycler]]" to [[send]] "Springans" from the Deck to the GY. In addition, the player can also opt to run "[[Scrap Golem]]", "[[Crystron Rosenix]]", "[[Scrap Wyvern]]", and "[[Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion]]", which will send 2 "Springans" instead. "Recycler" can send "Rosenix" to the GY, which can Special Summon 1 "[[Crystron Token]]". Both "Recycler" and the Token can be used to Summon "Wyvern", then its effect can Summon "Golem" from the Deck, and "Golem" can Summon back "Recycler" from the GY, activating its effect to send 1 Machine monster to the GY. Next, all of the three "Scrap" monsters can be used to Summon "Curious", sending another card from the Deck to the GY. This can be combined with "[[Springans Brothers]]", which can Special Summon the other "Springans" monster sent to the GY with this combo.
