  "'''Koa'ki Meiru'''", Japanese for "'''Core Chimail'''" (コアキメイル ''Koakimeiru''), is an [[archetype]] debuted in ''[[Raging Battle]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|Master Guide 3 card storylines#File Number 05: Koa'ki Meiru}}
  According to "[[Iron Core Specimen Lab]]", "[[Kozaky]]" and "[[Magical Scientist]]" experimented and created the "Koa'ki Meiru" Monsters.

  == Etymology ==
  "Koa'ki Meiru" is a combination of the words "Core", "Chimera" and "Mail", sometimes romanized as "Core Chimair" (a combination of the words "Core" and "Chimera").

  == Design ==
  The "Koa'ki Meiru" archetype consists of a plethora of different creatures, featuring elementals, dragons, statues, warriors and many more and can overall be described as a mishmash of art styles. They don't really have any connection in design or color, except for the fact that all of the "Koa'ki Meirus" have the same mark (3 dragons) on some part of their body or on a weapon they use.

  == Playing style ==
  "Koa'ki Meiru" is a [[stun]]/[[control]] Deck revolving around fulfilling its monsters' [[maintenance cost]]s in order to keep them on the field and apply their field-controlling effects. Secondarily, the archetype revolves around interactions with the Normal Spell "[[Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru]]".
  Almost every "Koa'ki Meiru" monster has a maintenance cost that must be performed during each of the player's [[End Phase]]s, otherwise they will destroy themselves. "Koa'ki Meiru" monsters typically have a choice of two actions for their maintenance costs; the options are typically sending an "Iron Core" from the player's hand to the Graveyard, or revealing a card in the player's hand (typically a monster of their same type).

  In gameplay, "Koa'ki Meiru" monsters have a variety of effects, ranging from consistency support, battle, destruction, or negation focused effects. A number of "Koa'ki Meiru" monsters (e.g. "[[Koa'ki Meiru Drago|Drago]]" and "[[Koa'ki Meiru Doom|Doom]]") have effects focused on countering [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] monsters (which were likely intended as "anti-meta" options against their contemporary LIGHT and DARK-based meta Decks).
  Four Level 4 EARTH Rock "Koa'ki Meiru" monsters ("[[Koa'ki Meiru Overload|Overload]]", "[[Koa'ki Meiru Guardian|Guardian]]", "[[Koa'ki Meiru Sandman|Sandman]]", "[[Koa'ki Meiru Wall|Wall]]") also form a thematic sub-series with a single effect pattern: each of them can [[negate]] an opponent's action (summoning a monster or activating a card/effect of a card type) by tributing themselves.
  "Koa'ki Meiru" cards can be played as staples in other Typing-focused Decks, or played as a single dedicated Deck. As a dedicated "Koa'ki Meiru" Deck, the Deck primarily focuses on the Level 4 EARTH Rock "Koa'ki Meiru" monsters due to their accessibility, power, and synergy with [[Rock]] support; they form a part of the popular "[[Rock Stun]]" Deck.
  The Deck's main searchers are "[[Diamond Core of Koa'ki Meiru]]", "[[Koa'ki Meiru Urnight]]", and "[[Koa'ki Meiru Supplier]]". Aside from the "Rock Stun" "Koa'ki Meiru" monsters, other relevant high-power (and low-cost) "Koa'ki Meiru" monsters include the LIGHT and DARK hard counters "[[Koa'ki Meiru Drago]]" and "[[Koa'ki Meiru Doom]]", the card-destroying "[[Koa'ki Meiru Ice]]" and "[[Koa'ki Meiru Tornado]]", and the mass effect negation of "[[Koa'ki Meiru Hydro Barrier]]".
  While "Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru" is central to the archetype's playstyle, and there are multiple dedicated searchers for it (e.g. "[[Core Transport Unit]]"), the fact that the card doesn't have any effects itself and is purely an enabler for certain specific cards means that more modern "Koa'ki Meiru" will typically try to downplay its importance, in favor of other external enablers (and maintenance cost providers) like "[[Adamancipator]]" monsters.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The Deck's reliance on "Iron Core of Koa'ki Meiru", which has no notable effects itself, means that a "Koa'ki Meiru" Deck that focuses on "Iron Core" can run into issues with dead draws.
  * A major weakness is the archetypes own maintenance effect. If the player is not careful and summons multiple "Koa'ki Meiru" monsters to the field without thought, it can easily blow up if one is not able to pay all the costs.
  ** Additionally, cards such as "[[Respect Play]]" or "[[Ceremonial Bell]]" can eliminate the majority of the alternative maintenance costs by making it impossible to reveal any cards. In that case, one would be forced to rely on sending "Iron Core" to satisfy maintenance costs.
  * "Koa'ki Meiru" monsters are very reliant on the hand, therefore any form of "Hand Control" presents a big threat by being able to specifically remove assets essential to the Deck. Cards like "[[Card Destruction]]", "[[Mind Crush]]", "[[D.D. Designator]]" and "[[Trap Dustshoot]]" can completely disrupt the player's strategy.
  * Like many other decks, "Koa'ki Meiru" does not appreciate its Summons to be negated or blocked. "[[Solemn Warning]]", "[[Solemn Judgment]]", "[[Archlord Kristya]]", "[[Vanity's Fiend]]" or "[[Vanity's Emptiness]]" are all effective against the deck.
