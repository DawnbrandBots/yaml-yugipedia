  "'''Palladium'''", known as "'''Palladium Priest'''" ({{Ruby|守|しゅ}}{{Ruby|護|ご}}{{Ruby|神|しん}}{{Ruby|官|かん}} ''Shugo Shinkan'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] [[Spellcaster]] monsters used by [[Dark Yugi (manga)|Atem]] in the film ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions]]''. They are based on Atem's faithful servants during his time as the Pharaoh thousands of years in the past.
  The archetype currently consists of only 2 members, "[[Palladium Oracle Mana|Mana]]" and "[[Palladium Oracle Mahad|Mahad]]", and did not become an archetype until it received support in "[[Soul Servant]]". The archetype revolves around supporting and protecting the "[[Dark Magician (archetype)|Dark Magician]]" archetype. Both members can [[Special Summon]]  themselves, and also have a [[Floater|floating]] effect that in turn Special Summons a "[[Dark Magician (archetype)|Dark Magician]]" monster upon destruction, where Mahad and Mana can float into "[[Dark Magician]]" and "[[Dark Magician Girl]]" respectively.
