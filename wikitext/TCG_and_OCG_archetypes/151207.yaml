  "'''Mokey Mokey'''" (もけもけ ''Mokemoke'') is an [[archetype]] of cards used by [[Belowski]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime. Members have existed since ''[[Pharaoh's Inheritance]]''/''[[Ancient Sanctuary]]'', but received no support until ''[[Power of the Elements]]''.

  == Play style ==
  The Deck is based on increasing the [[ATK]] of multiple copies of "[[Mokey Mokey]]" using "[[Mokey Mokey Smackdown]]".
  If "[[Junk Warrior]]" is [[Synchro Summon]]ed after "Mokey Mokey Smackdown" goes off, it will have at least 5300 [[ATK]].

  === Weaknesses ===
  "Mokey Mokey" monsters are very weak, so the player will not be able to [[destroy]] opponent's monsters except with effects (or monsters that have enough [[ATK]] to destroy at least some monsters). Also, there is a little chance that the player may get "[[Mokey Mokey Smackdown]]" and at least 1 "Mokey Mokey" in their first turn of every [[Duel]]. All that is needed to make this Deck weak is to destroy "Mokey Mokey Smackdown", because the multiple copies of "Mokey Mokey" will not gain any ATK bonus from it.
