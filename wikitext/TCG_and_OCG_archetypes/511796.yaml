  "'''Gravekeeper's'''", known as "'''Gravekeeper'''" ({{Ruby|墓|はか}}{{Ruby|守|もり}} ''Hakamori'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] based on ancient Egyptian tomb-keepers. The theme is heavily related to the "[[Necrovalley (archetype)|Necrovalley]]" archetype of Spell and Trap cards, and its strategy revolves around the eponymous "[[Necrovalley]]" Field Spell.
  In Japanese, the archetype was originally known as "'''Gravekeeper's'''" ({{Ruby|墓|はか}}{{Ruby|守|もり}}の ''Hakamori no''), but was changed to just "'''Gravekeeper'''" ({{Ruby|墓|はか}}{{Ruby|守|もり}} ''Hakamori'') with the print of "[[Gravekeeper's Priestess]]" in ''[[Advanced Tournament Pack 2013 Vol.4]]'' in 2014. All subsequent "Gravekeeper's" support printed or reprinted in the Japanese ''OCG'' use the new name.
  [[Gravekeeper's Chief (character)|Gravekeeper's Chief]] and [[Yasmin|Assailant]] appeared as characters in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]''.

  == Design ==
  === Members ===
  ==== Character counterparts ====
  The "Gravekeeper's" monsters that were released in ''[[Starstrike Blast]]'' and ''[[Absolute Powerforce]]'' bear a strong resemblance to members of the Ishtar family, who are a family of [[Tomb Keeper]]s in the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|manga]]. Additionally, one "Gravekeeper's" monster released in ''[[Legacy of the Valiant]]'' bears resemblance to [[Thief King Bakura]], an ancient Egyptian character from the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime and manga.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Gravekeeper's" archetype is a [[stun]] Deck revolving around the [[Field Spell]] "[[Necrovalley]]". "Necrovalley" is a [[floodgate]] that prevents both players from moving cards out of either [[Graveyard]], shutting down large amounts of interactions and combos that involve the Graveyard. It is supported by "Gravekeeper's" monsters, who can search out "Necrovalley" and have simple beatdown-based effects, and numerous supporting Spell/Traps with further floodgating effects, such as "[[Royal Tribute]]" or "[[Hidden Temples of Necrovalley]]".

  Individual "Gravekeeper's" monsters typically have simple searching, offensive, or defensive effects. Due to their comparatively lower power level, most "Gravekeeper's" decks focus on the floodgating effects of "Necrovalley" and its supporting Spell/Traps, using the "Gravekeeper's" monsters as searchers and beatsticks. In this role, the key "Gravekeeper's" monsters are "[[Gravekeeper's Commandant|Commandant]]", who can search for "Necrovalley" by discarding itself, and "[[Gravekeeper's Priestess|Priestess]]", who treats the field as "Necrovalley" with its effect.

  For additional, easily accessible board presence, the Deck primarily relies on "[[Gravekeeper's Spiritualist|Spiritualist]]", who can perform a Fusion Summon to summon the archetype's Fusion Monster, "[[Gravekeeper's Supernaturalist|Supernaturalist]]", and "[[Gravekeeper's Headman|Headman]]", who revives a Level 4 "Gravekeeper's" monster on Normal Summon (without being affected by "Necrovalley"). The Deck's main search spell is "[[Necrovalley Throne]]".

  The "Necrovalley"-related Spell/Traps are the Deck's main victory conditions, and most of them require "Necrovalley" and/or controlling a "Gravekeeper's" monster to function. These include "[[Royal Tribute]]", which forces both players to discard all monsters in their hand, "[[Hidden Temples of Necrovalley]]", which prevents both players from Special Summoning non-"Gravekeeper's" monsters, and "[[Imperial Tombs of Necrovalley]]", a [[Counter Trap]] negate.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The deck lacks accessible searchers for its Spell/Traps that are not "Necrovalley", making its game plan slow and inconsistent.
  * The deck lacks strong and easily accessible swarming or boss monster options, making its monster boards extremely fragile.
  * As the deck revolves around "Necrovalley", removing "Necrovalley" shuts down the Deck instantly.
  * As a DARK-based Deck, the Deck is countered by anti-DARK cards like "[[Consecrated Light]]" or "[[Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror]]".

  == Trivia ==
  * Though the archetype was not used by [[Ishizu Ishtar]] and [[Marik Ishtar]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime, it became retroactively associated with them; the two are shown using "Gravekeeper's" cards in some video games, and ''[[Structure Deck: Marik (TCG)|Structure Deck: Marik]]'' includes some "Gravekeeper's" cards.
  ** The connection likely originates from the fact that Ishizu and Marik shared the archetype's theme of being [[Tomb Keeper]]s. Several "Gravekeeper's" monsters also resemble the Ishtar family.
