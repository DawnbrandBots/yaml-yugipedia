  "'''Hole'''" (ホール ''Hōru'') is an [[archetype]] of cards supported by the "[[Traptrix]]" archetype.

  In Japanese and other Asian languages, "[[Trap Hole (archetype)|Trap Hole]]" is not a sub-archetype of this one, as its name does not include 「ホール」. However, all cards that support the "Hole" archetype also support "Trap Hole" cards; for instance, the first effect of "[[Traptrix Myrmeleo]]" supports both 「ホール」and 「{{Ruby|落|お}}とし{{Ruby|穴|あな}} 」[[Normal Trap Card|Normal Trap cards]]. Since all of the support for the archetype only works on Normal Trap Cards, in the ''[[TCG]]'' support for both archetypes is simply listed as ''"Hole" Normal Trap'', with "Trap Hole" treated as a sub-archetype to shorten text and avoid redundancy.

  A number of unrelated cards, such as "[[Stronghold the Moving Fortress]]" and "[[Holding Arms]]", also fall into this archetype because they do have 「ホール」 in their Japanese names. "[[Goblin Pothole Squad]]" however is not for the opposite reason. Because ''TCG''/''OCG'' support for this archetype only works on [[Normal Trap Card]]s, none of those cases are an issue.
