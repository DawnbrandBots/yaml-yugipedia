  "'''Gusto'''", known as "'''Gusta'''" (ガスタ ''Gasuta'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is a ''[[Duel Terminal]]'' [[WIND]] [[archetype]] released in ''[[Duel Terminal - Raid of the Inverz!!]]''. It consists mainly of [[Psychic]]-Type humans and [[Winged Beast]]-Type animals, the latter including most of the Tuners. All [[Synchro Monster]]s and [[Xyz Monster]]s of the archetype are called "Daigusto", with the former consiting of a human-animal pair where the former rides an enlarged version of the latter (the Synchro's [[Level]] being accordingly equal to the sum of the two monsters').

  {{Main|Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines|Master Guide 4 card storylines#The Little Protector in the Great Marshland|The Valuable Book EX 2 card storylines#"Pilica" Enters the 'Star War' as a Member of the "Gusto" Tribe}}
  [[File:Crest-Gusto.svg|thumb|left|100px|The "Gusto" crest.]]
  The "Gusto" were a tribe that lived with the wind and worshipped the bountiful land they inhabited on since ancient times. Against their various outside enemies, they linked their hearts together with, and battled along, animals that lived around in order to protect their land through the generations. However, one day the "[[Steelswarm]]" started to take over the surface land. The "Gusto" united with the other clans to create a temporary union lead by the "[[Vylon]]". They obtained [[Daigusto Sphreez|new powers]] to fight back the "Steelswarm". Soon, the union finally defeated the invaders, but conflicts didn't cease; the "Vylon" decided to stop the wars between clans — by exterminating them completely. The "Gusto" [[Daigusto Phoenix|teamed up once again]] [[Evigishki Merrowgeist|with the other clans]] in order to halt the "Vylon".

  After stopping the "Vylon", the union between the tribes disbanded. At the time, the "Gusto" tribe was in danger of being attacked by the "[[Gishki]]", who had the goal to claim all the resources of the "[[Mist Valley]]" by themselves for their rituals. Fortunately, the "[[Gem-Knight]]s" foresaw this, and they [[Daigusto Emeral|lend their powers]] to protect the "Gusto". After the "Evi[[lswarm]]" appeared and threatened to destroy the world, the "Gusto" decided to join forces with the "Gem-Knights" and "[[Constellar]]s" to stop the "lswarm" for good.

  After the war against the "Evilswarm" and "[[Sophia, Goddess of Rebirth|Sophia]]" ended, the only survivor of this tribe were "[[Kamui, Hope of Gusto|Kamui]]" and "[[Reeze, Whirlwind of Gusto|Reeze]]". Shortly after, those two formed a family, and "[[Pilica, Descendant of Gusto|Pilica]]" was born. It is unknown what happened to "Reeze" at this point, but "[[Ritual Beast Tamer Elder|Kamui]]" eventually created a new tribe along with "Pilica": the "[[Ritual Beast]]s", which inherited the ability of communicating with nature (this time as [[Contact Fusion]]), joined by "[[Ritual Beast Tamer Lara|Lara]]" and "[[Ritual Beast Tamer Wen|Wen]]".

  Below are the connections that "Gusto" have, either within their own tribe or with outsiders:

  == Playing style ==
  The archetype's main strategy is almost entirely based on tightening their defense and loading the Graveyard, since most support for the "Gusto" archetype requires shuffling at least 2 or more "Gusto" monsters into the Deck. The Deck relies on heavy defensive tactics, beginning with its trio of searchers which form what is nicknamed the "recruiter loop": "[[Winda, Priestess of Gusto]]", "[[Gusto Gulldo]]", and "[[Gusto Egul]]". These three cards can continuously search one another out of the Deck when destroyed in battle while simultaneously filling the Graveyard with monsters, which can be utilized later with effects such as "[[Caam, Serenity of Gusto]]", "[[Pilica, Descendant of Gusto]]", and their Synchro Monsters as well.

  One of the main objectives of the Deck is "[[Daigusto Sphreez]]", as its damage-reflecting effect can burn through the opponent's LP by simply crashing the recruiter loop into their monsters.

  "Pilica, Descendant of Gusto" in particular helps with getting necessary Tuners in the Graveyard, making it as staple of the Deck (along with "[[Emergency Teleport]]") since it not only enables this Deck to Summon "Sphreez" faster without relying on interaction with the opponent, she also lets the player swarm the field faster when combined with revival cards.

  === Weaknesses ===
  The critical flaw of the "Gusto" Deck is the below-average ATK of many of its monsters, making them somewhat unsuitable for offensive purpose unless "Sphreez" is out. Since this Deck's strategy relies heavily on the Graveyard, any form of banishing can damage or cripple the entire Deck. "[[Transmigration Break]]" can effectively incapacitate it due to its need of recycling monsters. "[[Necrovalley]]" can shut down almost any major play, as only "[[Caam, Serenity of Gusto]]" and "[[Daigusto Gulldos]]" that can bypass its effect. "[[Archlord Kristya]]", "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]", "[[Summon Limit]]", "[[Poisonous Winds]]", and other anti-Summon cards can also shut down its defenses down, due to their heavy reliance on Special Summoning.

  Decks that excel at mass-disruption effects, such as "[[Inzektor]]", "[[Lightsworn]]", "[[Fire King]]", or "[[Burning Abyss]]", can severely cripple this Deck by simply bypassing its tricks with non-destruction removal instead. Since most of this Deck's major plays involve Extra Deck monsters, Decks like "[[Shaddoll]]" and "[[Nekroz]]" can punish it harshly, especially with "[[El Shaddoll Winda]]", "[[Nekroz of Unicore]]", and "[[Nekroz of Trishula]]".

  "[[Abyss Dweller]]" and "[[Soul Drain]]" also pose a threat by disabling any in-Graveyard effects, most notably of the searchers, while "[[Armades, Keeper of Boundaries]]", "[[Archfiend Black Skull Dragon]]", and "[[U.A. Mighty Slugger]]" prevent most of the recuriters' effects from activating at all.

  == Trivia ==
  * "Gusto" [[Synchro Monster]]s are similar to "[[Dragunity]]" Synchro Monsters in terms of theming and aesthetic, consisting of riders and their mounts ([[Winged Beast]] and [[Dragon]]s for "Dragunity" and [[Psychic]] and [[Winged Beast]]s for "Gusto", respectively).
  ** "[[Daigusto Sphreez]]" is the only exception, she does not have a mount as she received the power of the "Vylon" instead.
  ** This is probably a reference to the partnership between "[[Mist Valley]]" and "Dragunity" during the first generation of Duel Terminal world.
  * For non-Synchro "Gusto" Psychic monsters other than "Pilica", the Level appears to correlate with the character's age. Accordingly, the ''[[Duel Terminal Master Guide card storylines|Duel Terminal Master Guide]]'' establishes that the highest-Leveled "[[Windaar, Sage of Gusto]]" was the leader of the clan, while the lowest-Leveled "[[Kamui, Hope of Gusto]]" was born during the second war.
  ** According to ''[[Master Guide 4 card storylines#The Little Protector in the Great Marshland|Master Guide 4]]'', "Pilica" was born after the second war from "[[Reeze, Whirlwind of Gusto]]" and "Kamui", which may be why she doesn't conform to the pattern.
  * The "[[Ritual Beast]]" archetype is originated from "Gusto" archetype, as evidenced by its leader "[[Ritual Beast Tamer Elder]]" being elderly version of "Kamui", the "[[Ritual Beast Ulti]]" monsters having the same [[Ritual Beast Tamer|rider]]-[[Spiritual Beast|mount]] dynamic as the "Gusto" Synchro Monsters, and both being [[WIND]] themes with [[Psychic]]-Type humans and various-Type animals.
  * ''Duel Terminal Master Guide'' also claims that "[[Wynn the Wind Charmer]]" is a member of the "Gusto" tribe and the younger sister of "Winda", but left it.
  * If one looks closely (especialy at the Duel Terminal models), it is possible to notice that some human "Gusto" members (namely "Winda", "Windaar", "Reeze", and "Pilica") have the same cross-shaped pupils as the animal ones. The ''Duel Terminal Master Guide'' description of the families within the tribe suggests that this is a trait of the chief and warrior houses, as the ones that lack them ("Caam", "Musto", "Kamui", and "Pilica") are all from the priest house.<ref>{{Cite tweet |author=プルプッシュ(Yu-Gi-Oh)|user=pu11pu5h|number=1240217240546373632|date=March 18, 2020|title=端末世界の地上種族の一つであるガスタ。|language=JA|access-date=December 16, 2024}}</ref>
