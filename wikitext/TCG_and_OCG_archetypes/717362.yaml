  "'''Vaylantz'''", known as "'''Valiants'''" (ヴァリアンツ ''Variantsu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of mostly [[WATER]] [[Spellcaster]] and [[FIRE]] [[Machine]] (with one [[EARTH]] [[Fairy]]) [[Pendulum Monster]]s introduced in ''[[Deck-Build Pack: Tactical Masters]]''/''[[Tactical Masters]]''.

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 03: Vaylantz}}

  ==Etymology==
  The Japanese name for the "Vaylantz" archetype may come from "valiant," which means to show courage or determination. This is reflected in the archetype's tagline in promotional material. Its Japanese name may also be written as "variants", from the alternative way of playing games—especially board games—that differs from the standard, normal rules. This is reflected in how the playstyle of the archetype simulates the mechanics of a typical board game.

  The Japanese names of the members seem to have been derived from common family names. The most obvious cases are "Shinonome" and "Hojo," both of which are plain family names, while "Saion" (西園) is from "Saionji" (西園寺) and "Nazuki" (南月) from "Natsuki" (夏木). However, "Mamonaka" is rather uncommon.

  The Chinese name, "弈勇" (''Yìyǒng''), is a play on 义勇 (''Yìyǒng'' lit. "heroic", "valiant"), substituting one of its characters with the homophonous 弈 (''Yì'', lit. "''Go''", figuratively "chess").

  ==Design==
  The "Vaylantz" monsters are divided into two opposite groups:
  * The [[WATER]] [[Spellcaster]] monsters are based on human warriors from feudal Japan. Their kanji names contain characters corresponding to a cardinal direction. They are associated with the [[Field Spell Card]] "[[Vaylantz World - Shinra Bansho]]".
  * The [[FIRE]] [[Machine]] monsters, in contrast, are based on robots. Their names are based on aristocratic titles, such as "duke" and "baron", with an alliterative word as their title. They are associated with the Field Spell "[[Vaylantz World - Konig Wissen]]".
  The "Vaylantz" Spells and Traps revealed that the "Vaylantz" monsters are actually characters from a certain board game, complete with the depiction of the board and the chibi minifigures of the game itself.

  ==Playing style==
  "Vaylantz" is a [[Pendulum Monster|Pendulum]]-based [[Deck]] with a central focus on moving cards to their adjacent zones, including in the vertical direction. This central gameplay mechanic is likely intended to simulate the mechanics of a board game taking place in a two dimensional space. 
  The archetype's unique "vertical movement" effects involves moving cards from the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] to the [[Main Monster Zone]] and vice versa. These two movements are mechanically represented as follows:
  * "Forwards" (STZ → MMZ): [[Special Summon]] 1 [[Monster Card]] in a player's Spell & Trap Zone to their Main Monster Zone in its [[column]].
  * "Backwards" (MMZ → STZ): Place a player's monster [[face-up]] in their Spell & Trap Zone in that monster's column as a Continuous Spell (if a card is already in that zone, it [[destroy]]s it).
  The archetype has two central [[Field Spell]]s: "[[Vaylantz World - Shinra Bansho]]" and "[[Vaylantz World - Konig Wissen]]". When one is activated, the Field Spell mandatorily places the other face-up on the opponent's [[Field Spell Zone]]. Both of their effects can be used by the turn player: "Shinra Bansho" moves a Monster Card "forwards", while "Konig Wissen" moves an opponent's Monster Card "backwards".
  The archetype consists of two collective sets of monsters: the [[WATER]] [[Spellcaster]] ones and the [[FIRE]] [[Machine]] ones.
  All Main Deck "Vaylantz" monsters have a [[Pendulum Effect]] that lets them [[Special Summon]] themselves from the [[Pendulum Zone]] to the Main Monster Zone in that card's column (move "forwards"). However, each of these Pendulum Effects has conditions or restrictions, differing based on the [[Level]] of the monster:
  * Level 2 and 4: The player cannot Special Summon for the rest of the turn, except "Vaylantz" monsters and monsters from the [[Extra Deck]].
  * Level 6 and 8: The player must control a "Vaylantz" monster of their respective [[Attribute]] or have their corresponding Field Spell in a Field Zone, to activate the Pendulum Effect.
  Each "Vaylantz" monster has two [[monster effect]]s: a standard [[ignition]] effect that sometimes requires the card to be Special Summoned to be activated, and a [[trigger]] effect in response to the card being moved from a Monster Zone to another. The latter condition can be facilitated by some in-archetype cards and various external cards, such as "[[Senet Switch]]" and "[[Column Switch]]" (the former of which can be searched by "[[Vaylantz Wars - The Place of Beginning]]").
  The archetype's ability to easily [[swarm]] Pendulum Monsters means that it can be played as a combo Deck, focusing on Summoning [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]] and [[Link Monster|Link]] boss monsters. Alternatively, it can use "[[Arktos XII - Chronochasm Vaylantz]]" to disrupt the opponent's plays by activating the Main Deck monsters' move effects during their turn. Because all of the archetype's Main Deck monsters have the same [[Pendulum Scale]] of 1, its high-Scale [[Fusion Monster|Fusion Monsters]] or non-archetypal [[Pendulum Monster|Pendulum Monsters]] are needed to complete the scales to perform [[Pendulum Summon]]s. Its lack of a need for [[Normal Summon]]s also means that it can be hybridized with the "[[Invoked]]" archetype.
