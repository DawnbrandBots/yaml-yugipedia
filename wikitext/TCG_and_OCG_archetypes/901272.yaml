  "'''Heart'''" (ハート ''Hāto'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Extra Deck]] monsters with 3000 [[ATK]]. It is related to "[[Visas Starfrost]]" and the "[[Scareclaw]]", "[[Tearlaments]]", "[[Kashtira]]", and "[[Mannadium]]" archetypes.

  There are several older cards that are thematically unrelated, but that contain 「ハート」 in their Japanese names; this is not currently an issue due to support for the archetype being limited to Extra Deck monsters with specific ATK values. Notable among these are the "Heart-eartH" series of monsters used by [[Dr. Faker]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'', and the [[WATER]] [[Cyberse]] [[Link Monster]]s associated with the [[Ignis]] [[Aqua (character)|Aqua]] from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]''.

  == Design ==
  The "Heart" monsters are all upgraded forms of [[Level]] 4 [[Warrior]] monsters with 1500 [[ATK]] and 2100 [[DEF]]. Each one possesses a different [[Attribute]], based on the theme of the corresponding [[Broken World]] [[Field Spell]]. All pairs have different [[Type]]s from each other and, except for "[[Mannadium Prime-Heart]]", the other monsters in their respective archetypes.

  Design-wise, each "Heart" monster is a counterpart of "[[Visas Starfrost]]", representing one of his emotions.

  === Etymology ===
  The names of the "Heart" monsters' base forms feature the word for "realm" in different European languages, which is also included in their corresponding Broken World's name.

  The Simplified Chinese name of "Heart", 哈忒 (pinyin: hā tè), is a transcription of "Heart" that uses the character 忒 (pinyin: tè), which contains the Chinese character for "heart", 心 (pinyin: xīn) as a character component.

  == Members ==
  Each of the "Heart" monsters is based on an avatar of the Hindu god [[wikipedia:Vishnu|Vishnu]] (which is himself represented by "[[Visas Starfrost]]"). Vishnu's ''avatara'' are often numbered from 1 to 10: this is reflected in the Japanese name of each [[Broken World]] [[Field Spell]]. The "Heart" monsters are also based on the six basic emotions, an inspiration that is reflected in the color of their [[Attribute]] and the names of their archetypes.
