  '''Heart''' (ハート ''Hāto'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Extra Deck]] monsters with 3000 [[ATK]]. It is related to "[[Visas Starfrost]]" and the "[[Scareclaw]]", "[[Tearlaments]]", "[[Kashtira]]", and "[[Mannadium]]" archetypes.

  There are several older cards that are thematically unrelated, but that contain 「ハート」 in their Japanese names; this is not currently an issue due to support for the archetype being limited to Extra Deck monsters with specific ATK values. Notable among these are the "Heart-eartH" series of monsters, used by [[Dr. Faker]] from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'', and the "Heart" [[Link Monster|Link monsters]] associated with the [[Ignis]] from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]''.

  == Design ==
  The "Heart" monsters are all upgraded forms of [[Level]] 4 [[Warrior]] monsters with 1500 [[ATK]] and 2100 [[DEF]]. Each one possesses a different [[Attribute]], based on the theme of the corresponding [[Broken World]] [[Field Spell]]. All pairs have different [[Type]]s from each other and, except for "[[Mannadium Prime-Heart]]", the other monsters in their respective archetypes.

  Design-wise, each "Heart" monster is a counterpart of "[[Visas Starfrost]]", representing one of his emotions.

  === Etymology ===
  The names of the "Heart" monsters' base forms feature the word for "realm" in different European languages, which is also included in their corresponding Broken World's name.

  == Members ==
  Each of the "Heart" monsters is based on an avatar of the Hindu god [[wikipedia:Vishnu|Vishnu]] (which is itself represented by "[[Visas Starfrost]]"). Vishnu's ''avatara'' are often numbered from 1 to 10: this is reflected in the Japanese name of each [[Broken World]] [[Field Spell]]. The "Heart" monsters are also based on the six basic emotions, an inspiration that is reflected in the color of their [[Attribute]] and the names of their archetypes.
