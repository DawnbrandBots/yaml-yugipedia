  "'''Bystial'''", known as "'''Byssted'''" (ビーステッド ''Bīsuteddo'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] monsters which first debuted in ''[[Darkwing Blast]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 01: The Decisive Battle of the Northern Land|Story of White card storylines}}

  == Etymology ==
  "Bystial" is a portmanteau of "abyss" and "bestial".

  The Japanese name "Byssted" is a portmanteau of "abyss" and "beast". "Byssted" also uses the kanji 「深淵の獣」, literally meaning "abyss beast". The Japanese names of the [[Special Summon Monster]]s use the same kanji, but they instead read as "The Byssted" (in reference to [[wikipedia:The Beast (Revelation)|the Beast of Revelation]]).

  The [[Level]] 6 "Bystial" Effect Monsters are named after the first kings of Britain according to [[wikipedia:Annio da Viterbo|Annio da Viterbo's]] ''Berossus'' (Viterbo's work was later revealed to be a fabrication and became known as the ''Pseudo-Berossus''). One of the kings in Viterbo's list is the mythological [[wikipedia:Alebion|Albion]], who is said to be the son of [[wikipedia:Poseidon|Poseidon]] and supposedly the namesake of the island of [[wikipedia:Albion|Albion]] (the archaic name of [[wikipedia:Great Britain|Great Britain]]).

  == Design ==
  === Members ===
  ==== Effect Monsters ====
  The "Bystial" monsters that can be [[Normal Summon]]ed are all [[Level]] 6 [[DARK]] [[Dragon]] monsters with 2500 [[ATK]] and 2000 [[DEF]].

  == Playing style ==
  "Bystial" is a [[Dragon]] theme centered on banishing resources and general disruption of the opponent's plays. All [[Level]] 6 members of the theme have effects if [[Special Summon]]ed or sent to the [[Graveyard|GY]], and additionally share the following effect:

  {{Quote|''"You can [[target]] 1 [[LIGHT]] or [[DARK]] [[Monster Card|monster]] in either GY; [[banish]] it, and if you do, Special Summon this card from your [[hand]]. This is a [[Quick Effect]] if your opponent [[control]]s a monster."''}}

  This effect is the crux of the archetype's ability to disrupt the opponent's plays that rely on particular DARK or LIGHT monsters remaining in their Graveyard, serving as [[hand trap]]s. Among the Level 6 members, "[[Bystial Magnamhut]]" is the most useful since it can add any Dragon monster from the user's Deck or GY to their hand, including other "Bystial" monsters. "[[Bystial Druiswurm]]" can send an opponent's Special Summoned monster to the GY if "Druiswurm" is sent to the GY, while "[[Bystial Baldrake]]" can Tribute one other LIGHT or DARK monster the user controls to banish a [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]], [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]], [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]], [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]], or [[Link Monster]] the opponent just Special Summoned, making the duo serve as effective removal options. Finally, "[[Bystial Saronir]]" can send other "Bystial" monsters or "[[Branded]]" [[Spell Card|Spells]]/[[Trap Card|Traps]] to the GY if it is sent to the GY.

  Typically in a "Bystial"-focused Deck, the Level 6 "Bystial" monsters also serve as tributes for the higher Level members of the theme, "[[The Bystial Lubellion]]" and "[[The Bystial Alba Los]]". "Lubellion" is a Level 8 monster that can be Special Summoned from hand or GY by tributing 1 Level 6 or higher DARK Dragon monster with effects to not only send itself from hand to GY to search a Level 6 or lower "Bystial" monster but also to place "[[Branded]]" [[Continuous Spell Card|Continuous Spell]]/[[Continuous Trap Card|Trap]] cards from the Deck face-up in the user's [[Spell & Trap Zone]]. "Alba Los" is the highest leveled monster and requires tributing 2 "Bystial" monsters to Special Summon itself. This card can negate the effects of any face-up [[Ritual Monster|Ritual]], [[Fusion Monster|Fusion]], [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]], [[Xyz Monster|Xyz]], or [[Link Monster|Link]] monster on the field with the additional effect to banish all cards from each player's [[Extra Deck]] face-up if it leaves the field by a card effect. "[[Bystial Dis Pater]]" is a powerful Synchro Monster that can Special Summon any LIGHT or DARK monster that is banished, or it can shuffle any banished card to the Deck in response to an opponent if they activate a monster effect, either negating that effect or destroying that monster.

  "Bystial" monsters generally support "Branded" cards and vice-versa, mainly with the latter archetype's Continuous Spells/Traps. The two most useful "Branded" cards are "[[Branded Regained]]" and "[[Branded Beast]]". "Regained" allows the player to recur card advantage, gaining a draw by recovering a LIGHT or DARK monster that was just banished whilst also being able to revive "Bystial" monsters whenever the opponent [[Normal Summon|Normal]] or Special Summons a monster(s). Meanwhile "Beast" can destroy an opponent's card they control by tributing a Dragon monster while the player controls a "Bystial" monster, making it pair well with "Druiswurm" for removing cards on the opponent's field and can recover other "Branded" Continuous Spells/Traps from the GY (typically those sent to the GY with "Bystial Saronir"). Other "Branded" cards include "[[Branded Befallen]]", which can protect the user's "Bystial" monsters from the opponent's interactions by banishing a LIGHT or DARK monster, and "[[Etude of the Branded]]", which allows the user to [[Synchro Summon]] during their opponent's turn and also banishes any monster sent to the opponent's GY if the opponent would use monsters as material for a Fusion, Synchro or Link Summon, or Tributes for a [[Ritual Summon]] while the user controls a "Bystial" monster.

  "Bystial" monsters and their supported "Branded" Spell/Traps fair very well in any deck using LIGHT and/or DARK monsters, especially modern [[Chaos (series)|Chaos]] [[Chaos Dragon|Dragon]] decks. In particular, they synergize most effectively with the "Branded-[[Despia]]" playstyle (the "[[Despia]]" archetype, "[[Fallen of Albaz]]" alongside with their specific supporting cards) due to the large number of cards in the "Branded" archetype as a whole; many of them support the playstyles of both themes. Outside of these deck themes, the Level 6 "Bystial" monsters (mainly "Magnamhut", "Druiswurm" and "Baldrake") are also included in other Decks as staples for their hand trap utility, their ease of Summoning themselves for Extra Deck plays, and "Magnamhut" is a useful addition for any Dragon deck. The strong versalities of the "Bystial" cards have resulted in some "Bystial" cards being currently or formerly Limited (in particular. "Magnamhut" is Limited in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game|OCG]]'', ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|TCG]]'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel|Master Duel]]'' formats).

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Whether being used as an engine or as handtraps, the main "Bystial" monsters are effectively useless in your hand if there are no [[LIGHT]] and/or [[DARK]] monsters in either Graveyard. The utility of "Bystial" monsters is therefore significantly reduced if the opponent is not playing a Deck of monsters with either Attribute.
  * The main shared effect of the "Bystial" monsters require the user to banish the targeted card in the GY to be Summoned successfully. As such, the Summon can be prevented by pre-emptively removing that targeted monster from the GY (such as banishing them via your own card effects), causing the summoning effect to resolve with no effect.
  *Anti-banishing floodgates such as "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" renders the shared "Bystial" monster effect useless. While "[[Artifact Lancea]]" works similarly, its effect is only temporary for a turn, and it being a LIGHT monster means that it is susceptible to being banished by the "Bystial" monster afterwards.

  == Trivia ==
  * Out of the four Level '''6''' members of the archetype, only '''three''' were first released together with "The Bystial Lubellion". Considering how the latter is based on [[wikipedia:Lucifer|Lucifer]] (a.k.a. Satan, the Devil of the Christian theology), this was likely a reference to the [[wikipedia:Number of the beast|number of the beast]] ('''666'''), which is often associated with Satan itself.
