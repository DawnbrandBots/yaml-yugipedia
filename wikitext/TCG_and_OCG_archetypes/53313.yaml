  "'''Clear'''" (クリアー ''Kuriā'') is a theme of [[DARK]] monsters that were introduced in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' that were used by [[Yusuke Fujiwara]] under the possession of [[Nightshroud]]. They are an [[archetype]] in the anime, but a [[series]] defined by [[Mentions|mentioning]] "[[Clear World]]" in the ''[[TCG]]''/''[[OCG]]''.

  ==History==
  The "Clear" monsters first appeared in season 3 of ''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX''. There, they treated themselves as not having an [[Attribute]] while they are [[face-up]] on the [[Playing Field|field]], which prevents "[[Clear World]]" from impacting the controller negatively. They were featured in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Tag Force]]'' games as "Game Original cards" starting with ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 3]]'', retaining the no-Attribute effect.

  "Clear World" and "[[Clear Vice Dragon]]" were released in Japan with ''[[Limited Edition 15]]'' and in the ''TCG'' in ''[[Stardust Overdrive]]'', making them the only members of the theme for a long time. The remaining cards were introduced in ''[[Animation Chronicle 2024]]'', which introduced mentioning "Clear World" as the defining trait of the series.

  == Playing style ==
  {{Stub}}
  The "Clear" theme is a stun Deck centered around their [[Field Spell Card]] "[[Clear World]]", which inflicts both players a variety of negative effects while controlling monsters of a specific Attribute(s), but the monsters share a [[monster effect]] that completely shields their controller from them. However, contrary to the anime and ''Tag Force'' implementations, they are still [[DARK]] monsters even while on the filed, so they can be vulnerable to other anti-Attribute and anti-DARK cards.
