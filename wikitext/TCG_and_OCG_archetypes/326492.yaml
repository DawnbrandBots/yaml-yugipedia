  "'''Ritual Beast'''", known as "'''Spirit Beast'''" ({{Ruby|霊|れい}}{{Ruby|獣|じゅう}} ''Reijū'') in the ''[[OCG]]'' and "'''Spiritual Beast'''" in other ''[[TCG]]'' languages, is an [[archetype]] of [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Booster SP: Tribe Force]]''. The emphasis of their strategy is [[Contact Fusion]] by banishing the [[Fusion Material]]s you control. This archetype includes the sub-archetypes "[[Ritual Beast Tamer]]", comprised by humanoid [[Psychic]] monsters, "[[Spiritual Beast]]", whose members are [[Beast]], [[Pyro]], [[Aqua]] and [[Thunder]] beast-like creatures, and "[[Ritual Beast Ulti]]", which are the [[Fusion Monster]]s of the archetype as a whole. All members of this archetype are [[WIND]] monsters, except for the [[LIGHT]] "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Gaiapelio]]", "[[Spiritual Beast Tamer Lara]]", and "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Nochiudrago]]".
  ==Lore==
  {{Main|Master Guide 5 card storylines}}
  <blockquote>''The Spiritual Beast have dwelt on this world since time immemorial and possess mystical powers. They live together with the Ritual Beast Tamers, and together both man and beast [[Ritual Beast Ulti|combine their powers]] together to try and prevent any disaster that comes their way.''<ref>[http://www.ygorganization.com/weaselstamersmagicarmorandinfernorobotsohmy/ The Organization] - New Duel Terminal World Lores</ref></blockquote>
  ==Etymology==
  In French, Italian and Portuguese, the archetype is called "Spiritual Beast", since the implied "Ritual/Spiritual" pun wouldn't work in those languages due to the backward word orders. For example, in French, if "Ritual Beast" were to translate to "Bête Rituelle" and "Spiritual Beast" to "Bête Spirituelle" instead, the "Spiritual Beast" archetype would then be split from "Ritual Beast", or the whole [[card text]] wording would be unnecessarily complicated. As for German, the word "Geist" ("ghost; spirit") appears to be the most common but it seems too short and not to be able to bear such a pun.
  ==Design==
  This archetype seems to be the remnants/successor of the "[[Gusto]]" archetype in the ''[[Duel Terminal]]'' storyline, as "[[Ritual Beast Tamer Elder]]" is a grown-up "[[Kamui, Hope of Gusto]]". Their team symbol is a sphere encircled by four-pointed star (different style for each pair), which shaped similarly as the crest of the "[[Gusto]]", further reinforcing the connection between them. In addition, the artwork of the cards features the coiled foliage seen in many "[[Naturia]]" cards, implying that these monsters may inhabit the "[[Naturia Forest]]". This connection is cemented by the art of "Ulti-Gaiapelio", which depicts "[[Naturia Gaiastrio]]" as part of a "Ritual Beast" pair. The Fusion monsters of the archetype also serve as a throwback to the original "[[Gem-Knight]]" Fusion Monsters, forming the same Pyro - Aqua - Thunder trinity (albeit in WIND as opposed to [[EARTH]] and with the exception of "Ulti-Gaiapelio", which is [[LIGHT]]/[[Psychic]]).

  ==Playing style==
  Each of the "Ritual Beast Tamer" monsters have effects that helps swarming the Field (with the exception of "[[Ritual Beast Tamer Zefrawendi]]") in order to initiate Contact Fusion, either by Special Summoning "Ritual Beast" monsters from Deck, GY or banished ones, or even grants an extra Normal Summon.
  On the other hand, the "Spiritual Beast" monsters banish 1 "Ritual Beast" card from the hand, Deck, GY, or Extra Deck in order to get rid of problematic opposing cards, search for a card on the long run, give power boosts, or setting up combos, respectively.
  Each of the Main Deck monsters also shares a restriction that only allows them to be Special Summoned once per turn. 
  The original "Ritual Beast Ulti" Fusion Monsters are all Level 6 and their ATK and DEF have a sum of 3000. Each of them has their own unique roles: 
  * "'''[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Apelio]]'''" is their offensive vanguard, with 2600 ATK and immunity against any card effects while it attacks.
  * "'''[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Pettlephin]]'''" is their defensive wall, with solid 2800 DEF and being indestructible by card effects.
  * "'''[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Cannahawk]]'''" is the supportive pillar of the deck (and the most important one). Despite its average ATK and DEF, it can search any "Ritual Beast" card from your Deck to help accumulates resources.
  All of them share the following effect: 
  ''"During either player's turn: You can return this card you control to the Extra Deck, then target 2 of your banished monsters (1 "Ritual Beast Tamer" monster and 1 "Spiritual Beast" monster); Special Summon them in Defense Position."''
  It is one of their biggest strength, allowing them to dodge most dangerous card effects. This ability also allows the player to utilize the loophole of "Once per turn" effects, allowing the player use them multiple times per turn (mostly "Spiritual Beast" monsters and "Ritual Beast Ulti-Cannahawk"), effectively accumulating numerous resources, initiating offense, and often, leads into [[OTK]] in just a few turns.
  "'''[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Gaiapelio]]'''" is their boss monster; with 3200 ATK and powerful negation effect (only if Summoned properly), it is best Summoned when aiming for a decisive victory that same turn.
  The archetype also has a pair of Pendulum Monsters, "[[Ritual Beast Tamer Zeframpilica]]" and "[[Ritual Beast Tamer Zefrawendi]]", with [[Pendulum Scale]] of 1 and 7 respectively, allowing the Deck to [[Pendulum Summon]] (albeit not always necessary). They also have their own Link Monster, "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Kimunfalcos]]", which helps extending the combo further with more Normal Summons and provide power boosts for offensive purpose.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]", "[[Chaos Hunter]]" and "[[Artifact Lancea]]" prevents cards from being [[banish]]ed, preventing their Contact Fusion and most of their effects.
  * As all of their effects activates on the field, "[[Skill Drain]]" and "[[Lose 1 Turn]]" can be a nuisance for this deck. It won't stop them from conducting Contact Fusion or de-fusing, but does shut down the search effect of "Ulti-Cannahawk" (without its [[Card Tips:Ritual Beast Ulti-Cannahawk|de-fuse trick]]), or most of its Main Deck monsters.
  ** However, this can also benefit "Ulti-Apelio" in some way, since without its immunity effect, it can gain ATK boosts from "Spiritual Beast Apelio", allowing it to destroy bigger monster in battle.
  * Due to their "de-fusing" [[Quick Effect]]s, most targeting effects are particularly ineffective against them. But it still won't save them from cards like "[[Artifact Moralltach]]", "[[Madolche Queen Tiaramisu]]", "[[Nekroz of Trishula]]" or even the opposing "[[Ritual Beast Steeds]]". Effect negation or destruction negation effect are particularly important against those threats.
  * "[[Denko Sekka]]", "[[Royal Decree]]", or "[[Trap Stun]]" can shut down both "Ritual Beast Steeds" and "[[Ritual Beast Ambush]]", which most Ritual Beast decks depends on to secure field presences. "Denko Sekka" is the most dangerous of them all, since its [[Continuous Effect]] doesn't leave any chance for player to respond with on-field cards at all; but can still be stopped by either hand traps like "[[Effect Veiler]]", or Counter Traps like "[[Solemn Warning]]" or "[[Chaos Trap Hole]]".
  * [[Counter Trap Card]]s that can negate Special Summons can effectively disrupt the deck's major play, since not even the de-fuse abilities of "Ritual Beast Ulti" monsters can dodge it. Negating the Summon of "Ulti-Cannahawk", in particular, can almost completely paralyze the deck.
  * [[Kaiju]] monsters can eliminate their Fusion Monster immediately, without them having a chance to respond.
  ==Trivia==
  * This archetype's [[Contact Fusion]] style is similar to that of [[A-to-Z]] monsters, albeit with the ability to freely reverse the fusions, and less-specific requirements.
  ** Their Fusion Monsters, with the way they're Summoned and their similar "tagging out" ability, is also similar to that of [[Gladiator Beast]] Fusion Monsters.
  * All monsters in this archetype have their formal names derived (in whole or in part) from [[wikipedia:Ainu_language|Ainu]], the only remaining (though nearly extinct itself) language of the [[wikipedia:Ainu people|ethnic group of the same name]]. This language was also featured on members of the "[[Gusto]]" archetype – most notably "[[Kamui, Hope of Gusto]]", whose name comes from the Ainu word for "deity".  <ref>[http://www.ygorganization.com/kiminitodokenorthernlights/ The Organization] - Names and Etymology EP2: Ainu, Language of the Spirits</ref>
