  "'''Ritual Beast'''", known as "'''Spirit(ual) Beast'''" ({{Ruby|霊|れい}}{{Ruby|獣|じゅう}} ''Reijū'') in all other languages, is an [[archetype]] of [[WIND]] and [[LIGHT]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Booster SP: Tribe Force]]''. It focuses on [[Contact Fusion]] and is made up of three sub-archetypes: "[[Ritual Beast Tamer]]" (humanoid [[Psychic]] monsters), "[[Spiritual Beast]]" (animal creatures of various [[Type]]s), and "[[Ritual Beast Ulti]]" ([[Fusion Monster]]s represented by a Tamer riding a Beast).

  <blockquote>''The Spiritual Beasts have dwelt in this world since time immemorial and possess mystical powers. They live together with the Ritual Beast Tamers, and together both man and beast combine their powers together to try and prevent any disaster that comes their way.''<ref>[http://www.ygorganization.com/weaselstamersmagicarmorandinfernorobotsohmy/ The Organization] - New Duel Terminal World Lores</ref></blockquote>

  ==Etymology==
  In other ''TCG'' languages, the archetype is called "Spirit(ual) Beast", mainly as the pun in the English name is unuseable due to the inverse word order in Romance languages. For example, if "Ritual Beast" were to be translated in French to "Bête Rituelle", the "Spiritual Beast" archetype ("Bête '''Spi'''rituelle") would have to always be listed separately in overall "Ritual Beast" support, making [[card text]] unnecessarily complicated. As for German, it may be because the word "Geist" (the most common translation of "spirit") does not have any similarly-convenient pun.

  All members of this group, except "Winda", derive their given names from [[wikipedia:Ainu language|Ainu]], the language of the Hokkaido [[wikipedia:Ainu people|native ethnic group of the same name]].

  ==Design==
  This archetype is part of the ''[[Duel Terminal]]'' storyline, forming the remnants/successors of the "[[Gusto]]" archetype, most apparent with "[[Ritual Beast Tamer Elder]]" being an old "[[Kamui, Hope of Gusto]]". Its symbol is a sphere encircled by four-pointed star (in a different style for each beast-tamer pair), shaped similarly as the four-armed spiral crest of the "[[Gusto]]", further reinforcing the connection between them. In addition, the artwork of the cards features the coiled foliage seen in many "[[Naturia]]" cards, implying that these monsters specifically inhabit the "[[Naturia Forest]]". This connection is furthered by "Ulti-Gaiapelio", which is "Ulti-Apelio" fused with "[[Naturia Gaiastrio]]". Aside to the obvious continuation of the "Gusto" Synchro Monsters, the original three "Ritual Beast" Fusion Monsters also serve as a throwback to the original "[[Gem-Knight]]" Fusions, forming the same Pyro-Aqua-Thunder Type trio.

  ==Playing style==
  "Ritual Beast" focuses on repeated Contact Fusions by banishing from field, then "tag out" (returning back to the Extra Deck) the Fusions to Summon back banished monsters. This allows the Deck to constantly re-use their monsters' [[once per turn]] [[effect]]s - the most important being "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Cannahawk]]" - to accumulate [[advantage]]. However, each Main Deck "Ritual Beast" monster can only be Special Summoned once per turn, limiting how many plays can be made per turn.

  Each of the "Ritual Beast Tamer" monsters have effects that help swarm the field (other than "[[Ritual Beast Tamer Zefrawendi|Zefrawendi]]"), while the "Spiritual Beast" monsters either banish a "Ritual Beast" card or send one from the Deck to the Graveyard.

  Most "Ritual Beast Ulti" Fusion Monsters require a "Ritual Beast Tamer" and a "Spiritual Beast" as material, and can tag out into 2 monsters (1 of each). Since the latter is a [[Quick Effect]], it can be used to dodge [[target]]ing effects.
  * "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Cannahawk|Cannahawk]]" searches a "Ritual Beast" by returning 2 banished cards to the Graveyard. For this card tag-out effect has additional value in that can be [[Chain]]ed to the search to prevent the opponent from using activated [[negate|negations]].
  * "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Gaiapelio|Gaiapelio]]" is the Deck's in-house boss monster, acting as an omni-negate that can be used so long as there are "Ritual Beast" cards in hand to banish. As a trade-off, unlike the other Contact Fusions, it additionally demands another "Ritual Beast Ulti" monster as material and cannot tag out.
  * "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Nochiudrago|Nochiudrago]]" can also banish its materials from the Graveyard, taking advantage of monsters sent there by e.g. [[Link Summon]]ing, but in exchange it can only tag out into 1 monster, though it can be of any of the sub-archetypes. It protects other "Ritual Beast" monsters from targeting effects.

  The Deck also has two [[Link Monster]]s, "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Kimunfalcos]]" (which allows an additional Normal Summon) and "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Reirautari]]" (allowing another Normal Summon and acting as disruption), and two [[Pendulum Monster]]s (both part of the "[[Zefra]]" archetype), though the latter are superfluous to its strategy.

  Modern "Ritual Beast" Decks often make use of "[[Infernal Flame Banshee]]" to search "[[Nemeses Flag]]", which in turn can search "[[Archnemeses Protos]]" or "[[Nemeses Corridor]]" (used to Summon "[[Thunder Dragon Colossus]]") to floodgate the opponent. They can also run "[[Dimension Shifter]]" with little or no downside.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]", "[[Chaos Hunter]]", and "[[Artifact Lancea]]" prevents cards from being [[banish]]ed, preventing the Fusions from being Summon and using most of their effects.
  * As it almost entirely lacks out-of-field effects, "[[Skill Drain]]" and "[[Lose 1 Turn]]" can be a nuisance for this Deck. They won't stop them from conducting Contact Fusion or tagging out (allowing "Ulti-Cannihawk" to activate its effects freely), but it does shut down most of its Main Deck and Link Monsters.
  * Non-targeting removal such as "[[Artifact Moralltach]]", "[[Madolche Queen Tiaramisu]]", "[[Nekroz of Trishula]]" or even an opposing "[[Ritual Beast Steeds]]" can bypass the tagging-out and the targeting protection from "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Nochiudrago]]".
  * [[Counter Trap Card]]s that can negate Special Summons can effectively disrupt the Deck's major plays, since the de-fusing effect cannot be used before the monster is succesfully Summoned. Negating the Summon of "Ulti-Cannahawk", in particular, can almost completely paralyze the Deck.

  ==Trivia==
  * This archetype's style of [[Contact Fusion]] and "tagging out" is similar that of the "[[Gladiator Beast]]s".
