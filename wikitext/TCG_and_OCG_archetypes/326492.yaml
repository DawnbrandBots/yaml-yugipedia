  "'''Ritual Beast'''", known as "'''Spirit Beast'''" ({{Ruby|霊|れい}}{{Ruby|獣|じゅう}} ''Reijū'') or "'''Spiritual Beast'''" in all other languages, is an [[archetype]] of [[Monster Card|monsters]] that debuted in ''[[Booster SP: Tribe Force]]''. The emphasis of their strategy is [[Contact Fusion]] by banishing the [[Fusion Material]]s you control. This archetype includes the sub-archetypes "[[Ritual Beast Tamer]]", comprised by humanoid [[Psychic]] monsters, "[[Spiritual Beast]]", whose members are [[Beast]], [[Pyro]], [[Aqua]] and [[Thunder]] beast-like creatures, and "[[Ritual Beast Ulti]]", which are the [[Fusion Monster]]s of the archetype as a whole. All members of this archetype are [[WIND]] monsters, except for the [[LIGHT]] "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Gaiapelio]]", "[[Spiritual Beast Tamer Lara]]", and "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Nochiudrago]]".

  ==Lore==
  {{Main|Master Guide 5 card storylines|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#No. 11: "Duel Terminal" World Side Story - Secret Maneuvers in Purgatory}}
  <blockquote>''The Spiritual Beast have dwelt on this world since time immemorial and possess mystical powers. They live together with the Ritual Beast Tamers, and together both man and beast [[Ritual Beast Ulti|combine their powers]] together to try and prevent any disaster that comes their way.''<ref>[http://www.ygorganization.com/weaselstamersmagicarmorandinfernorobotsohmy/ The Organization] - New Duel Terminal World Lores</ref></blockquote>

  ==Etymology==
  In other ''TCG'' languages, the archetype is called "Spirit(ual) Beast", mainly as the pun of the English name is unuseable due to the inverse word order in Romance languages. For example, if "Ritual Beast" were to be translated in French to "Bête Rituelle", the "Spiritual Beast" archetype ("Bête '''Spi'''rituelle") would have to always be listed separately in overall "Ritual Beast" support, making [[card text]] unnecessarily complicated. As for German, it may be because the word "Geist" (the most common translation of "spirit") does not have any similarly-convenient pun.

  ==Design==
  This archetype is part of the ''[[Duel Terminal]]'' storyline, forming the remnants/successor of the "[[Gusto]]" archetype, most apparent with "[[Ritual Beast Tamer Elder]]" being a grown-up "[[Kamui, Hope of Gusto]]". Their symbol is a sphere encircled by four-pointed star (in a different style for each beast-tamer pair), shaped similarly as the "four-armed spiral" crest of the "[[Gusto]]", further reinforcing the connection between them. In addition, the artwork of the cards features the coiled foliage seen in many "[[Naturia]]" cards, implying that these monsters specifically inhabit the "[[Naturia Forest]]". This connection is further by "Ulti-Gaiapelio", which is "Ulti-Apelio" fused with "[[Naturia Gaiastrio]]". The Fusion Monsters of the archetype also serve as a throwback to the original "[[Gem-Knight]]" Fusions, forming the same Pyro-Aqua-Thunder trio (albeit with WIND replacing [[EARTH]] and with the exception of "Ulti-Gaiapelio", which is a [[LIGHT]] [[Psychic]]).

  ==Playing style==
  "Ritual Beast" focuses on repeated Contact Fusion by banishing from field, then "tagging out" the Fusions to Summon back banished monsters. This allows the Deck to constantly re-use their monsters' soft [[once per turn]] effects - the most important being "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Cannahawk]]" - to accumulate [[advantage]]. However, each Main Deck "Ritual Beast" monster can only be Special Summoned once per turn, limiting how many plays can be made per turn.

  Each of the "Ritual Beast Tamer" monsters have effects that help swarm the field (with the exception of "[[Ritual Beast Tamer Zefrawendi]]"), while the "Spiritual Beast" monsters either banish a "Ritual Beast" card from a location or send a "Ritual Beast" card from Deck to GY.

  "Ritual Beast Ulti" monsters can be Contact Fused by banishing monsters from field. Each one, except for "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Gaiapelio|Ulti-Gaipelio]]", requires a "Ritual Beast Tamer" and a "Spiritual Beast".
  * "'''[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Cannahawk]]'''" searches out a "Ritual Beast" by returning 2 banished cards to the GY, and tags itself out to summon back valid Fusion materials from the banished zone. Since the latter effect is a Quick Effect, it can be used to dodge targeting effects, and both of "Ulti-Cannahawk's" effects can be activated in the same [[Chain]].
  * "'''[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Gaiapelio]]'''" is the Deck's in-house boss monster, acting as an omni-negate that can be used so long as there are "Ritual Beast" cards in hand to banish. It can be fused with a "Ritual Beast Ulti" with a "Tamer" and "Spiritual Beast", and unlike the other Contact Fusions, it cannot tag out.
  * "'''[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Nochiudrago]]'''" can be Contact Fused by banishing from field or Graveyard, taking advantage of monsters sent to the GY for any reason (e.g., [[Link Summon]]ing). It also protects other "Ritual Beast" monsters from targeting effects, and can tag itself out to Summon any 1 banished "Ritual Beast" monster.

  The Deck also has two [[Link Monster]]s, "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Kimunfalcos]]" (which allows an additional Normal Summon) and "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Reirautari]]" (allowing another Normal Summon and acting as disruption). It additionally has two [[Pendulum Monster]]s, both part of the "[[Zefra]]" archetype, but the Pendulum mechanic is not important to modern "Ritual Beast" strategies.

  Modern "Ritual Beast" Decks often make use of "[[Infernal Flame Banshee]]" to search "[[Nemeses Flag]]", which can search "[[Archnemeses Protos]]" or "[[Nemeses Corridor]]" (used to summon "[[Thunder Dragon Colossus]]") to floodgate the opponent. They can also run "[[Dimension Shifter]]" with little or no downside.

  ===Weaknesses===
  * "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]", "[[Chaos Hunter]]" and "[[Artifact Lancea]]" prevents cards from being [[banish]]ed, preventing their Contact Fusion and most of their effects.
  * As all of their effects activate on the field, "[[Skill Drain]]" and "[[Lose 1 Turn]]" can be a nuisance for this deck. It won't stop them from conducting Contact Fusion or de-fusing (allowing "Ulti-Cannihawk" to activate its effects freely), but it does shut down most of its Main Deck and Link monsters.
  * Due to their Contact Fusions' "de-fusing" [[Quick Effects]], and "[[Ritual Beast Ulti-Nochiudrago]]'s" targeting protection, most targeting effects are less effective. Conversely, non-targeting removal, such as "[[Artifact Moralltach]]", "[[Madolche Queen Tiaramisu]]", "[[Nekroz of Trishula]]" or even an opposing "[[Ritual Beast Steeds]]" can help bypass this.
  * [[Counter Trap]]s that can negate Special Summons can effectively disrupt the Deck's major play, since not even the de-fuse abilities of "Ritual Beast Ulti" monsters can dodge it. Negating the Summon of "Ulti-Cannahawk", in particular, can almost completely paralyze the deck.

  ==Trivia==
  * This archetype's [[Contact Fusion]] style is similar to that of [[A-to-Z]] monsters, albeit with the ability to freely reverse the fusions, and less specific requirements.
  ** Their Fusion Monsters, with the way they are Summoned and their similar "tagging out" ability, is also similar to that of [[Gladiator Beast]] Fusion Monsters.
  * All monsters in this archetype have their formal names derived (in whole or in part) from [[wikipedia:Ainu_language|Ainu]], the only remaining (though nearly extinct itself) language of the [[wikipedia:Ainu people|ethnic group of the same name]]. This language was also featured on members of the "[[Gusto]]" archetype – most notably "[[Kamui, Hope of Gusto]]", whose name comes from the Ainu word for "deity".  <ref>[http://www.ygorganization.com/kiminitodokenorthernlights/ The Organization] - Names and Etymology EP2: Ainu, Language of the Spirits</ref>
