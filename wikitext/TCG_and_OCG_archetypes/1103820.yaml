  "'''Mitsurugi'''" ({{Ruby|巳剣|ミツルギ}} ''Mitsurugi'', lit. "'''Serpent Sword'''") is a [[TCG-only|World Premiere]] [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] [[Reptile]] monsters introduced in ''[[Supreme Darkness]]''.

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  The name "Mitsurugi" originates from the Japanese word for sword, ''[[wikipedia:Tsurugi (sword)|tsurugi]]''. Each member is named after a legendary Japanese sword, specifically the swords used by [[Wikipedia:Susanoo-no-Mikoto|Susano-o]] and [[Wikipedia:Takemikazuchi|Takemikazuchi]]. The [[Level 4]] [[Effect Monster]]s are appended with the phrase "no Mikoto" after the archetype name, an honorific commonly used to refer to gods.

  ===Members===
  The "Mitsurugi" monsters are generally split into two groups: The "Mitsurugi no Mikoto" Level 4 Effect Monsters, and the "no Mitsurugi" [[Level 8]] [[Ritual Monster]]s. A Level 4 Effect Monster and the corresponding Level 8 Ritual Monster form a pair, with the Ritual Monster having one of the names of its respective sword and its Effect Monster counterpart having its alternate name.

  The theme's association with [[Reptile]]s appears to be referencing Susano-o's best known feat of slaying the eight-headed serpent [[wikipedia:Yamata no Orochi|Yamata no Orochi]], with "Ame no Murakumo" being directly based on Orochi due to the sword was found on Orochi's tail by Susanoo after he slain the monster.

  ==Playing style==

  The "Mitsurugi" archetype is a Ritual archetype that revolves around its main Level 8 Ritual Monsters. Each monster in the archetype has an effect that activates in the Graveyard when they are Tributed, recovering card advantage and board presence when they are used as material for Ritual Summons or when they are Tributed by their own effects. The goal of the archetype is to end on "[[Ame no Murakumo no Mitsurugi]]" and "[[Futsu no Mitama no Mitsurugi]]", who together make the archetype difficult to break through due to their search and recursion on Tribute as well as their disruptive effects on the field; "Ame no Murakumo" can destroy all monsters the opponent controls when Special Summoned and can either negate an opponent's card or force them to discard, while "Futsu" can swarm the board with Reptiles as the opponent Special Summons their monsters, recurring "Kusanagi" and "Saji" to protect the field. To enable easier Ritual Summoning, their Ritual Spell Card, "[[Mitsurugi Ritual]]", can both Ritual Summon from the Deck by using materials in the hand/field and Ritual Summon from the hand by using materials in the Deck, both each once per turn, increasing the consistency with which the archetype is capable of accessing its Ritual Monsters.

  The theme has great synergy with "[[Ogdoadic]]", whose main mechanic consists on Tributing monsters from the field to Special Summon "Ogdoadic" monsters from the Graveyard, which triggers the effects of the Tributed "Mitsurugi" monsters in the process, providing card advantage and field presence. Alternatively, it pairs well with archetypes capable of quickly Summoning Rank 4 Xyz Monsters such as "[[Ryzeal]]", as the ability to Xyz Summon "King of the Feral Imps" provides easy access to "Mitsurugi" combo lines, not to mention the ability to Summon significant monsters with interaction whilst working within "Ryzeal's" Rank 4 lock once active.
