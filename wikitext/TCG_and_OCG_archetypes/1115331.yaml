  "'''K9'''" ({{Ruby|Ｋ９|ケーナイン}} ''Kē Nain'') is an archetype of mostly [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 5 monsters introduced in [[Deck-Build Pack: Justice Hunters]].

  ==Design==
  ===Etymology===
  "K9" is named after [[wikipedia:Police dog|K9]] police dogs, which is itself a homophone of the word "canine", referring to members of the [[wikipedia:Caninae|Caninae]] subfamily that encompasses dog-like animals. The names of some of the archetype's [[Xyz Monster]]s such as "Hound" and "Ripper" may be an allusion to the first official usage of dogs by the British police force, in which they used a pair of bloodhounds to try and track down the serial killer [[wikipedia:Jack the Ripper|Jack the Ripper]].

  ===Members===
  "K9" monsters are depicted as humanoid police agents with features of canid-based mythological creatures (except for "[[K9-66a Jokul|Jokul]]" and "[[K9-66b Lantern|Lantern]]", which appear to be ice and fire elementals instead). The [[Xyz Monster]]s represent the members transformed into upgraded, more monstrous versions of themselves. The Xyz Monsters' names are written in quotes, suggesting that they are codenames. The transformations are depicted in the Quick-Play Spells and Traps, which are called "Liberation" in Japanese and "Release" in the ''TCG''.

  Each member has a number in their name, which is stamped on shield-shaped dog tags that they wear (except "[[K9-ØØ Lupis|Lupis]]"), possibly indicating that they represent an identifier. The numbers are blue in base forms, but turn red as part of the transformations.

  ==Playstyle==
  "K9" is a [[Rank 5 Monster Cards|Rank 5]]-focused Deck. Each of the Main Deck monsters have the following effects:
  # If the opponent has 2 or more cards in their hand, they can be Normal Summoned without Tributing.
  # A unique effect to Special Summon a card from hand or Deck.
  # Another unique effect, usually one that generates [[advantage]].

  Main Deck monsters include:
  * "[[K9-17 Izuna]]" and "[[K9-ØØ Lupis]]", which can each be Summoned if the opponent activates a monster effect from hand or Graveyard. "Izuna" Summons from hand and can send a "K9" to the Graveyard, while "Lupis" can Summon itself from the hand or Graveyard, perform an Xyz Summon on the opponent's turn, and give the Xyz Monster targeting protection. They can be used as a standalone engine, punishing use of monster [[hand trap]]s while acting as hand traps themselves.
  * "[[K9-66a Jokul]]" and "[[K9-66b Lantern]]", which are extenders that also search. "Jokul" Summons itself and a Level 5 monster from the hand, and searches a "K9" monster. "Lantern" Summons itself and a Level 5 "K9" monster from the Graveyard, and searches a "K9" Spell/Trap.
  * "[[K9-04 Noroi]]" is the archetype's dedicated Normal Summon, which cannot Special Summon itself from hand, but can Summon a "K9" from Deck.

  As for Spells/Traps:
  * "[["A Case for K9"]]" is a searcher that can Set a "K9" Quick-Play if destroyed.
  * "[[K9-X Forced Release|X Forced Release]]" and "[[K9-LC Release Restraint|LC Release Restraint]]" are Quick-Play Spells that can Summon a "K9" Xyz, similar to "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" cards, then Set themselves from the Graveyard if a "K9" Xyz battles. "X Forced Release" requires a "K9" Xyz and can destroy an opponent's card, while "LC Release Restraint" can also use any Rank 5 monster as a target.
  * "[[K9-EW Special Release Experiment|EW Special Release Experiment]]" is a Trap that works like the Quick-Play Spell; it can Summon a "K9" from the Graveyard, then Summon a "K9" Xyz Monster using it as material.

  Externally, "[[Chaotic Elements]]" and "[[Seventh Tachyon]]"/"[[Seventh Ascension]]" can be used to search certain members of the archetype.

  There are five in-archetype Xyz monsters:
  * "[[K9-17 "Ripper"]]" is a WIND Rank 5 that can search a "K9" card, Set a Quick-Play if the opponent used a monster effect, and can negate a monster effect activated from the hand or Graveyard.
  * "[[K9-ØØ "Hound"]]" is a LIGHT Rank 5 that cannot be destroyed the turn it is Summoned, gains ATK for every opponent's monster effect activation, and can banish a card during the Standby Phase.
  * "[[K9-66X "Jacks"]]" is a DARK Rank 5 can destroy a monster and can situationally make another "K9" Xyz monster with it as material inflict double battle damage.
  * "[[K9-X "Werewolf"]]" is a LIGHT Rank 9 Xyz monster for the archetype; it can attack multiple times and banish a card from the opponent's hand, field, or Graveyard, depending on whose turn it is.
  Other Rank 5s (even LIGHT ones) should be run to supplement the strategy.

  This archetype has clear synergies with other Level/Rank 5-heavy archetypes, such as "[[Crystron]]" and "[[Vanquish Soul]]".
