  "'''Horus the Black Flame Dragon'''" (ホルスの{{Ruby|黒|こく}}{{Ruby|炎|えん}}{{Ruby|竜|りゅう}} ''Horusu no Kokuenryū'') is an [[archetype]] of three [[FIRE]] [[Dragon]] "[[LV]]" [[Monster Card|monsters]] first introduced in ''[[Soul of the Duelist]]'', and is a sub-archetype of the "[[Horus]]" archetype. They are one of two groups of Dragon "LV" monsters, the other being the "[[Armed Dragon]]" [[series]]. This archetype is used by [[Daigo Sorano]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime.

  They are similiar in appearance to "[[The Winged Dragon of Ra]]", both being based on the Egyptian deities. The focus of this archetype is that each individual monster would not turn against the [[controller]] once it is on the [[field]]. They do so via [[effect]]s such as [[Cannot change control|not switching sides]], being [[unaffected by Spell Cards]] and [[Negates the activation of Spell Cards|negating the activation of any Spell Card]].

  "[[Dark Horus]]" was later introduced as a [[Dark counterpart]] to "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8]]". The [[Metaphys]] Monster "[[Metaphys Horus]]" was introduced as a [[Wyrm]] [[Synchro Monster]] counterpart of "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6]]".

  == Playing style ==
  The major draw of this "LV" family is the capability of "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8", which can shut down the activation of any Spell Card as long as its [[face-up]] on the field. The dreaded [[Horus Lockdown]] involves a combo of "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8" and "[[Royal Decree]]", which shuts down the effects of Spells and [[Trap Card|Traps]]. The best part of this combo is that the player controlling "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8" is still able to use the effects of Spells, while their opponents cannot. A new variation of the lock down is to use "[[Tyrant's Temper]]" and then add in cards like "[[Skill Drain]]" and "Royal Decree", meaning it can negate monster effects as well. Due to this, Decks that do not focus around low [[Level]] monsters are limited against the new lockdown. Another option, if one is not willing to invest in the given Trap Cards, is to include "[[Destiny HERO - Plasma]]", which can easily be [[Special Summon]]ed by [[Tribute|Tributing]] three "[[Sheep Token]]s".

  Another version of this lockdown can also be achieved by merging the deck with the [[Vylon]] archetype (specifically the [[Vylon Omega]] Lock), which can also negating Monster Effects. This combination can offer better effectiveness compared to the previous version with "[[Destiny HERO - Plasma]]" due to "[[Vylon Omega]]" can negate monster effects from anywhere (unlike Plasma, which can only negate in-field effects), and Horus can also covering Omega's weaknesses from Spell/Trap destruction (due to the latter's dependency on Equip Cards). However, due to so many elements involved in this type of deck (largely due to requirements for "[[Vylon Element]]" combo), this deck type always suffers from consistency issues. However, once this lockdown has successfully hits the field, it is unlikely that the opponent will survive for long, or even break the  lock without specific counters. If "[[Steelswarm Roach]]" also present (with [[Xyz Material]]s), it will only make it worse for the opponent, due to its ability to negate any attempts of Special Summoning Level 5 or higher monster that may endanger Horus or Omega.
  [[Hieratic]] archetype featuring "[[Hieratic Dragon King of Atum]]" can also immensely accelerates this deck, due to its ability to drag "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6" straight from the Deck (albeit with 0 [[ATK]] and [[DEF]]), which allows you to immediately use "[[Level Up!]]" to Summon "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8" quickly. "[[Ninja Grandmaster Hanzo]]", combined with "[[Ninjitsu Art of Super-Transformation]]" are also excellent alternatives.
