  "'''Horus the Black Flame Dragon'''" (ホルスの{{Ruby|黒|こく}}{{Ruby|炎|えん}}{{Ruby|竜|りゅう}} ''Horusu no Kokuenryū'') is an [[archetype]] of three [[FIRE]] [[Dragon]] "[[LV]]" [[Monster Card|monsters]] first introduced in ''[[Soul of the Duelist]]'', and is a sub-archetype of the "[[Horus]]" archetype. They are one of two groups of Dragon "LV" monsters, the other being the "[[Armed Dragon]]" [[series]]. This archetype is used by [[Daigo Sorano]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime.

  ==Design==
  They are similar in appearance to "[[The Winged Dragon of Ra]]", both being based on the Egyptian deities. The focus of this archetype is that each individual monster would not turn against the [[controller]] once it is on the [[field]]. They do so via [[effect]]s such as [[Cannot change control|not switching sides]], being [[unaffected by Spell Cards]] and [[Negates the activation of Spell Cards|negating the activation of any Spell Card]].

  "[[Dark Horus]]" was later introduced as a [[Dark counterpart]] to "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8]]". The [[Metaphys]] Monster "[[Metaphys Horus]]" was introduced as a [[Wyrm]] [[Synchro Monster]] counterpart of "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6]]".

  == Playing style ==
  {{See also|Horus#Playing style}}

  The major draw of this "LV" family is "[[Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8]]", which can (non [[once per turn]]) negate Spell Cards as long as its [[face-up]] on the field. The dreaded [[Horus Lockdown]] involves a combo of "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8" and "[[Royal Decree]]", which shuts down the effects of Spells and [[Trap Card|Traps]]. Other cards like "[[Destiny HERO - Plasma]]" and "[[Vylon Omega]]" can shut down monster effects. However, the "LV" mechanic is inherently slow and inconsistent, with "Plasma" and "Vylon Omega" also being hard to pull off.

  The "[[Hieratic]]" archetype can immediately Summon "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6" from the Deck (although with 0 ATK/DEF), then immediately use "[[Level Up!]]" to Summon "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8" quickly. "[[Ninja Grandmaster Hanzo]]", combined with "[[Ninjitsu Art of Super-Transformation]]", is an alternative.
