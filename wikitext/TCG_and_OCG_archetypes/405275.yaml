  "'''Pendulumgraph'''" (ペンデュラムグラフ ''Pendyuramugurafu'') is an [[archetype]] that debuted in ''[[Structure Deck: Pendulum Evolution]]''. The archetype is a sub-archetype of the "[[Pendulum (archetype)|Pendulum]]" archetype.

  == Playing style ==
  The two main "Pendulumgraph" cards, "[[Time Pendulumgraph]]" and "[[Star Pendulumgraph]]", prevent the opponent from targeting your [[Spellcaster]] monsters with Trap and Spell effects respectively. In addition, the first enables destruction of both opposing cards and your own "[[Magician]]" Pendulum monsters, while the second lets you search for other "Magicians" from your deck whenever those get destroyed. 

  "[[Purple Poison Magician]]", "[[Black Fang Magician]]" and "[[Double Iris Magician]]" work well with "Pendulumgraph" cards, as their effects activate whenever they are destroyed. In particular, "Double Iris" directly supports the archetype as it can search any "Pendulumgraph" card. "[[Sky Iris]]" has good synergy with decks utilizing those cards.

  While "[[Odd-Eyes Pendulumgraph Dragon]]" doesn't have any direct synergy with the "Magician" playstyle that the other two "Pendulumgraph" cards work with, it is more suitable for the interchangeable playstyle of the "[[Odd-Eyes]]", "[[Performapal]]" and "Magician" archetypes together but "Pendulumgraph Dragon" still benefits from the same common support, such as being searchable by "[[Performapal Skullcrobat Joker]]", "Sky Iris", "[[Duelist Alliance (card)|Duelist Alliance]]" and "Double Iris".

  As per the [[Master Rule#New Master Rule|New Master Rule]], the use of both "Star Pendulumgraph" and "Time Pendulumgraph" at the same time alongside with cards in the Pendulum Zones will cause the player to have problems using other Spell and Trap cards (as they will be limited to just one).
