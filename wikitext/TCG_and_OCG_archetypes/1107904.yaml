  "'''Dominus'''" (ドミナス ''Dominasu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Normal Trap Card]]s that [[can be activated from the hand]] under certain conditions, but doing so prevents the player from activating the [[Monster effect|effects of monsters]] with certain [[Attribute]]s for the rest of the Duel.

  Its first member, "[[Dominus Purge]]", was released in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]'', while its first support card, "[[Songs of the Dominators]]", was only released three [[Core Booster|core boosters]] later in ''[[Alliance Insight]]''.
