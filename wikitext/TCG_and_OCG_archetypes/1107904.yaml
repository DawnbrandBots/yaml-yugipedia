  "'''Dominus'''" (ドミナス ''Dominasu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Trap Card]]s. They [[can be activated from the hand]] under certain conditions, but doing so prevents the player from activating certain monster effects.

  Its first member, "[[Dominus Purge]]", was released in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]'', while its first support card, "[[The Psalms of Kings]]", was only released three [[Core Booster|core boosters]] later in ''[[Alliance Insight]]''.
