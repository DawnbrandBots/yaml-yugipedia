  "'''Dominus'''" (ドミナス ''Dominasu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Normal Trap Card]]s that debutted in ''[[The Infinite Forbidden]]''.

  ==Design==
  "Dominus" cards depict large colorful creatures accompanied by young girls with the same color scheme. In Japanese, the archetype's name is a reading for some form of "X King", implying the large creatures are rulers of certain elements, while the concept art of "[[Dominus Impulse]]" labelling to its girl as "Spirit Princess" seems to indicate they serve them.

  Effect-wise, the cards all follow a very specific format: they can be [[activate]]d from the [[hand]] under a certain condition, but doing so prevents the player from activating the [[Monster effect|effects of monsters]] with certain [[Attribute]]s for the rest of the Duel. Their effects also have either a bonus if the player has a Trap in their [[Graveyard]] or a downside if they do not.

  The effect of (currently) the only support card of the archetype, "[[Songs of the Dominators]]", is also constructed in a very similar way, with the difference that it prevents the player from using monster effects in the hand, Graveyard, or [[banish]]ment for 2 turns.
