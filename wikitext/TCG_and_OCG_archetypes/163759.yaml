  "'''Number'''", known as "'''Numbers'''" ({{Ruby|Ｎｏ．|ナンバーズ}} ''Nanbāzu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[Xyz Monster]]s that are the focus of the story in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (manga)|manga]] series. Each "Number" monster has a corresponding [[wikipedia:Natural number|natural number]] included at the start of its name after "Number" (and occasionally a letter, such as "[[Number C|C]]"), with the exceptions of "[[Number XX: Utopic Dark Infinity]]" (which is used by [[Eve]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' manga) and "[[Number iC1000: Numerounius Numerounia]]" (whose name contains an [[wikipedia:Imaginary number|imaginary number]] instead).
  In addition to the "Number" monster archetype, there is a similar separated "[[Number (Spell/Trap archetype)|Number]]" archetype of supporting [[Spell]]s/[[Trap]]s: these cards differ from the monster archetype as their Japanese name contains 「ナンバーズ」 and not the full 「{{Ruby|Ｎｏ．|ナンバーズ}}」.

  == Background ==
  In the anime and manga, there are three basic "Number" monster variants:
  * [[Emperor's Key]] "Numbers" are the 100 pieces of [[Astral]]'s memory, with numbers from 1 to 100.
  * "[[Number 10X|Over-Hundred Numbers]]" are 7 monsters with numbers from 101 to 107 which are not pieces of [[Astral]]'s memory, but instead are the [[signature card]]s of the [[Seven Barian Emperors]].
  * "[[Barian Number]]s" are counterfeit cards created in the [[Fusionizer]] by [[Don Thousand]]; in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime, 1 000 000 of them were created, but only 5 are known by name, with numbers below 100 like the Emperor's Key versions.

  There are two special subgroups of Emperor's Key "Numbers": [[Mythyrian Numbers]] and [[Evolving Numbers]]. There are also several variants of the 100 original "Numbers": 23 "Chaos" forms ("[[Number C]]"), 4 "Shining" forms ("[[Number S]]"), 1 [[Rank-Down]] forms ("[[Number 39: Utopia Roots]]"), 2 [[Ranked-Up]] forms ("[[Number 39: Utopia Beyond]]" and "[[Number 99: Utopia Dragonar]]"), and 2 [[retrained]] counterparts of "[[Number 39: Utopia]]" ("[[Number 39: Utopia Double]]" and "[[Number 39: Utopia Rising]]").

  There are several variants of other "Numbers": the "Chaos" forms of the 7 Over-Hundred "Numbers" ("[[Number C10X]]"), and 4 versions of "Number 0" — 3 "[[Number F]]" forms ("[[Number F0: Utopic Future]]", its [[signature move]] counterpart "[[Number F0: Utopic Future Slash]]", and "[[Number F0: Utopic Draco Future]]") and 1 "Shining" form ("[[Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL]]"). There are also 3 unique "Numbers" that do not fit into any of the previous categories: "[[Number XX: Utopic Dark Infinity]]", "[[Number C1000: Numerounius]]", and "[[Number iC1000: Numerounius Numerounia]]".

  While all 100 Emperor's Key "Numbers" are said to exist in both the anime and the manga, neither continuity featured all of them. On May 17, 2019,<ref>{{cite web |author1=XBrain130 |title=[CP19] Last three cards |url=https://ygorganization.com/thisisepicalexaplaynumberssummon/ |website=The Organization |accessdate=10 May 2020 |date=17 May 2019}}</ref> with the reveal of "[[Number 26: Spaceway Octobypass]]", the identities of all 100 Numbers were now known (across the anime, manga, and ''[[TCG]]''/''[[OCG]]''). All 100 Emperor's Key "Numbers" have been released in the ''OCG'' as of June 20, 2020, and in the English ''TCG'' as of July 24, 2020.

  As stated by [[Satoshi Kuwabara]], "Number" monsters are created "carefully with attention to details, so that fans can enjoy it in various places", which often results in puns and second meanings for each "Number".<ref>[http://neoarkcradle.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=1070#p43321 neoarkcradle.net] (can be found in part 2 of the "Translated Twitter Segments Archive," near the bottom)</ref> Many of the "Numbers" are based on [[wikipedia:Japanese wordplay#Goroawase|goroawase]], a form of Japanese wordplay.

  == Anime ==
  During [[Astral]]'s battle against [[Don Thousand]], fragments of Astral's power were scattered across [[Earth (planet)|Earth]] and designated the location of the [[Numeron Code]]. They took the form of 50 "Numbers", among them the seven [[Mythyrian Numbers]]<ref name="ep140">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|140|ref}}</ref> and the four "[[Numeron]] Gate" monsters.<ref name="ep139">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|139|ref}}</ref>
  [[File:Blank Numbers Sphere.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Blank card|Blank]] "Numbers" encircling [[Yuma Tsukumo|Yuma]] within a [[Sphere Field]] after being released]]
  When [[Yuma Tsukumo]] unlocked [[The Door]] with his [[Emperor's Key]], he opened a portal between [[Astral World]] and his own, which allowed Astral to come into his world. Yuma found himself trapped within a sphere of [[blank card]]s, which shortly flew away.<ref name="ep1">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|1|ref}}</ref> Astral's remaining power and memories were scattered into 50 more "Number" cards. Astral cooperated with Yuma to regain his lost memories .<ref name="ep2">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|2|ref}}</ref> When Astral collected all of the cards, something else happened besides his memory recovery. Astral thought it'd cause something troublesome,<ref name="ep25">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|25|ref}}</ref> while [[Dr. Faker]] claims Astral will obtain a great power and use it for taking revenge on him.<ref name="ep31">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|31|ref}}</ref> It is later revealed that Astral will obtain the Numeron Code, which he was to use to annihilate [[Barian World]] in order to Rank-Up Astral World, but Yuma aborted this mission. However, Barian World's leaders, the [[Seven Barian Emperors]], were also trying to collect the "Numbers." If all "Numbers" were collected, they would obtain the Numeron Code and use it to destroy Astral World.
  <div style="float:right">[[File:Numbers.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The different "Number" symbols]]</div>
  Usually, "Numbers" are blank cards that take the form of something that whoever finds them desires the most, design themselves to fit their original owner's Decks and keep that form forever. Some Duelists may have more than one "Number" card that fit their Deck. Their card text is written in a strange [[Astral glyphs|alien language]] that only those who wield them can understand (in the dub, all "Numbers" appear normally like other cards seen with the exception of [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL - Episode 002|episode 2]], in which "[[Number 39: Utopia (anime)|Number 39: Utopia]]" is blurred). When they are Summoned, their respective numbers are printed on their users, appearing in many places as the forehead, neck, left and right hands (in [[Cameron Clix]]'s case, it appeared under his right eye and in [[Number 56's holder]]'s case, it appeared on his left shoulder).

  {{Anchor|Neutral Form}}When Summoned, most "Numbers" initially appear in a '''neutral form''' (ニュートラル{{Ruby|体|たい}} ''Nyūtoraru-tai'')<ref>{{cite web |title=ストラクチャーデッキ －オーバーレイ・ユニバース－ |trans-title=Structure Deck: Overlay Universe |url=https://www.yugioh-card.com/japan/products/sd42/ |website=Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game |lang=Japanese |accessdate=30 May 2021}}</ref>, often called a "sealed form" by fans. The "Number" then transforms into its full form (depicted in the card artwork) through various means. "Number" monsters are Summoned through a galaxy-like [[Overlay Network]] portal, in contrast to regular Xyz Monsters, which use a red spiral portal.<ref name="ep1" />

  Astral stated that there are 99 "Numbers",<ref name="ep2"/><ref name="ep3">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|3|ref}}</ref><ref name="ep10">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|10|ref}}</ref> but according to [[Kite Tenjo]] there are 100 "Numbers".<ref name="ep13">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|13|ref}}</ref> As Astral had successfully retained 1 of the "Numbers", "Utopia", it is possible Astral was referring to the ''other'' 99 "Numbers". However, [[Dr. Faker]] believes that, aside from 99 "Numbers" which are Astral's pieces of memory, Astral himself is "the Original Number" (ナンバーズのオリジナル, ''Nanbāzu no Orijinaru'').<ref name="ep31"/><ref name="ep22">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|22|ref}}</ref> Later Astral corrected himself, stating there are one hundred "Numbers".<ref name="ep82">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|82|ref}}</ref><ref name="ep83">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|83|ref}}</ref>
  [[File:Astral collecting the memories.png|left|200px|thumb|Astral absorbing memories from the cards]]
  A "Number" monster is absorbed into Astral when a Duelist using it is defeated. The "Number" can then be used by any Duelist whom Astral is currently with. Each "Number" contains a piece of Astral's memory, which he recovers each time he absorbs one. After Astral absorbs a "Number", they are stored in a [[Different Dimension Airship]] within the Emperor's Key. Each has its own pillar within the structure, engraved with its number.
  "Numbers" in the anime are dangerous cards as they can easily amplify the darkness and desires of their holder user, whether these causes were [[Mr. Kay|good]]<ref name="ep4">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|4|ref}}</ref> or [[Reginald Kastle|bad]]. The "Number" monsters can also easily possess their holder with their power with the exception of Yuma's possession of the Emperor's Key, [[Kite Tenjo]]'s [[Photon Transformation]], and the [[Vetrix Family]]'s [[crest]]s. Some individuals can overcome the possession of a "Number", as demonstrated by [[Shark]] with his "[[Number 32: Shark Drake (anime)|Number 32: Shark Drake]]". However, the power of Photon Transformation and the crests seem to be limited, and has fatal consequences and being used to wield a "Number" card will drastically exhaust their user.<ref name="ep40">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|40|ref}}</ref><ref name="ep49">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|49|ref}}</ref>
  When a [[Number holder]] has reached a high level of a certain emotion, [[Number C|"Chaos Numbers"]] start to appear. For example, Astral and Yuma obtained "[[Number C39: Utopia Ray (anime)|Utopia Ray]]" after Astral was happy to know Yuma considered him a friend.<ref name="ep18">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|18|ref}}</ref> [[Reginald Kastle]] also obtained "[[Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss (anime)|Shark Drake Veiss]]" after his desire for revenge was amplified by "Shark Drake".<ref name="ep58">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|58|ref}}</ref>
  <div style="float:right">[[File:Legendary Numbers.png|thumb|200px|Seven "Numbers" surrounding the [[Numeron Code]]]]</div>
  In the ''[[Barian Invasion]]'' arc, "[[Number 10X|Numbers 10X]]" are introduced as the signature cards of the [[Seven Barian Emperors]]. Astral cannot absorb them, as they are not part of his memories.<ref name="ep86">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|86|ref}}</ref> They were later revealed to be created by [[Don Thousand]] as a means to release himself from his prison and restore his power.
  Later on, the [[Mythyrian Numbers]] were introduced by [[Vector]] and Don Thousand that are located in [[Number ruins|ruins]] across the world, protected by [[Number Guardian|guardians]]. Each of these "Numbers" corresponds to a legend inscribed on the walls of the ruins, telling the story of the person who occupied that location in a previous era, before they became ruins due to the ravages of time.<ref name="ep99">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|99|ref}}</ref> Rather than take their form based on their holder's Deck, they take a form relative to the legend that is described.
  "Numbers" can be [[Rank-Up|Ranked-Up]] as seen when Yuma/Astral used "[[Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force]]" to Summon "[[Number 39: Utopia Beyond (anime)|Number 39: Utopia Beyond]]".<ref name="ep142">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|142|ref}}</ref> "Numbers" can also be Ranked-Down, as seen when Yuma performed a Rank-Down with "[[Rank-Down-Magic Numeron Fall (anime)|Rank-Down-Magic Numeron Fall]]" to Summon "[[Number 39: Utopia Roots (anime)|Number 39: Utopia Roots]]".<ref name="ep121">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|121|ref}}</ref>
  What sets "Numbers" apart from other [[Xyz Monster]]s in the anime is that they can only be [[destroyed by battle]] by another "Number",<ref name="ep2" /> though this is a [[card effect]] and thus can be [[negate]]d.<ref name="ep10" /> In the TCG/OCG, "[[Number Wall]]" provides this protection instead.
  "Numbers" are the result of great power being sealed into a card, as demonstrated by Yuma's "[[Number F0: Utopic Future (anime)|Number F0: Utopic Future]]", which was created through Yuma's power to believe in others. As a result, "Numbers" possess powers far beyond that of ordinary Xyz Monsters.

  == Manga ==
  <div style="float:right">[[File:ZX2 - Yuma opens the door.png|left|200px|thumb|Yuma releasing the "Numbers"]]</div>
  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (manga)|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' manga, "Numbers" are held under the [[The Door#Manga|diabolical door]] along with [[Astral (manga)|Astral]]. As [[Yuma Tsukumo (manga)|Yuma]] finally opens the door during his Duel with [[Ryoga Kamishiro (manga)|Shark]], a huge light appears and numerous [[blank card]]s flow out of the door in every direction. Astral stated that "Numbers" are fragments of his memories, and that he shall collect all "Numbers" in order to retrieve his memories. Also, he says "Numbers" battle to absorb each other so, if he and Yuma lose, he will disappear. When Astral obtained a memory piece from "[[No. 17: Leviathan Dragon (manga)|Number 17: Leviathan Dragon]]", he said his memory is divided into 100 "Number" cards.<ref name="r4">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|4|ref}}</ref> This amount of number is later confirmed by both [[Kaito Tenjo (manga)|Kaito Tenjo]]<ref name="r7">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|7|ref}}</ref> and [[Mr. Heartland (manga)|Mr. Heartland]].<ref name="r9">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|9|ref}}</ref>
  [[File:Various Numbers surrounding Luna.png|thumb|left|Various "Numbers" along with [[Luna (ZEXAL)|Luna]]]]
  Like in the anime, "Numbers" are blank cards that take the form of something that whoever finds them desires the most, design themselves to fit their original owner's Decks and keep that form forever. Some Duelists may have more than one "Number" card that fit their Deck. What sets "Numbers" apart from other [[Xyz Monster]]s in the manga is that they can only be [[destroyed by battle]] by another "Number",<ref name="ep2" /> though this is a [[card effect]] and thus can be [[negate]]d.<ref name="ep10" /> In the TCG/OCG, "[[Number Wall]]" provides this protection instead. However, [[Kyoji Yagumo]] has shown an unique ability of manipulation with the "Numbers": Molding them according to his needs since he claims not to have any desires .<ref name="r34">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|34|ref}}</ref>
  Yuma believes the power of the "Numbers" are not evil and that if a good person had them, it would be okay.<ref name="r20">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|20|ref}}</ref> According to [[Luna (ZEXAL)|Luna]], "Numbers" are mirrors that reflect the hearts of the people. For example, when Shark had "Leviathan Dragon", his heart was full of darkness and then dominated, but Yuma and Astral freed him from that darkness, which made him able to possess a "Number" without falling under its power.<ref name="r19">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|19|ref}}</ref> Luna believes that the very fact that "Numbers" can be good or evil means they should not exist, as people will fight over them regardless.
  It seems that just like how a "Number" takes form after their holder, their powers do so as well. The powers a "Number" can possess is made clear in the manga; while "[[No. 63: Shamoji Soldier (manga)|Number 63: Shamoji Soldier]]" helped [[Number 63's holder|its unsuccessful holder]] on [[Poka Poka Restaurant|his restaurant]],<ref name="r20"/> "[[No. 13: Cain's Doom (manga)|Number 13: Cain's Doom]]" and "[[No. 31: Abel's Doom (manga)|Number 31: Abel's Doom]]" are dangerous "Numbers" who inflict real damage to people and can even put their lives in danger.<ref name="r30">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|30|ref}}</ref>
  It was also shown that "Numbers" can evolve into [[Number S|Shining Number]]s, as seen when Yuma evolved "[[No. 39: Utopia (manga)|Number 39: Utopia]]" into "[[No. S39: Utopia One (manga)|Number S39: Utopia One]]".<ref name="r32">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|32|ref}}</ref>

  ==== Mythyrian Numbers ====
  {{main|Mythyrian Numbers}}
  Mythyrian "Numbers" are a group of special "Number" cards that are located in [[Number ruins|ruins]]. They are still part of the original 100 "Numbers" of the [[Emperor's Key]].

  ==== Evolving Numbers ====
  {{main|Evolving Numbers}}
  Evolving "Numbers" are a group of special "Number" cards that remain [[Blank card|blank]] until the user decides to molde them to face a specific threat. They are still part of the original 100 "Numbers" of the [[Emperor's Key]] (with the exception of "[[No. S0: Hope ZEXAL (manga)|No. S0: Hope ZEXAL]]").

  ====Numbers with Forms====
  Among the numbers there are also some that take on a different form depending on their own effect.

  === Barian Numbers ===
  {{main|Barian Number}}
  These "Numbers" are creations of [[Don Thousand]] and a different series aside from the originals. All of them were produced and contained in the [[Fusionizer]]s.

  === Number 10X (Over-Hundred Number) ===
  {{main|Number 10X}}
  "Number 10X" (read as ''Over-Hundred Numbers'') are the signature "Number" cards of the [[Seven Barian Emperors]], whose numbering go over the limit of 100. They were created by [[Don Thousand]] to suppress the Emperors' memories of their past lives as humans.

  === Number C (Chaos Number) ===
  {{main|Number C}}
  "Number C" (read as ''Chaos Number'') are upgraded versions of the base "Number", which are Summoned by [[Xyz Material|overlaying]] their base counterpart through [[Xyz Evolution#Chaos Xyz Evolution|Chaos Xyz Evolution]], "[[Rank-Up-Magic]]" cards, "[[Chaos Field (ZEXAL)|Chaos Field]]", and "[[Don Thousand's Throne (anime)|Don Thousand's Throne]]". "[[Number C1000: Numerounius]]" is also listed in this group, despite being a unique "Number", an evolution of neither an Original nor an "Over Hundred" "Number" monster.

  ==== Ultimate Utopia Ray ====
  "Ultimate Utopia Ray" monsters, known in the ''[[OCG]]'' as "Equipped Unions", are [[retrained]] [[counterpart]]s of "[[Number C39: Utopia Ray]]", [[equip]]ped with a "[[ZW -]]" [[Xyz Monster]]. They are only treated to be part of the "Number C" archetype due to having a [[name condition]] that always treats their name as their original form's one.

  ==== Number C10X (Chaos Over-Hundred Number) ====
  {{main|Number C10X}}
  "Number C10X" (read as ''Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers'') are upgraded versions of the base "Number 10X", which are Summoned by "[[Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Barian's Force]]" or "[[Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One]]", using their base form ("Number 10X") as Material.

  ==== Number iC (Chaos Imaginary Number) ====
  {{main|Number C#Number iC (Chaos Imaginary Number)}}
  "[[Number iC1000: Numerounius Numerounia]]" was the single instance where a form of [[Xyz Evolution#Chaos Xyz Evolution|Chaos Xyz Evolution]] was performed on a [[Monster Card|monster]] that was already a "[[Number C|Chaos Number]]", in this case by [[Don Thousand]], Summoning what he called a "Chaos Imaginary Number", referencing the mathematical concept of [[wikipedia:Imaginary number|imaginary numbers]]. Due to this card's name ({{Ruby|Ｃ|カオス}}{{Ruby|ｉ|イマジナリー}}{{Ruby|Ｎｏ．|ナンバーズ}} ''Kaosu Imajinarī Nanbāzu'', "Chaos Imaginary Numbers"), it is not a true member of the "Number C" ({{Ruby|Ｃ|カオス}}{{Ruby|Ｎｏ．|ナンバーズ}} ''Kaosu Nanbāzu'', "Chaos Numbers") archetype.

  === Number S (Shining Number) ===
  {{main|Number S}}
  "Number S" monsters (read as ''Shining Number'') are upgraded versions of the base "Numbers", which are Summoned by [[Xyz Material|overlaying]] their base counterpart through [[Xyz Evolution#Shining Xyz Evolution|Shining Xyz Evolution]]. This evolution only exists in the manga, and can be considered the manga's counterpart of Chaos Xyz Evolution.

  === Number F (Future Number) ===
  {{main|Number F}}
  These "Numbers" are born from [[Yuma Tsukumo]]'s own power and belief in the future. "[[Number F0: Utopic Future]]" first appeared during his final Duel with [[Astral]].

  === Rank-Up Numbers ===
  These are upgraded forms of regular "Numbers", which are [[Xyz Summon]]ed by [[Xyz Material|overlaying]] their base form through [[Xyz Evolution#Rank-Up Xyz Evolution|Rank-Up Xyz Evolution]]. Unlike other upgraded forms, these "Numbers" don't have a prefix ("[[Xyz Evolution#Chaos Xyz Evolution|C]]" or "[[Xyz Evolution#Shining Xyz Evolution|S]]"). They are Summoned using the effect of "[[Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic Astral Force]]" or "[[Hyper Rank-Up-Magic Utopiforce]]".

Yuya recognized it as a "Number", calling it a "legend-class Duel Monster". Eve claimed to have acquired it by traveling through space and time. The two "X" symbols on this monster's body are [[Barian glyphs]], implying that this monster comes from the [[Barian World]].

  == Trivia ==
  * With {{hardcoded query|{{#ask: [[Archseries::Number]] [[Concept:CG cards]]|format=count}}}} members (excluding the 4 [[Boss Duel]]-only Tokens Summoned by "[[Don Thousand/Spell B]]"), the "Number" archetype has the most dedicated members of any archetype in the ''[[TCG]]''/''[[OCG]]''. This is only surpassed by the other "[[Number (Spell/Trap archetype)|Number]]" archetype (ナンバーズ ''Nanbāzu'', "Numbers"), which this one ({{Ruby|Ｎｏ．|ナンバーズ}} ''Nanbāzu'', "Numbers") is a sub-archetype of, with {{hardcoded query|{{#ask: [[Archseries::Number (Spell/Trap archetype)]] [[Concept:CG cards]]|format=count}}}} members: all of the "Number" Xyz Monsters, plus "[[Numeral Hunter]]" and {{hardcoded query|{{#ask: [[Archseries::Number (Spell/Trap archetype)]] [[Concept:CG non-monster cards]]|format=count}}}} [[Spell Card|Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s.
  * There are no [[Creator God]], [[Cyberse]], [[Divine-Beast]], [[Fish]], [[Illusion]], [[Reptile]], or [[Thunder]] "Number" monsters.
  * In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links]]'', the following description of "Number" monsters was given in the event details for "[[Shark Attack: Numbers Appear!]]" and "[[Number Hunter: Kite Tenjo!]]":
  {{Quote|Numbers are [[Xyz Monster]]s that have certain numbers in their names. Each of these one hundred cards is a piece of [[Astral]]'s memory. Many of those who get their hands on Numbers will be possessed, often amplifying their darkness and desires.}}
