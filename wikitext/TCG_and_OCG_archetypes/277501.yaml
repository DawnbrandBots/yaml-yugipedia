  "'''Number 10X'''", known as "'''Numbers 10X'''" ({{Ruby|Ｎｏ．|ナンバーズ}}１０Ｘ ''Nanbāzu Hyaku'')  in the ''[[OCG]]'', and referred to as "'''Number Over One Hundred'''" or "'''Number Over a Hundred'''" in the anime (オーバー・ハンドレッド{{Ruby|Ｎｏ．|ナンバーズ}} ''Ōbā Handoreddo Nanbāzu'', "'''Over-Hundred Numbers'''" in the Japanese version)<ref name="ep86">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|86|ref}}</ref>, is a sub-[[archetype]] of the "[[Number]]" archetype used by the [[Seven Barian Emperors]] as their [[signature card]]s in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime. All "Number 10X" base monsters are [[Rank]] 4, with the exception of the Rank 8 "[[Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]"; each of them also has its own [[Card evolutions|upgraded]] "[[Number C10X]]" form.
  The archetype was first supported in the ''OCG''/''[[TCG]]'' by "[[Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One]]".

  == Mechanics ==
  This archetype's name is somewhat unusual in that the exact string "10X" does not actually appear in any of its members' names. Rather, the clause 「Ｘは１～７の任意の数値」 (X is any number between 1 and 7) is written on the support cards for the archetype in the anime. The ''OCG''/''TCG'' instead use the phrase 「「Ｎｏ．１０１」～「Ｎｏ．１０７」のいずれかをカード名に含むモンスター」 ("Number" monster that has a number between "101" and "107" in its name / "Number" monsters with a number between "101" and "107" in their names).

  == Anime ==
  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'' anime, the "Number 10X" monsters were malignant "[[Number]]" cards created by [[Don Thousand]] to corrupt the [[Seven Barian Emperors]], who were transformed due to their connection to the [[Mythyrian Numbers]]. When each of the Barian Emperors was about to die, Don Thousand would appear to them and attach each of the "Numbers" to their souls, thus filling them with hate (besides [[Reginald Kastle|Nash]], who revealed that he let himself be a [[Barian]] of his fateful volition). This corrupted their human memories and allowed them to serve him in the restoration of his power. The corruption of each of the Emperors seemed to vary depending on how much Don Thousand manipulated and tormented their previous lives.
  The falsified memories they contained could be countered by their corresponding Mythyrian Number.<ref name="ep130">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|130|ref}}</ref> Unlike the first 100 "Number" cards, [[Astral]] could not absorb the "Number 10X" cards since they were not pieces of his memory.<ref name="ep86"/>
  If a Barian Emperor's "Number 10X" was [[destroy]]ed by their corresponding Mythyrian Number and then said Barian Emperor lost in the same Duel, they would also lose the ability to play their "Number 10X".<ref name="ep132">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|132|ref}}</ref>
  The ultimate destiny of the "Number 10X" cards in the anime following the defeat of the Seven Barian Emperors is unknown; however, like the other "Number" cards created by Don Thousand, they were likely destroyed after Nash's defeat by [[Yuma Tsukumo]] and Astral.
