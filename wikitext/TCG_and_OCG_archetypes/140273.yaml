  "'''Resonator'''" (リゾネーター ''Rizonētā'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Fiend]] [[Tuner monster]]s of all six main [[Attribute]]s used by [[Jack Atlas]] and [[Imposter Jack Atlas|his imposter]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, as well as his [[Jack Atlas (ARC-V)|alternate universe counterpart]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. Their [[Card effect|effects]] are centered around [[Synchro Summon]]ing and [[stall]]ing. The "Resonator" archetype is closely tied to the "[[Red Dragon Archfiend (archetype)|Red Dragon Archfiend]]" archetype and the [[King]] [[series]], with all three themes designed to work in tandem with each other.

  ==Design==
  "Resonator" monsters are depicted as small demons usually wield a tuning fork and a mallet, with some also carrying a third object related to their name.

  In the anime, "[[Clock Resonator]]" is a [[Machine]] monster, but was changed to a Fiend when released to match the other members.

  ==Playing style==
  The earliest "Resonator" monsters generally have effects that protect them from destruction. Later ones, and their support, shift to enabling swarming and Synchro combos, mainly interacting with cards used by or designed for Jack; these include high-Level, [[DARK]], and/or [[Dragon]] [[Synchro Monster]]s, "[[Red Dragon Archfiend]]"-specific support, or low-Level [[Fiend]]s. As of [[Series 12]], "Resonator" monsters are near-exclusively played in RDA Decks due to their cross-support.
