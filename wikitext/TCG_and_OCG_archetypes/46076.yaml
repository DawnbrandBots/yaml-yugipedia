  "'''Morphtronic'''", known as "'''Deformer'''" ({{Ruby|Ｄ|ディフォーマー}} ''Difōmā'') in the Japanese version, is an [[archetype]] of cards used by [[Leo]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' and introduced in ''[[Crossroads of Chaos]]''. The archetype includes various [[Type]]s and [[Attribute]]s, but most members are [[EARTH]] and/or [[Machine]], with several being [[LIGHT]] and/or [[Thunder]].

  They are depicted in how they "morph" when they change their [[battle position]], which changes their effect(s) and appearance (humanoid in [[Attack Position]]; item in [[Defense Position]]). They transform into small "electronic" household items, like magnets and mobile phones.

  This archetype is related to the "[[Power Tool]]" archetype, with some overlapping support arising from their use by the same character in the anime. Some cards in this archetype are designed to facilitate the summon of "Power Tool" monsters and support them once they are on the field.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Morphtronic" archetype originally revolved around manipulating its monsters' [[battle position]]s. Each "Morphtronic" Main Deck monster has two on-field effects, one per position, with each effect only usable in the corresponding position. Most of these effects are related to battle, with Attack Position effects corresponding to offense and Defense Position focusing on defense. The battle-related "Morphtronic" monsters became obsolete as the game progressed.

  Modern "Morphtronic" Decks instead focus on swarming the field to make [[Extra Deck]] plays, spamming the field with [[Synchro Monster|Synchro]]s and [[Link Monster|Link]]s. This is enabled by a few "Morphtronic" monsters that have Special Summon effects. While in Attack Position:

  * "[[Morphtronic Celfon|Celfon]]" can roll a die and excavate cards equal to the result, and Special Summon 1 excavated Level 4 or lower "Morphtronic" monster.
  * "[[Morphtronic Smartfon|Smartfon]]" can roll a die and excavate cards equal to the result, and add 1 excavated "Morphtronic" card to the hand.
  * "[[Morphtronic Telefon|Telefon]]" can roll a die and Special Summon 1 "Morphtronic" monster from the GY whose Level is equal to or lower than the result.

  Notably, all of the above effects are soft [[once per turn]], meaning that multiple copies can each use their effect to generate advantage. 

  In particular, multiple copies of "Telefon" can create a [[controlled loop]]: a "Telefon" can Summon a second "Telefon" from the GY, the first "Telefon" can be used as material, then the second "Telefon" can revive the first one. Since "Telefon" is Level 1, it can't fail at Summoning itself. These loops can create massive boards, such as: "[[Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess]]" in the Extra Monster Zone (multi-monster negate; Forbidden), "[[Tri-Gate Wizard]]" beneath "Apollusa" (omni-negate), "[[G Golem Invalid Dolmen]]" to its left (protection from monster effects), and any of the "[[Knightmare]]" Link Monsters to the right of "Tri-Gate Wizard" (various other protections). Synchro monsters are also possible, though the archetype lacks many high Level non-Tuners of its own.

  The starter for this swarming-based "Morphtronic" playstyle is "[[Gadget Gamer]]", who can search for a Level 1 Machine (which all the above phone-formed "Morphtronic" monsters are), and then Special Summon it and "[[Gadget Hauler]]" from the Deck; this immediately sets up a Level 7 Synchro Summon (tying the deck's playstyle to the "[[Power Tool]]" Synchro Monsters).

  Further swarming can be achieved through "[[Machine Duplication]]", "[[Junk Box]]", "[[Morphtronic Converter]]", "[[Dimension Dice]]", "[[Morphtronic Repair Unit]]" and "[[D.D.R. - Different Dimension Reincarnation]]". "[[Power Tool Dragon]]" can be used to search for the latter two.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * Floodgates: As a combo Deck reliant on the GY, it is vulnerable to various floodgate cards like "[[Lose 1 Turn]]", "[[Summon Breaker]]", "[[Skill Drain]]", "[[Power Filter]]", "[[Macro Cosmos]]", and "[[Anti-Spell Fragrance]]".
  * Handtraps / Going Second: The Deck is relatively fragile to disruption - it is vulnerable to common handtraps and struggles to go second. This problem can be mitigated with external cards like the "[[Vernusylph]]s" and "[[Dimension Dice]]".
  ** "[[Mulcharmy Fuwalos]]", "[[Mulcharmy Meowls]]" and "[[Maxx "C"]]" (OCG) are dangers, though it's possible to Deck out the opponent if "Maxx "C"" is used too early.
  ** Cards like "[[D.D. Crow]]" and "[[Called by the Grave]]" can banish a "Telefon" from GY, potentially stopping a loop cold.
  ** "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" is effective due to how many Summons the Deck requires, though if done too early, it can be extended from (any means of reviving "Telefon" can start a loop again).
  * "Morphtronic" endboards usually aren't layered - they are mostly comprised of monsters on field. Therefore, board breakers like "[[Forbidden Droplet]]", "[[Dark Ruler No More]]", and "[[The Winged Dragon of Ra - Sphere Mode]]" are effective against the Deck. However, [[FTK]] variants obviously don't care, while variants using "[[T.G. Hyper Librarian]]" to draw handtraps are somewhat less vulnerable.
  * Link-/Synchro- spamming Decks will often run out of cards in the Extra Deck, leaving little/no follow-up for later turns, although external cards like "[[Pot of Avarice]]" and "[[Machina Overdrive]]" can help.
  * As most "Morphtronic" monsters are [[Machine]], anti-Machine cards like "[[System Down]]" and "[[Chimeratech Fortress Dragon]]" could be useful, although the archetype will often end on many generic (non-Machine) Extra Deck monsters.
  * "[[Power Tool Braver Dragon]]" is an important endboard card, but its power can be reduced easily with simple backrow removal cards like "[[Harpie's Feather Duster]]", "[[Galaxy Cyclone]]", or "[[Twin Twisters]]".
