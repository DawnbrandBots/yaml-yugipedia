  "'''Kashtira'''", known as "'''Kshatrira'''" (クシャトリラ ''Kushatorira'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of primarily [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 7 [[Psychic]] monsters introduced in ''[[Darkwing Blast]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 02: The New Broken Worlds|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#No. 01: Sharv Sarga}}

  ==Etymology==
  "Kshatrira" appears to be a portmanteau of [[wikipedia:Kshatriya|Kshatriya]] and ''ira'' (Latin for "anger"). The 3 Main Deck members introduced in "Darkwing Blast" are named after mythological creatures. Their names combine to form "UFO" ('''U'''nicorn, '''F'''enrir, and '''O'''gre), in reference for their role as an extraterrestrial invaders within the Visas storyline.

  ==Design==
  All members (and their structures, as depicted in "[[Kashtira Birth]]" and "[[Pressured Planet Wraitsoth]]") were depicted in a futuristic Japanese dystopian style. All "Kashtira" monsters have a primarily red and black color scheme, with purple accents on the Main Deck monsters. All "Kashtira" monsters are depicted as bio-mechanical beings with several parts of their body either grafted or replaced with cybernetic parts.

  The exceptions to these designs are "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]", who appears to wear a Japanese-style armor and has a similar "galactic arm" as "[[Visas Starfrost]]", and "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]", which is essentially "[[Pressured Planet Wraitsoth]]" (the home world of "Kashtira" monsters) summoned as a monster itself.

  Their own art, as well as related Spells and Traps, depict them as alien invaders onto "[[Primitive Planet Reichphobia]]" and later "[[Primeval Planet Perlereino]]", taking resources and abducting their inhabitants away in canisters (manifested in gameplay as banishing face-down).

  ==Playing style==
  "Kashtira" is an archetype focused around primarily [[Level]] 7 [[Psychic]] monsters and [[Banish|banishing]] cards face-down. Most members of the archetype, excluding "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]", are Level 7 monsters able to [[Special Summon]] themselves if the player controls no monsters or by some other condition, such as with "[[Scareclaw Kashtira]]" and "[[Tearlaments Kashtira]]", are able to search cards while on the field, and can banish their opponent's cards (from various different locations) if they attack or if the opponent activates a monster effect.

  The "U.F.O" Level 7 "Kashtira" monsters ("[[Kashtira Unicorn]]", "[[Kashtira Fenrir]]", and "[[Kashtira Ogre]]") are the key playmakers of the deck. Each of the "U.F.O" trio can be Special Summoned if you have no monsters on your field; each has an effect to search a "Kashtira" monster, spell, or trap card; and each has an effect to banish an opponent's card face-down from various places whenever they attack, or when any of the opponent's monsters activate their effects.

  |[[Kashtira Unicorn|Unicorn]]
  |"Kashtira" [[Spell card]]
  |1 card from the opponent's [[Extra Deck]].
  |Can search either "[[Kashtiratheosis]]" to summon another "Kashtira" monster for more search effects, or "[[Kashtira Birth]]" to utilize other "Kashtira" monsters in your hand or that are [[Banish|banished]]. Its banish effect is useful for eliminating potentially dangerous cards from the opponent's [[Extra Deck]].
  |-
  | [[Kashtira Fenrir|Fenrir]]
  |"Kashtira" [[Monster card]]
  |1 [[Face-up|face-up]] card on the opponent's [[Field]].
  |Can search "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]", which can be immediately Special Summoned by its own effect and activate its Level change effect. Its banish effect can be used as a form of removal when going second or as an interruption during the opponent's turn.
  |-
  | [[Kashtira Ogre|Ogre]]
  |"Kashtira" [[Trap card]]
  |1 of up to 5 card(s) [[Excavate|excavated]] from the opponent's top [[Deck]].
  |Can search either "[[Kashtira Preparations]]" to set up grind game, or "[[Kashtira Big Bang]]" as a removal option. Its banish effect allows the player to foresee any card that the opponent might draw in the next turn (provided that the opponent doesn't use any effect that has them [[Shuffle|shuffling]] their deck before their [[Draw Phase]]) and eliminate the one that might counter your game plans.
  |}

  This banish play style is further emphasized through their original boss monster "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]", a Rank 7 [[Xyz Monster]] with 0 ATK that can Special Summon more "Kashtira" monsters to the field for each [[Standby Phase]] and lockdown unused [[Main Monster Zone]]s as well as [[Spell & Trap Zone]]s each time an opponent's card in their possession is banished face-down.

  In ''[[Photon Hypernova]]'', the deck's swarming capability is enhanced with the introduction of "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]", a Level 4 [[FIRE]] [[Warrior]] monster that can special summon itself if you have a "Kashtira" monster on your field at a cost of locking you into Xyz summon that turn. "Riseheart" can banish a "Kashtira" card from your Deck to banish the top 3 cards of the opponent's Deck, face-down, and become Level 7 itself for use in [[Xyz Summon]]s and set up the banish zone in the progress.

  In addition, two "hybrid" extenders based on a "captured" members of the [[Broken World]] storyline were introduced; "[[Scareclaw Kashtira]]" and "[[Tearlaments Kashtira]]". Both has an effect to special summon themselves by banishing one "Kashtira" card or a card from their respective archetypes from player's hand or GY, and has a unique effect in reference to their "original" forms and were thus compatible with their original archetypes, allowing "Kashtira" Decks to be played in combination with "[[Scareclaw]]" and "[[Tearlaments]]" using these cards as a "bridge" to link them together.

  |[[Scareclaw Kashtira]]
  |[[Scareclaw Tri-Heart]]
  |
  * Can [[Defense Position attacker|attack in defense position]] using its [[DEF]].
  * [[Negate]] any effect(s) of monster(s) that were selected as an attack target by "Kashtira" monster until the [[End Phase]].
  |Versatile extender that can either "unbrick" your hand in case you opened with multiple "U.F.O Kashtiras" or set them up for special summon in the banish zone using either "[[Kashtira Birth]]" or "[[Kashtira Preparations]]". Its unique battle-related effects allows it to attack after being summoned with "[[Kashtiratheosis]]", as well as providing non-target effect [[negate]] whenever it or other "Kashtira" monster attacks, thus countering any battle-related monster effects or targeting protection in the process.
  |-
  |[[Tearlaments Kashtira]]
  |[[Tearlaments Kitkallos]]
  |
  * Can send 3 cards on top of either player's [[Deck]] to the [[Graveyard]] when summoned.
  * It it was sent to the Graveyard by a card effect, you can send 2 cards on top of your deck to GY.
  |Aside from its summoning condition, its milling effect has little to no synergy with "Kashtira" game plans, as "Kashtira" decks can search, dump, and banish their cards with good consistency without using random mill. This effect is, however, more useful in "[[Tearlaments]]" Deck, of which it can be used as a bridge for both theme's playstyle.
  |}

  The main offensive boss monster of "Kashtira" is "[[Kashtira Arise-Heart]]", a 3000 ATK monster able to be quickly Xyz Summoned once per turn using any 1 "Kashtira" monster on the field the same turn that "Shangri-Ira" used its effect and able to force any cards send to the GY to be banished instead, as well as granting itself more materials to use 3 materials and banish any card on the field, face-down.

  "Kashtira" Spell/Trap cards focus on summoning/recovering additional "Kashtira" monsters, and either banishing opponents' cards if the opponent activates a card of the same type, or activating an effect when they're banished themselves. When properly set up, "Kashtira" Spell/Trap provides an excellent resource recovery capabilities as well as a bonus interruption.

  |[[Normal Trap]]
  |

  |An "[[Evenly Matched]]"-like mass removal. Though it is usually played as a [[garnet]] to be banished with the effect of "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]" to summon the material from "Shangri-Ira".
  |}

  While "Kashtira" decks were usually played as a lockdown deck to prevent the opponent from summoning any monsters and/or using any Spell/Trap cards, the ability to quickly Summon various Level 7 monsters — usually without [[Normal Summon]] — also allows the deck to either form the core of the "7-Axis" strategy to exploit various generic [[Rank 7 Monster Cards|Rank 7 monsters]], or to further utilize various [[Tuner monster]] [[Hand trap|hand traps]] such as "[[Effect Veiler]]" or the [[Yo-kai Girl]] series to summon Level 8 or 10 [[Synchro Monster]]s. This is especially apparent after the [[forbidden|ban]] of "[[Kashtira Arise-Heart]]" and "[[Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker]]" in the ''[[TCG]]'' in late 2023 (due to these monsters were primarily used to facilitate lockdown), which resulted in the Deck being repurposed as a blind going second control/midrange strategy, of which it also managed to found competitive success like the "zone lock" variant.

  Externally, due to the aforementioned non-reliance on Normal Summon, "Kashtira" decks also synergize well with the [[Adventurer]] series, as "Kashtira" monsters can easily trigger the basic search effects of "[[Fateful Adventure]]". In addition, the two key interruptions of the series, "[[Wandering Gryphon Rider]]" and "[[Illegal Knight]]" are Level 7 monsters that can be either Special Summoned first by their own effects (which can be chained together to summon both at once) as a generic starter, as an additional extender/interruption while "[[Adventurer Token]]" is on the field, or as extra materials summoned through the effect of "Kashtira Birth".

  | opening = "[[Kashtira Unicorn]]" and no monsters on your field
  | end     = "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]" (with one [[Main Monster Zone]] or [[Spell & Trap Zone]] unusable) + "[[Kashtira Arise-Heart]]" ( + "[[Kashtira Fenrir]]" or "Kashtira Unicorn")
  | steps   = 
  # Special Summon "Kashtira Unicorn" from the hand.
  # Activate the effect of "Unicorn" to add "[[Kashtiratheosis]]".
  # Activate "Kashtiratheosis" by targeting "Unicorn" to Special Summon "Kashtira Fenrir" from the Deck.
  # Activate the effect of "Fenrir" to add "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]". 
  # Use "Fenrir" and "Unicorn" as [[Xyz Material]]s to [[Xyz Summon]] "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]". Order-wise, this step is interchangeable with the following step.
  # Activate the effect of "Riseheart" to Special Summon itself from the hand. Order-wise, this step is interchangeable with the previous step.
  # Activate the effect of "Riseheart" by banishing "[[Kashtira Big Bang]]", banishing the top 3 cards from your opponent's Deck face-down.
  # Activate the effects of "Shangri-Ira" and the banished "Big Bang" by targeting "Shangri-Ira" in a Chain; for the latter, add either "Fenrir" or "Unicorn" that is a material of "Shangri-Ira" to the hand then Special Summon it to the field.
  # Xyz Summon "[[Kashtira Arise-Heart]]" by using "Riseheart" as the sole material. Alternatively, "Riseheart" and the other "Kashtira" monster can be used to Xyz Summon another "Kashtira Shangi-Ira", then that newly Summoned "Shangri-Ira" can be used as the sole material to Xyz Summon "Arise-Heart" with 3 materials, enabling its Quick Effect to be activated as soon as it is Summoned (as opposed to the other method which leaves "Arise-Heart" with only 1 material).

  ===Weakness===
  * "Kashtira" deck relies heavily on [[banish]]ing cards to make their plays. Because of this, anti-banish floodgate such as "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" and "[[Chaos Hunter]]" can disable most of the main plays. "Chaos Hunter" in particular is especially dangerous in a [[Mirror Match]] due to its floodgate effect are one-sided and can also be easily summoned by the opponent's "Kashtira" cards.

  * As the "Kashtira" deck can Special Summon multiple times per turn "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" is a great threat to the deck, as it can remove all of the "Kashtira" monsters on the field, since none of them has protection against "Nibiru"'s effect nor can they negate "Nibiru"'s effect. In such cases, if the "Kashtira" Deck's user suspects the opponent has "Nibiru", they will most likely only end on a single "Arise-Heart" without Summoning "Shangri-Ira" (which can be done with 4 Normal or Special Summons). Conversely, cards that prevent Special Summoning, such as "[[Fossil Dyna Pachycephalo]]" can also shut down any "Kashtira" game plans.

  * In a dedicated zone lock strategy, any non-destruction removal effect or cards that can force the opponent's monster [[face-down]], such as that of "[[Book of Moon]]", "[[Book of Eclipse]]" or "[[Compulsory Evacuation Device]]" can easily take care of "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]". Similarly, "[[Kaiju]]" and similar monsters can also remove "Shangri-Ira" from the field and bypass its protection effect.

  * In the "pure" version of the deck, "Kashtira" monsters requires either having no monsters on your field (in the case of the three main U.F.O monsters) or already having a "Kashtira" monster on the field (in the case of "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]"), cards that can be Summoned or placed onto the opponent's field before they could Summon any "Kashtira" monsters, such as "[[Mushroom Man 2]]", can prevent them from Summoning anything unless player already have "[[Kashtira Birth]]" on the hand.
  ** In addition, if you opened your hand with the multiple "U.F.O Kashtira", this would often results into them being a dead card in your hand if you don't have "Kashtira Birth" or "[[Kashtira Preparations]]" on the field.

  * Since the deck consists of monsters of multiple [[Attribute]]s, "[[Gozen Match]]" can also shut down a "Kashtira" deck from Summoning more monsters.

  * Since the "Kashtira" Deck will most likely use the effect of "Shangri-Ira" during the opponent's Standby Phase and/or will inevitably activate the effect of "Arise-Heart", this enables the opponent's "[[Triple Tactics Thrust]]" and/or "[[Triple Tactics Talent]]" to be useable (with the former also capable of searching the latter). "Talents" can then be used to attempt to take control of "Arise-Heart", allowing the opponent to use "Arise-Heart" against the "Kashtira" user.
  ** If the "Kashtira" user uses the Quick Effect of "Arise-Heart" to banish itself in response to "Talents" (which removes its threat regardless), the other "Kashtira" monsters are still useful for the opponent to steal (e.g. taking control of "Shangri-Ira" then using it as material for a [[Link Summon]] or even Xyz Summoning another "Arise-Heart" using "Shangri-Ira", will free up their own blocked zones).
