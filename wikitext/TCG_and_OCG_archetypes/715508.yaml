  "'''Kashtira'''", known as "'''Kshatrira'''" (クシャトリラ ''Kushatorira'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of primarily [[Level]]/[[Rank]] 7 [[Psychic]] monsters introduced in ''[[Darkwing Blast]]''.

  == Lore ==
  {{Main|The Valuable Book EX 3 card storylines#No. 02: The New Broken Worlds|The Valuable Book EX 4 card storylines#No. 01: Sharv Sarga}}

  == Etymology ==
  "Kshatrira" appears to be a portmanteau of [[wikipedia:Kshatriya|Kshatriya]] and ''ira'' (Latin for "anger"). The 3 Main Deck members introduced in "Darkwing Blast" are named after mythological creatures. Their names combine to form "UFO" ('''U'''nicorn, '''F'''enrir, and '''O'''gre), in reference for their role as an extraterrestrial invaders within the Visas storyline.

  == Design ==
  All members (and their structures, as depicted in "[[Kashtira Birth]]" and "[[Pressured Planet Wraitsoth]]") were depicted in a futuristic Japanese dystopian style, being themed after Japanese warlord [[wikipedia:Oda Nobunaga|Oda Nobunaga]] and his conquest during the Sengoku era. This is especially apparent with how "Wraitsoth" is being referred as the "Sixth Broken World" in the ''OCG'', in reference to Nobunaga's moniker of ''Dairokuten Maō'' (第六天魔王, lit. "Demon King of the Sixth Heaven").

  All "Kashtira" monsters have a primarily red and black color scheme, with purple accents on the Main Deck monsters. All "Kashtira" monsters are depicted as bio-mechanical beings with several parts of their body either grafted or replaced with cybernetic parts.

  The exceptions to these designs are "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]", who as a "Nobunaga stand-in" wears a Japanese-style armor and has a similar "galactic arm" as "[[Visas Starfrost]]", and "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]", which is essentially "[[Pressured Planet Wraitsoth]]" (the home world of "Kashtira" monsters) summoned as a monster itself.

  Their own art, as well as related Spells and Traps, depict them as alien invaders onto "[[Primitive Planet Reichphobia]]" and later "[[Primeval Planet Perlereino]]", taking resources and abducting their inhabitants away in canisters (manifested in gameplay as banishing face-down).

  == Playing style ==
  "Kashtira" is an archetype focused around [[Level]] 7 [[Psychic]] monsters, [[banish]]ing cards face down, and summoning its Rank 7 boss monsters. Most members can be Special Summoned if the player controls no monsters or by some other condition.

  The "U.F.O" Level 7 "Kashtira" monsters ("[[Kashtira Unicorn]]", "[[Kashtira Fenrir]]", and "[[Kashtira Ogre]]") are the key playmakers of the deck. Each of the "U.F.O" trio can be Special Summoned if you have no monsters on your field; "Unicorn" searches an archetypical Spell, "Fenrir" searches a monster, and "Ogre" searches a Trap. Each also has an effect to banish an opponent's card face-down from various places whenever they attack or when any of the opponent's monsters activate their effects.

  "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]", introduced in ''[[Photon Hypernova]]'', is a Level 4 FIRE Warrior that can Special Summon itself if you control a "Kashtira" monster, but locks you into Xyz monsters, then can turn itself into Level 7 by banishing cards from your opponent's Deck face-down. This set also introduced "[[Scareclaw Kashtira]]" and "[[Tearlaments Kashtira]]", connecting this archetype to the other archetypes of the [[Broken World]] storyline.

  |[[Kashtira Unicorn|Unicorn]]
  |"Kashtira" [[Spell card]]
  |1 card from the opponent's [[Extra Deck]].
  |Can search either "[[Kashtiratheosis]]" to summon another "Kashtira" monster for more search effects, or "[[Kashtira Birth]]" to utilize other "Kashtira" monsters in your hand or that are [[Banish|banished]]. Its banish effect is useful for eliminating potentially dangerous cards from the opponent's [[Extra Deck]].
  |-
  | [[Kashtira Fenrir|Fenrir]]
  |"Kashtira" [[Monster card]]
  |1 [[face-up]] card on the opponent's [[Field]].
  |Can search "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]", which can be immediately Special Summoned by its own effect and activate its Level change effect. Its banish effect can be used as a form of removal when going second or as an interruption during the opponent's turn.
  |-
  | [[Kashtira Ogre|Ogre]]
  |"Kashtira" [[Trap card]]
  |1 of up to 5 card(s) [[excavate]]d from the top of the opponent's [[Deck]].
  |Can search either "[[Kashtira Preparations]]" to set up grind game, or "[[Kashtira Big Bang]]" as a removal option. Its banish effect allows the player to foresee any card that the opponent might draw in the next turn (provided that the opponent doesn't use any effect that has them [[Shuffle|shuffling]] their deck before their [[Draw Phase]]) and eliminate the one that might counter your game plans.

  |Main extender that can be Special Summoned if you control a "Kashtira" monster. Its banish and level change effect is typically used while "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]" is on the field to satisfy the alternate summoning condition of "[[Kashtira Arise-Heart]]".

  |
  * Can [[Defense Position attacker|attack in defense position]] using its [[DEF]].
  * [[Negate]] any effect(s) of monster(s) that were selected as an attack target by "Kashtira" monster until the [[End Phase]].
  |Versatile extender that can either "unbrick" your hand in case you opened with multiple "U.F.O Kashtiras" or set them up for Special Summon from your banishment using either "[[Kashtira Birth]]" or "[[Kashtira Preparations]]". Its unique battle-related effects allows it to attack after being summoned with "[[Kashtiratheosis]]", as well as providing non-target effect [[negate]] whenever it or another "Kashtira" monster attacks, thus countering any battle-related monster effects or targeting protection in the process.
  |-
  |[[Tearlaments Kashtira]]
  |[[Tearlaments Kitkallos]]
  |
  * Can send 3 cards on top of either player's [[Deck]] to the [[Graveyard]] when summoned.
  * If it was sent to the Graveyard by a card effect, you can send 2 cards on top of your deck to GY.
  |Aside from its summoning condition, its milling effect has little to no synergy with "Kashtira" game plans, as "Kashtira" decks can search, dump, and banish their cards with good consistency without using random mill (aside from having "Kashtira Arise-Heart"). This effect is, however, more useful in "[[Tearlaments]]" decks, of which it can be used as a bridge for both themes' playstyles.
  |}

  The two main boss monsters are:
  * "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]", the original boss monster, which Special Summons a "Kashtira" monster from Deck each Standby Phase, and every time a card is banished face-down, it can lock an opponent's Monster or Spell/Trap zone.
  * "[[Kashtira Arise-Heart]]" (''OCG'' only), which banishes any card that would be sent to the GY, can banish a monster once per turn. Also, every time a card is banished face-down, it will attach a banished card as material.

  "Kashtira" Spell/Trap cards focus on summoning/recovering additional "Kashtira" monsters, and either banishing opponents' cards if the opponent activates a card of the same type, or activating an effect when they are banished themselves. When properly set up, they provide excellent resource recovery capabilities as well as a bonus interruption.

  * When it is banished; add 1 "Kashtira" card from Banishment to your hand.
  |Extender that is easily searchable through "[[Kashtira Unicorn]]" for consistency boost and more swarming capabilities.

  * If it is banished while a "Kashtira" monster is on your field; target 1 [[Effect Monster]] your opponent controls and [[negate]] its effect until the End Phase.
  |Situational ATK booster that is only usable within the theme by banishing "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]". While not often used, it is primarily utilized for its negation effect that can be triggered by banishing it with "Riseheart" or the "Hybrid Kashtira", or being detached from "Arise-Heart".
  |-
  |[[Kashtira Preparations|Preparations]]
  |[[Continuous Trap]]
  |
  * During either player's turn, you can special summon 1 "Kastira" monster from your hand or in your Banishment.
  * If the opponent has activated a [[Trap Card]] while this card and a "Kashtira" monster is already face-up on the field; look at your opponent's hand and banish 1 of their card face-down.
  |Secondary resource recovery tool, being capable of summoning "Arise-Heart" or "Shangri-Ira" in your Banishment back to the field, as well as punishing the opponent from using Trap Cards.
  |-
  |[[Kashtira Big Bang|Big Bang]]
  |[[Normal Trap]]
  |
  * If a "Kashtira" monster is on the field and either player [[control]]s two or more monsters; they must banish these monster(s) face-down until they have only one monster.
  * If banished; target 1 "Kashtira" Xyz monster, add 1 "Kashtira" monster [[Attaches as Xyz Material|attached to it]] to your hand, then you can special summon it.
  |An "[[Evenly Matched]]"-like mass removal. Though it is usually played as a [[garnet]] to be banished with the effect of "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]" to summon the material from "Shangri-Ira".

  Before the various bans in the ''TCG'' around late 2023, "Kashtira" was usually played as a lockdown Deck. "[[Number 89: Diablosis the Mind Hacker]]" (now banned in the ''[[TCG]]'') helped this strategy immensely, as it can banish face-down multiple times in a turn. When combined with multiple "Shangri-Ira", it could easily lock all 5 Main Monster Zones or all 5 Spell/Trap Zones. "Arise-Heart" (also banned in the ''TCG'') furthered this gameplan by disabling any GY-reliant effects the opponent had. In the ''OCG'', while those two monsters are not banned, the two best Main Deck monsters in "Fenrir" and "Unicorn" were banned/limited, respectively.

  Post-''TCG'' banlist, Kashtira found success in "7-Axis", a blind-second control strategy, using Rank 7 monsters and Level 8/10 Synchros (with "[[Effect Veiler]]" or the "[[Yo-kai Girl]]" monsters as the [[tuner]]s). It also synergizes with the [[Adventurer]] engine, as "Kashtira" doesn't need the Normal Summon, and capable of set up the Adventurer engine via "[[Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack]]" and "[[Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss]]". Meanwhile "[[Wandering Gryphon Rider]]" and "[[Illegal Knight]] are both Level 7 monsters to use for Rank 7 plays.

  Both "Fenrir" and "Unicorn" can be used as a generic engine. "Fenrir" acts as powerful interruption going first or second, and can search itself (if nothing else) to use as discard fodder. "Unicorn" can search "Kashtira Birth" for recursion and to Normal Summon any Level 7 monster.

  | opening = "[[Kashtira Unicorn]]" and no monsters on your field
  | end     = "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]" (with one [[Main Monster Zone]] or [[Spell & Trap Zone]] unusable) + "[[Kashtira Arise-Heart]]" ( + "[[Kashtira Fenrir]]" or "Kashtira Unicorn")
  | steps   = 
  # Special Summon "Kashtira Unicorn" from the hand.
  # Activate the effect of "Unicorn" to add "[[Kashtiratheosis]]".
  # Activate "Kashtiratheosis" by targeting "Unicorn" to Special Summon "Kashtira Fenrir" from the Deck.
  # Activate the effect of "Fenrir" to add "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]".
  # Use "Fenrir" and "Unicorn" as [[Xyz Material]]s to [[Xyz Summon]] "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]". Order-wise, this step is interchangeable with the following step.
  # Activate the effect of "Riseheart" to Special Summon itself from the hand. Order-wise, this step is interchangeable with the previous step.
  # Activate the effect of "Riseheart" by banishing "[[Kashtira Big Bang]]", banishing the top 3 cards from your opponent's Deck face-down.
  # Activate the effects of "Shangri-Ira" and the banished "Big Bang" by targeting "Shangri-Ira" in a Chain; for the latter, add either "Fenrir" or "Unicorn" that is a material of "Shangri-Ira" to the hand then Special Summon it to the field.
  # Xyz Summon "[[Kashtira Arise-Heart]]" by using "Riseheart" as the sole material. Alternatively, "Riseheart" and the other "Kashtira" monster can be used to Xyz Summon another "Kashtira Shangi-Ira", then that newly Summoned "Shangri-Ira" can be used as the sole material to Xyz Summon "Arise-Heart" with 3 materials, enabling its Quick Effect to be activated as soon as it is Summoned (as opposed to the other method which leaves "Arise-Heart" with only 1 material).

  === Weakness ===
  * "Kashtira" decks rely heavily on [[banish]]ing cards to make their plays, so anti-banishing floodgates like "[[Imperial Iron Wall]]" and "[[Chaos Hunter]]" can disable most of the main plays. "Chaos Hunter" in particular is especially dangerous in a [[Mirror Match]] due to its floodgate effect are one-sided and can also be easily summoned by the opponent's "Kashtira" cards.
  * As the deck can Special Summon multiple times per turn, "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" is a great threat to the deck; none of their monsters can negate or are protected against "Nibiru". If a Kashtira player suspects their opponent has "Nibiru", they will most likely only end on a single "Arise-Heart".
  * In a dedicated zone lock strategy, any non-destruction removal effect or cards that can force the opponent's monster [[face-down]], such as that of "[[Book of Moon]]", "[[Book of Eclipse]]" or "[[Compulsory Evacuation Device]]" can easily take care of "[[Kashtira Shangri-Ira]]". Similarly, "[[Kaiju]]" and similar monsters can also remove "Shangri-Ira" from the field and bypass its protection effect.
  * "Kashtira" monsters either require no monsters on your field (in the case of the three main U.F.O monsters) or already having a monster on field (in the case of "[[Kashtira Riseheart]]"). Therefore, against a "pure" version of the Deck, summoning a monster to their side of the field - such as with "[[Mushroom Man 2]]" and "[[Ojama Duo]]" - can disable plays unless they have "[[Kashtira Birth]]" in hand. 
  ** In addition, if you opened your hand with multiple "U.F.O Kashtira", there will often be a dead card unless you have "Kashtira Birth" or "[[Kashtira Preparations]]" on the field.
  * Since the deck consists of monsters of multiple [[Attribute]]s, "[[Gozen Match]]" can also shut down a "Kashtira" deck from Summoning more monsters.
  * "Kashtira Shangri-Ira" will most likely be activated in the opponent's Standby Phase, while "Arise-Heart's" attach effect is mandatory. This makes them targets for "[[Triple Tactics Thrust]]", and in "Arise-Heart's" case, "[[Triple Tactics Talent]]" (with the former also capable of searching the latter).
  ** Even if the "Kashtira" user uses the Quick Effect of "Arise-Heart" to banish itself in response to "Talents" (which removes its threat regardless), the other "Kashtira" monsters are still useful for the opponent to steal (e.g. taking control of "Shangri-Ira" then using it as material for a [[Link Summon]] or even Xyz Summoning another "Arise-Heart" using "Shangri-Ira", will free up their own blocked zones).
