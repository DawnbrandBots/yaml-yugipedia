  "'''sphinx'''" (スフィンクス ''Sufinkusu'') is an [[archetype]] of cards consisting of [[Beast]] and [[Rock]] [[Monster Card|monsters]]. The Beast monsters were used by [[Anubis]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! the Movie: Pyramid of Light]]''.

  ==Design==
  They are based on [[wikipedia:Sphinx|sphinxes]], mythical creatures with the head of a certain creature and the body of a lion.

  ==Playstyle==
  ===Beasts===
  The first group consists of [[LIGHT]] [[Beast]] monsters, which were released in ''[[Exclusive Pack]]'' alongside ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light]]''. These are "[[Andro Sphinx]]", "[[Sphinx Teleia]]" and "[[Theinen the Great Sphinx]]", and are related to the "[[Pyramid of Light]]".

  When "[[Pyramid of Light]]" is on the field, "Andro Sphinx" and "Sphinx Teleia" can be Special Summoned at the [[cost]] of 500 Life Points, but can't attack that turn. If Pyramid of Light is destroyed, it destroys both "Andro Sphinx" and "Sphinx Teleia"; if this is [[Missing the Timing|the last thing to happen in the Chain]], this will fulfill the summon requirement of "Theinen the Great Sphinx".

  While these three monsters were powerful beatsticks for the time, they suffered from a few key issues:
  * Consistency: "Pyramid of Light" is useless without a sphinx in hand, while both sphinxes are basically useless without "Pyramid of Light". "Theinen" is always useless to draw.
  * The sphinxes are easy to remove. A lone sphinx on field can be outed by destroying "Pyramid" ''or'' by using any sort of monster removal. 
  ** Even if both sphinxes are on the field, "Theinen's" summon requirement can [[Missing the Timing|miss timing]], and "Pyramid's" destruction effect happens mid-Chain. This means that activating a Spell/Trap removal card like "[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]" as Chain Link 2 (targeting "Pyramid") will end up destroying "Pyramid", "Andro Sphinx", and "Sphinx Teleia" while preventing "Theinen" from being Summoned. "[[Dust Tornado]]'s" "set a Spell/Trap card from hand" can also be used to cause "Theinen" to miss timing.

  === Rocks ===
  The second group consists of [[EARTH]] [[Rock]] monsters. These include "[[Hieracosphinx]]", "[[Criosphinx]]", "[[Guardian Sphinx]]", and the retrain "[[Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx]]". They are mainly used as support for monsters that flip themselves face-down (e.g., "[[Crass Clown]]", "[[Des Lacooda]]", "Guardian Sphinx").

  * "Hieracosphinx" prevents your face-down monsters from being attacked.
  * "Criosphinx", when a monster is returned from opponent's field to hand, forces the opponent to send 1 card from hand to the GY.
  * "Guardian Sphinx" can flip itself face-down, and on Flip Summon, returns all monsters from Deck to hand.
  * "Pharaonic Guardian Sphinx" can flip itself face-down, and on Flip Summon, shuffles all monsters your opponent controls into the Deck.
  * "[[Exxod, Master of The Guard]]" is not a "sphinx", but can only be Special Summoned by Tributing a "sphinx", and also has an effect that supports Flip Summoning.

  All of these sphinxes are inherently slow: they require a Tribute to be Normal Summoned, and they support monsters that need to be Flip Summoned for their effects to activate.

  "[[Chronomaly Winged Sphinx]]" and "[[Triamid Sphinx]]" are both EARTH Rock monsters that are technically part of this archetype, but are mainly designed to be played with their respective archetypes ("[[Chronomaly]]" and "[[Triamid]]").
