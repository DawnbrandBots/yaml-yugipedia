  "'''Symphonic Warrior'''", known as "'''Sound Warrior'''" ({{Ruby|音響戦士|サウンドウォリアー}} ''Saundo Woriā'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] of [[WIND]] [[Machine]] [[Monster Card|monsters]], first released in ''[[Storm of Ragnarok]]''. [[Sindy Cross]] used "[[Symphonic Warrior Basses (D Team)|Symphonic Warrior Basses]]" in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! D Team ZEXAL]]'' manga.
  ==Design==
  The "Symphonic Warrior" monsters are mechanic anthropomorphized music equipment, usually played in a rock band. They all have some sort of support effects to change the stats of monsters on the [[field]]. The [[Pendulum Monster]]s have more varied effects that allow the [[swarm]]ing of multiple monsters.

  ==Playing style==
  Each "Symphonic Warrior" monster focuses on changing stats of the cards on the [[field]] to allow for versatile [[Synchro Summon]]s. Potentially any [[Level]], [[Attribute]], [[Type]], or even specifically named [[Monster Card]], the player needs for a Synchro Summon, can be obtained by using the support effects of "Symphonic Warrior" monsters.
  "[[Symphonic Warrior Basses]]" can increase the Level of another "Symphonic Warrior" by an amount equal to the number of cards in one's [[hand]]. This can be useful for any Synchro Summon, and makes it ideal for "[[Morphtronic]]" [[Deck]]s due to their general lack of high-Level monsters.
  "[[Symphonic Warrior Drumss]]" can change the Attribute of another "Symphonic Warrior", making it useful for Attribute-oriented Synchro Summons such as "[[Zeman the Ape King]]". This allows it to fit into many different Attribute-based Decks.
  "[[Symphonic Warrior Piaano]]" can change the Type of another "Symphonic Warrior", making it useful for Type-oriented Synchro Summons such as for "[[Stygian Sergeants]]" ([[Fiend]]) or "[[Trident Dragion]]" ([[Dragon]]). This also allows it to fit into a Deck focused on a Type without many [[Tuner monster]]s, such as [[Zombie]].
  "[[Symphonic Warrior Guitaar]]" can [[Special Summon]] "Symphonic Warrior" monsters from the Deck or [[Graveyard]], making it easier to get a Tuner and non-Tuner monster onto the field.
  "[[Symphonic Warrior Synthess]]" adds a "Symphonic Warrior" from the Deck to the hand when [[flip]]ped [[face-up]] (other than itself), and can [[banish]] itself from the Graveyard to Special Summon a banished "Symphonic Warrior" (again, excluding itself). In addition, once per turn, it can copy the effect and name of another "Symphonic Warrior" monster the player controls or has in their Graveyard, for added versatility.
  "[[Symphonic Warrior Miccs]]" not only compliments "Guitaars" as a [[Pendulum Scale]], but also allows for faster play of the "Symphonic Warrior" monsters. While in the [[Pendulum Zone]], it can recycle banished "Symphonic Warriors", but when it is [[Summon]]ed, either by its own effect, a [[Normal Summon]], or a Special Summon such as a [[Pendulum Summon]], it gives the player an additional Normal Summon or [[Set]], greatly increasing the number of plays they can make, especially since it is a Level 5 [[Pendulum Monster]] that can easily be recycled for powerful Synchro Summons.
  "[[Symph Amplifire]]", the new [[Field Spell Card]], rewards the player with [[Symphonic Counter]]s for activating the effects of "Symphonic Warrior" monsters: all "Symphonic Warrior" monsters gain 100 [[ATK]] per [[counter]], and counters can be removed to inflict [[damage]] or banish the opponent's cards.

  ==Trivia==
  * The original 3 "Symphonic Warrior" monsters can be related to Konami Arcade Games ''Keyboardmania'' ("[[Symphonic Warrior Piaano|Piaano]]"), ''Guitar Freaks'' ("[[Symphonic Warrior Basses|Basses]]"), and ''Drummania'' ("[[Symphonic Warrior Drumss|Drumss]]").
  * The fact that the first "Symphonic Warrior" monsters were [[Tuner monster]]s may be a reference to [[wikipedia:Musical tuning|musical tuning]].
