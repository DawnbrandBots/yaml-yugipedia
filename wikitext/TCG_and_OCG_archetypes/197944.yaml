  "'''Atlantean'''", known as  "'''Sea Emperor'''" ({{Ruby|海|かい}}{{Ruby|皇|おう}} ''Kaiō'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] of [[WATER]] [[Sea Serpent]] monsters. They were first introduced in ''[[Phantom Darkness]]'', with "[[Atlantean Pikeman]]". They later gained more members in ''[[Return of the Duelist]]'', ''[[Realm of the Sea Emperor Structure Deck]]'', which also introduced their first support card, "[[Atlantean Marksman]]", and ''[[Lord of the Tachyon  Galaxy]]'' which introduced "[[Legendary Atlantean Tridon]]".

  == Story ==
  {{See also|[[Gagaga Academy Tospedia card storylines#"The Mermails and Atlanteans" Edition|Gagaga Academy Tospedia card storylines]]}}
  In an attempt to conquer both sea and land of their region, the "Atlanteans", led by their Emperor, "Poseidra", began an attack on the tropical island of the "[[Fire King]]s". However, they resisted the attacks, dragging the war to a standstill. As a way to win their battle, the "Atlanteans" sought the "[[Mermail]]s", who had lost their home. Using the power of their sealed treasure, the [[Abyss-squall|Golden Ring]] that could control the weather, "Poseidra" once again began an attack against the "Fire Kings", but this time, using the military power of the "Mermails".
  They also have a rivalry against the "[[Phantasm Spiral]]" archetype.

  == Playing Style ==
  The "Atlantean" archetype is broadly focused on [[swarm]]ing the field to Summon several different [[WATER]] boss monsters, such as "[[Mermail King - Neptabyss]]", "[[Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord]]", "[[Mermail Abyssgaios]]", and their archetypal boss monster, "[[Poseidra Abyss, the Atlantean Dragon Lord]]". It is also focused on [[Trigger Effect]]s that activate when an "Atlantean" monster is sent to the GY to activate a WATER monster's effect, i.e. as a [[cost]].

  The five key "Atlantean" monsters are "[[Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince]]", "[[Atlantean Dragoons]]", "[[Mermail Shadow Squad]]" (which is always treated as an "Atlantean" card), "[[Atlantean Heavy Infantry]]", and "[[Atlantean Marksman]]". Each has two effects, with the second being a [[Trigger Effect]] that shares the condition: ''"If this card is sent to the Graveyard to activate a WATER monster's effect: [Effect]"''

  |}

  Any WATER monster effect [[cost]] that can send an "Atlantean" to the GY can trigger its Trigger Effect. These include:
  * Discarded or sent from the hand to the GY (e.g.: "[[Mermail Abyssteus]]", "[[Brionac, Dragon of the Ice Barrier]]")
  * Tributed or sent from the field to the GY (e.g.: "[[Mermail Abyssmegalo]]", "[[Abyssrhine, the Atlantean Spirit]]")
  * Sent from the Deck to the GY (e.g.: "[[Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince]]", "[[Genex Undine]]", "[[Deep Sea]]" monsters)
  * Detached from an Xyz Monster as a material (e.g. "[[Bahamut Shark]]", "[[Mermail Abyssgaios]]")

  In addition to having a Trigger Effect, "[[Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince]]" is also an in-archetype "activator" with a cost that can send an "Atlantean" to the GY: by sending 1 "Atlantean" monster from the Deck to the GY as a cost, "Neptabyss" can search 1 "Atlantean" card. This makes it the Deck's key starter and searcher.

  When the archetype was first released, game plans initially ended with the summoning of its boss monster "[[Poseidra, the Atlantean Dragon]]", which has since become obsolete as the game's power level increased. Instead the archetype was historically more commonly used in conjunction with the "[[Mermail]]" archetype, which it has great synergy with. Because many "Mermail" effects discard a WATER monster as cost, the "Atlantean" trigger effects can be used to offset these costs, providing further card advantage for more combos. ''[[Rage of the Abyss]]'' included a new wave of cards that explicitly support both Mermails and Atlanteans, such as "[[Abyssrhine, the Atlantean Spirit]]" and "[[Mermail King - Neptabyss]]".

  === Sample combos ===
  "[[Neptabyss, the Atlantean Prince]]" is the Deck's main starter. One such combo it enables can end on a board with multiple forms of disruption, as well as more forms of generating advantage, even under a restriction of Summoning only WATER monsters. The combo aims to:
  # Summon 2 copies of "[[Toadally Awesome]]", the first as the player's 5th Summon, which both prevents an opponent's "[[Nibiru, the Primal Being]]" from ending the combo, as well as negating any 2 cards or effect activations during their turn.
  # Use "[[Moulinglacia the Elemental Lord]]" to discard 2 of the opponent's cards, and use it as Xyz Material to prevent it from skipping the player's next [[Battle Phase]].
  # Create followup with "[[Mermail Abyssalacia]]" on the field and "[[Abyss-team]]" in the GY, the former having effects to search and float by using WATER monsters as cost, and the latter being able to recycle any "Mermail" monster from the GY or banishment.
  # Setup ways to destroy the opponent's cards with "[[Atlantean Heavy Infantry]]" in hand and a Set "[[Virtue Stream]]", as well as returning them to the hand by reviving "[[Poseidra, the Rumbling Atlantean]]" with "Neptabyss" during the opponent's turn.
  # Summon "[[Mermail King - Neptabyss]]", which can equip "[[Abyss-scale of the Mizuchi]]" (or any other "[[Abyss-]]" Equip Spell) to itself, while also protecting "Abyssalacia" and the two copies of "Toadally Awesome" from being targeted.
  # Equipping "Abyss-scale of the Mizuchi", which negates the opponent's Spells at resolution, protecting the board even against cards such as "[[Dark Ruler No More]]".
  # Placing "[[Abyssrhine, the Atlantean Spirit]]" in the GY, which can both draw 1 card, and trigger the effect of an "Atlantean" monster in hand and "Mermail King - Neptabyss" to re-equip "Mizuchi" to itself.
  # Draw at least 2 cards with "[[Abyss-team]]".
