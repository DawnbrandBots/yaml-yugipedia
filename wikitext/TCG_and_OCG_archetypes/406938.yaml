  "'''Destruction Sword'''" ({{Ruby|破|は}}{{Ruby|壊|かい}}{{Ruby|剣|けん}}, ''Hakaiken'') is an [[archetype]] debuting in ''[[Breakers of Shadow]]''. It is connected to the "[[Buster Blader (archetype)|Buster Blader]]" archetype.
  The "Buster Destruction Sword" monsters in this archetype can be [[equip]]ped from your [[hand]] or side of the [[field]] to a "Buster Blader" monster you control. Each of these monsters' [[Attribute]] is [[DARK]] and have both an [[ATK]] equal to 400 x their [[Level]] and a [[DEF]] equal to 300 x their Level. Each of these cards depicts "[[Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman]]" holding a different Destruction Sword.

  == Lore ==
  Most of the "Destruction Sword" archetype and its related cards tell a short episode about the relationship between "[[Buster Blader, the Destruction Swordmaster]]" and the "[[Buster Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman]]". In it, the [[retrained]] "Buster Blader, the Destruction Swordmaster" appears and not the original "Buster Blader" card, as shown by the differences in their armor. As seen in "[[Prologue of the Destruction Swordsman]]", Buster Blader and Buster Whelp met when Buster Blader either rescued or stole Buster Whelp from a larger dragon that's suggested to be its parent.
  Each of the "Buster Destruction Swords" show "Buster Whelp" growing bigger and slowly more vicious, in addition to holding different "Destruction Swords".
  In the artwork of "[[Dragon Buster Destruction Sword|Dragon Buster]]", "Buster Whelp" has simply grown more mature; in the artwork of "Wizard Buster" it is shown to be drowning in dark sludge; and in the artwork of "Robot Buster" it looks plain vicious, eventually becoming "[[Buster Dragon]]".
  While the reason behind this transformation or corruption is not explained, the artwork of "[[Karma of the Destruction Swordsman]]" features "Buster Blader" confronting "Buster Dragon" with tearful sorrow. "[[Destruction Swordsman Fusion]]" shows "Buster Blader", having slain "Buster Dragon", now embracing his former companion's dead body with the "Dragon Buster Destruction Sword" resting in the ground. "[[Destruction Sword Memories]]" reflects a good memory of "Buster Blader" and "Buster Whelp", showing their bond while raindrops slide down it. This is the moment the two fuse into "[[Buster Blader, the Dragon Destroyer Swordsman]]", with Buster Blader donning a new magical armor forged from Buster Dragon's remains and Buster Whelp inhabiting the armor itself as "[[Protector Whelp of the Destruction Swordsman]]". "[[Destruction Sword Flash]]" features the [[Attack name|attack]] of "Dragon Destroyer".
