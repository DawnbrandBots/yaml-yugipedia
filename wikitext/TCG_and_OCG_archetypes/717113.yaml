  "'''Therion'''", known in the ''[[OCG]]'' as "'''Therions'''" (セリオンズ ''Serionzu''), is an [[archetype]] introduced in ''[[Dimension Force]]''.

  ==Etymology==
  ''Thēríon'' (θηρίον) is the Greek word for "wild animal" or "beast". It refers to the archetype's theme of the [[wikipedia:Zodiac|western zodiac]]. The English word "zodiac" is derived from the Greek term ''zōidiakòs kýklos'' (ζῳδιακός κύκλος; lit. "circle of little animals"), which reflects the prominence of animals among the [[wikipedia:Astrological sign|twelve signs]].

  The meaning of ''zōidiakòs kýklos'' ("circle of little animals") may also be an origin for the archetype's gladiatorial theme. Furthermore, the center of "[[Therion Discolosseum]]" is a spoked wheel, an image used to represent the zodiac.

  The "Therion" members are named after stars that belong to the various [[wikipedia:Zodiac#Constellations|constellations of the western zodiac]].

  However, "[[Therion "Empress" Alasia]]" is instead named after a star from the constellation [[wikipedia:Serpens|Serpens]]. Serpens is the serpent held by [[wikipedia:Ophiuchus|Ophiuchus]], one of the thirteen constellations that cross the ecliptic (for this reason, [[wikipedia:Ophiuchus (astrology)|Ophiuchus]] is suggested to be the 13th sign of the zodiac).

  "[[Springans Captain Sargas]]" follows the same zodiac theme as the "Therion" monsters. It represents the [[wikipedia:Zodiac|zodiac]] [[wikipedia:Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], and it is named after the star [[wikipedia:Theta Scorpii|Sargas (θ Scorpii)]].

  The related "[[Spright]]" archetype also shares the same zodiac theme, encompassing most of the remaining astrological signs unused by the "Therion" archetype.

  ==Playing style==
  The "Therion" archetype revolves around Special Summoning high-[[Level]] monsters of various [[Type]]s from the hand by equipping them with monsters from the GY. When equipped, each "Therion" monster confers its effect to the equipper. The archetype also revolves around interactions specifying "[[Endless Engine Argyro System]]", who itself is an archetype-specific "[[Foolish Burial]]".

  Each "Therion" monster, except "[[Therion Irregular]]", shares the following effects:
  * From hand, they can be Special Summoned by targeting a "Therion" monster, or a monster of their respective type, from the Graveyard, then [[equip]]ping the target.
  * On field, they have some effect to provide removal negation, searching, or protection. These effects have some sort of cost (usually sending a card from hand/field to the GY) or other sort of negative effect.
  * When equipped to a "Therion" monster, it grants the equipper 700 ATK, and allows the equipper to use the equipped monster's on-field effect. This specifies that the equipper "Therion" can activate the granted effect as if it had the name of the equipped "Therion", meaning that any hard [[once per turn]] restrictions are shared.

  "[[Therion Irregular]]" can be Special Summoned from hand by equipping 3 "Therion" monsters. On field, it has a board wipe as its individual effect. When equipped, it can Special Summon itself and equip the monster it was equipped to. 

  "Therion" monsters are also supported by a series of [[Spell]]s and [[Trap Card]]s that allow setting up the GY for further plays. "[[Endless Engine Argyro System]]" can send 1 "Therion" monster from the [[Deck]] to the GY, immediately setting up the Summons of "Therion" monsters in the player's hand. In the GY, "Argyro System" can recycle another "Therion" card for reuse, but not in the same turn it's sent to the GY. "[[Therion Discolosseum]]" searches a "Therion" on activation and provides battle protection (that also indirectly searches "Therion" monsters by milling them to GY as battle protection) and battle-based recovery. "[[Therion Charge]]" is an archetypal "[[Trade-In]]" that cycles cards and sets up the GY.

  For Traps, "[[Therion Cross]]" is a monster negate/banish disruption, and "[[Therion Stand Up!]]" is a monster revival with a GY effect to equip another "Therion" monster from GY.

  As a GY focused Deck, the "Therion" archetype benefits from milling-based engines to set up the GY, such as "[[P.U.N.K.]]" or "[[Ogdoadic]]"-based "[[Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon|Chaos Ruler]]" / "[[The Zombie Vampire]]" milling combos. Alternatively, the Deck can focus on using a "[[Lonefire Blossom]]" and "[[Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio]]"-based Plant engine to turbo out "Lily" Borea for consistent searches.

  Individual "Therion" monsters can also be splashed into other typing-based Decks as extenders or boss monsters, in particular Plants and Machines via "Lily" Borea and "King" Regulus.
