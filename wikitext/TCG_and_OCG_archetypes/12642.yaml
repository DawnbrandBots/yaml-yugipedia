  "'''Neo-Spacian'''" ({{Ruby|Ｎ|ネオスペーシアン}} ''Neosupēshian'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Monster Card|monsters]] related to the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype which focuses on [[Contact Fusion]] with "[[Elemental HERO Neos]]". In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime, the "Neo-Spacian" monsters, along with their infant "[[Chrysalis]]" forms, were introduced by [[Jaden Yuki]], who created the concept of these cards when he was a little boy. There are six [[Level]] 3 "Neo-Spacian" monsters, each with a different [[Attribute]] and [[Type]]. This archetype relies on "Elemental HERO Neos" and was designed to give Jaden an alternate strategy to his "Elemental HERO" monsters.
  While the Japanese name of "[[NEX]]" would make it appear to be a member of the archetype, it is not considered a "Neo-Spacian" card due to "different superscripting".<ref>https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/faq_search.action?ope=4&cid=7162&request_locale=ja</ref> Similarly, the "Neo-Spacian" monsters themselves are not to be considered as "[[Neos]]" cards according to a ruling for "[[Elemental HERO Divine Neos]]".

  == Playing style ==
  [[File:Neos Contact in Teardrop.png|250px|right|thumb|The "[[Neos]]" [[Contact Fusion]] monsters.]]

  The general playstyle of "[[Neos]]" and "Neo-Spacian" is to facilitate the Special Summons of a variety of powerful Fusion Monsters, much like "[[Elemental HERO]]" (and "[[HERO]]" as a whole). This is commonly done with the plethora of cards which specifically support "[[Elemental HERO Neos]]" and "Neo-Spacian" monsters, which culminates into a playstyle that differs from the rest of the "Elemental HERO" archetype.

  The "Neo-Spacian" monsters themselves do not have particularly powerful ATK/DEF or useful effects, but there are notable exceptions in the modern game. These are:

  * "[[Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin]]", which can help the player gain information on the opponent's hand, but also potentially get rid of a combo starter or a problematic [[hand trap]], bait out the activations of such effects of the latter
  * "[[Neo-Spacian Grand Mole]]", which can return troublesome monsters and itself to the hand by battling them.
  * "[[Neo-Spacian Dark Panther]]", which can stituationally copy an opponent's monster name and its effects.

  A couple of them ("Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin" and "[[Neo-Spacian Glow Moss]]") can be [[Card evolutions|upgraded]] with "[[NEX]]" ("[[Neo-Spacian Marine Dolphin]]" and "[[Neo-Spacian Twinkle Moss]]").

  "Neo-Spacian" is also supported by the "[[Chrysalis]]" archetype, having a "Chrysalis" monster for each corresponding "Neo-Spacian" monster and can benefit from "[[Cocoon Party]]", "[[Contact]]" and "[[Cocoon Rebirth]]" to use "Chrysalis" monsters to Summon out their corresponding "Neo-Spacian" counterparts.

  Unlike most [[Fusion Monster]]s, which must be [[Fusion Summon]]ed, most "Neos" Fusion Monsters are instead Summoned via [[Contact Fusion]], which requires [[shuffling]] the [[Fusion Material]]s on the [[field]] into the [[Deck]] to [[Special Summon]] them. However, the "Neos" Fusion Monsters also have a mandatory effect that returns themselves from the field to the [[Extra Deck]] during the [[End Phase]]. To avoid this, the [[Field Spell Card|Field Spell]] "[[Neo Space]]" and the [[Equip Spell Card|Equip Spell]] "[[Instant Neo Space]]" makes this effect no longer mandatory to activate, allowing the Fusion Monsters to stay on the field as long as either card is present (as well as allowing the Special Summon of "Elemental HERO Neos" when the equipped monster [[leaves the field]]).

  The two-material "Neos" Contact Fusion Monsters ("[[Elemental HERO Air Neos|Air Neos]]", "[[Elemental HERO Aqua Neos|Aqua Neos]]", "[[Elemental HERO Dark Neos|Dark Neos]]", "[[Elemental HERO Flare Neos|Flare Neos]]", "[[Elemental HERO Glow Neos|Glow Neos]]", "[[Elemental HERO Grand Neos|Grand Neos]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Marine Neos|Marine Neos]]") have effects based on their respective "Neo-Spacian" material's effect. The three and four-material "Neos" Contact Fusion Monsters ("[[Elemental HERO Chaos Neos|Chaos Neos]]", "[[Elemental HERO Magma Neos|Magma Neos]]", "[[Elemental HERO Nebula Neos|Nebula Neos]]", "[[Elemental HERO Storm Neos|Storm Neos]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Cosmo Neos|Cosmo Neos]]") generally have more powerful effects, and while they still have their mandatory effects of shuffling themselves back into the Extra Deck, these shared effects can also clear both players' fields (or only the opponent's field in the case of "Cosmo Neos") to varying extents, making these effects situationally beneficial.

  Due to the nature of Contact Fusion, the [[Deck]] must use numerous ways to [[swarm]] the field with "Elemental HERO Neos" and "Neo-Spacian" monsters. "[[Neo Space Connector]]" is essential to this Deck's playstyle as it serves as a one-card "Neos" Contact Fusion; it can Summon "Elemental HERO Neos" or a "Neo-Spacian" monster from the [[hand]] or Deck upon its [[Normal Summon]] and then it can [[Tribute]] itself to Summon another material from the [[GY]]. "Elemental HERO Neos" and "Neo-Spacian" monsters are also bolstered by many support cards that such as "[[NEXT]]", "[[Contact Gate]]", "[[EN Shuffle]]", "[[Cross Keeper]]", "[[EN - Engage Neo Space]]" and "[[EN Wave]]".

  Rather than Summoning the [[material]]s onto the field for Contact Fusion, "[[Miracle Contact]]" can return materials from the player's hand, field, or GY to the deck to Special Summon "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monsters that mention "Elemental HERO Neos" as material (though it does not properly Summon the monster). As a [[Normal Trap Card|Normal Trap]], "[[Favorite Contact]]" can also be used to Special Summon a Fusion Monster that mentions a "HERO" monster as a material by returning monsters to the Deck from almost every other location similarly to "Miracle Contact" (including the user's [[banish]]ment), though it prevents that Fusion Monster from being returned to the Extra Deck if "Elemental HERO Neos" was returned, making it useful for Summoning the "Neos" Contact Fusion without worrying about its mandatory effect of shuffling itself to the Extra Deck. Some of the Summonable monsters can also disrupt the opponent if Summoned via "Favorite Contact" during their turn. In particular, "Cosmo Neos" can lock out the opponent from using a majority of their cards on the turn that it was Summoned from the Extra Deck.

  Most of these effects require filling the GY with "Neo-Spacian" monsters and "Elemental HERO Neos" beforehand. "[[Convert Contact]]" and "EN - Engage Neo Space" are viable solutions for this, sending two monsters while also gaining two cards (draw 2 cards from the former, while the latter Special Summons a Level 5 or higher "Elemental HERO" monster and adds 1 "[[Polymerization]]" from the Deck or GY). "[[Elemental HERO Prisma]]", which can [[send]] "Elemental HERO Neos" or a "Neo-Spacian" monster to the GY and change its name to the one of the sent card can be used for the Summon of a "Neos" Fusion.

  "[[Elemental HERO Spirit of Neos]]" is a key card which can search the vast majority of "Elemental HERO Neos" support cards or "[[Polymerization]]" upon its Special Summon while also tagging itself out for any normal "Elemental HERO" monster from the deck including "Elemental HERO Neos". It can be Special Summoned from the hand by its own effect during the opponent's turn to wall out the opponent's attacks, or "[[Cross Keeper]]", from the Deck with "EN - Engage Neo Space" or "[[EN Shuffle]]". One of the important cards "Spirit of Neos" can search is "[[Instant Contact]]", an "[[Instant Fusion]]"-like card which can cheat out a Level 7 or lower "Elemental HERO" or "Neo-Spacian" monster from the Extra Deck which can easily Summon: the two-material "Neos" Contact Fusions, "[[Neo-Spacian Marine Dolphin]]" (as an easier way to Summon "[[Elemental HERO Marine Neos]]") and other important "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monsters such as "[[Elemental HERO Sunrise]]". Above all else, it functions as a useful extender both within and outside of the "Neos"/"Neo-Spacian" playstyle.

  "[[Neos Fusion]]" is an important card which easily Summons a Fusion Monster that requires two materials including "Elemental HERO Neos" by sending those materials from the field, hand or Deck to the GY (even [[Ignoring the Summoning conditions|ignoring its Summoning conditions]]). This sets up the GY for either reviving materials for Contact Fusions, "Miracle Contact" or "Favorite Contact" in subsequent turns (as the card's activation prevents the player from Special Summoning for the rest of that turn). It can then banish itself from the GY to act as a one-time protection for "Neos" Fusion Monsters from destruction, as well as preventing "Neos" Fusion monsters from being shuffled into the Extra Deck by their own effect if "Neo Space" or "Instant Neo Space" is not on the field. This cards greatly supports easier access to the two-material "Neos" Contact Fusion Monsters, as well as most of the aformenetioned "Neos" Fusion Monsters that must be Fusion Summoned, and protecting said monsters. Other Decks can make use of "Neos Fusion" to Summon "Brave Neos" similarly to a "[[Foolish Burial]]" for Level 4 or lower Effect Monsters to make use of their GY effects later.

  Over time, later support for the "Neo-Spacian"/"Neos" playstyle started to focus more on the traditional Fusion Summon playstyle that the other "Elemental HERO" monsters (and "HERO") are notable for, integrating the two themes' playstyles together more easily. As such, the remaining "Neos" Fusion Monsters are required to be Fusion Summoned instead of Contact Fusion:

  * "[[Elemental HERO Divine Neos]]" is difficult to Summon due to its Fusion Material requirements, though it can banish a "Neos", "Neo-Spacian" or "HERO" monster to permanently gain ATK and temporarily copy the banished monster's effect.
  * "[[Elemental HERO Neos Knight]]" is a formiddable beatstick that can attack twice although it cannot deal battle damage.
  * "[[Elemental HERO Brave Neos]]" is a very flexible "Neos" Fusion Monster with a variety of useful effects whilst being easy to Summon, only requiring a [[Level]] 4 or lower [[Effect Monster]] and "Elemental HERO Neos". Also, it also does not have an effect to shuffle itself back into the Extra Deck, thereby not requiring "Neo Space" or "Instant Neo Space" to keep it on the field. Furthermore, if "Brave Neos" destroys a monster by battle, it can search for an "Elemental HERO Neos" support card.
  * "[[Elemental HERO Shining Neos Wingman]]" can destroy the opponent's cards on the field upon Summon whilst having destruction protection effects. One of its commonly used materials, "[[Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage]]", can search "Favorite Contact" which can Special Summon "Shining Neos Wingman" during the opponent's turn to disrupt their plays.
  * "[[Elemental HERO Neos Kluger]]" can float into "[[Neos Wiseman]]" upon destruction, which can be used for strategic OTKs.
  * "[[Rainbow Neos]]" boasts a 4500 ATK beatstick which can clear the opponent's field or GY.
  * "[[Armed Neos]]" can destroy multiple monsters upon its Summon, then Tribute itself to cheat out an "Elemental HERO" Fusion Monster during the opponent's turn if it destroyed an opponent's monster by battle on the previous turn.
  * "[[Evil HERO Neos Lord]]" will require "Neos Fusion" or "Favorite Contact" to be Special Summoned (if neither "[[Dark Fusion]]" or "[[Dark Contact]]" is run), though its effects to gain control of opposing monsters and its passive immunity from battle and effect destruction are more useful in comparison to most other "Neos" Fusions.

  === Other additions ===
  To alleviate the need of specific materials that "Neos" Fusion Monsters requires, the Deck can make use of "[[Keeper of Dragon Magic]]" (for searching out the required "Fusion" [[Spell Cards|Spells]], Summoning needed materials from the GY for Contact Fusions while also being a valid material for "Brave Neos") and "[[Fusion Deployment]]" or "[[Fusion Draft]]" (which can Summon or search any needed materials for "Neos" Contact Fusions respectively while also being [[search]]able by "Keeper of Dragon Magic"). Decks that can Summon multiple "HERO" monsters onto the field, such as the "[[Vision HERO]]" engine of "[[Vision HERO Faris|Faris]]", "[[Vision HERO Increase|Increase]]", and "[[Vision HERO Vyon|Vyon]]", can utilize "[[Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer]]" to search out "Elemental HERO Neos" and/or "Neo-Spacian" monsters to have them in hand or in the GY (such as after using them for a Fusion Summon of a monster such as "Brave Neos") in preparation for "Miracle Contact" or "Favorite Contact". However, a few cards that support the "Neo-Spacian"/"Neos" playstyle ("EN - Engage Neo Space", "Fusion Duplication", "Keeper of Dragon Magic" etc.) prevents the player from Special Summoning non-Fusion Monsters from the Extra Deck for the entire turn, completely restricting the [[Link Monster]] strategies such as the aformentioned "Infernal Devicer"). Likewise, the effect of "Infernal Devicer" prevents the player from Special Summoning non-"HERO" monsters for the turn (thus preventing the Contact Fusion playstyle) while "Fusion Draft" only restricts Special Summons of non-Fusion Monsters for the rest of the turn as part of its effect resolution, so the player will have to choose one group of strategies and decide their plays accordingly.

  As all Main Deck "Neo-Spacian" monsters are Level 3 and have completely different ATK/DEF values, Types and Attributes, while only "[[Neo-Spacian Dark Panther]]" and "[[Neo-Spacian Flare Scarab]]" have the same DEF, any Deck playing a heavy amount of "Neo-Spacian" monsters is capable of using "[[Small World]]" to search any of their key monsters, such as "Neo Space Connector" or "Keeper of Dragon Magic".

  On the other side of the relationship, the typical competitive "HERO" deck now typically runs a small "Neos" package that includes "Elemental HERO Neos", "Elemental HERO Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage", "Elemental HERO Shining Neos Wingman" and "Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer". Part of the "HERO" strategy now includes Link Summoning "Xtra HERO Infernal Devicer" and use its effect to reveal "Shining Neos Wingman" and add "Elemental HERO Neos". "Polymerization" is then used to Fusion Summon "Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage" using "Elemental HERO Neos" and another "Elemental HERO" ("[[Elemental HERO Stratos|Stratos]]" or "[[Elemental HERO Liquid Soldier|Liquid Soldier]]"). Upon its Summon, "Flame Wingman - Infernal Rage" will add "Favorite Contact" from the Deck or GY to the hand, therefore setting up the Special Summon of "Shining Neos Wingman" during the opponent's turn to disrupt their plays by destroying their cards upon its Special Summon. 

  If one also includes "[[Evil HERO Infernal Rider]]", "[[Super Polymerization]]" and "Evil HERO Neos Lord", they can also further disrupt the opponent with "Infernal Rider" Setting "Super Polymerization" from the Deck (which allows "Evil HERO" Fusion Monsters to be Fusion Summoned with effects other than "Dark Fusion". After the effect of "Shining Neos Wingman" is used, "Super Polymerization" can fuse "Shining Neos Wingman" with another Effect Monster on the opponent's field, then be able to take control of one of their monsters per turn.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * The majority of all "Neos" [[Contact Fusion|Contact]] [[Fusion Monster]]s having to shuffle themselves into the [[Extra Deck]] during the [[End Phase]] leaves the user wide open for the opponent, making almost all of these monsters not very useful to Summon when going first (the main exceptions being "[[Elemental HERO Aqua Neos]]" and "[[Elemental HERO Marine Neos]]"). Overall, the "Neos" Contact Fusion Monsters are mostly underwhelming in the current power level of the game due to the setup required for Contact Fusion (or Summoning them by other methods) compared to the traditional [[Fusion Summon]] playstyle of the rest of the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype (and "[[HERO]]" in general).
  * Like "Elemental HERO", "[[Gozen Match]]" can significantly disrupt "Neo-Spacian"/"Neos" Decks due to their variety of [[Attribute]]s. Meanwhile, "[[Rivalry of Warlords]]" can also pose a threat to the deck's Contact Fusion playstyle since all "Neo-Spacian" monsters have different monster [[Type]]s from each other and from most "Elemental HERO" monsters used in the strategy (sans "[[Neo-Spacian Aqua Dolphin]]").
  * "Neos"/"Neo-Spacian" Decks are still susceptible to "[[Dimensional Barrier]]", preventing their Fusion Monsters from being Summoned at all.
