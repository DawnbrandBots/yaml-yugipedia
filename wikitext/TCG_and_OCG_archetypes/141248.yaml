  '''Simorgh''' (シムルグ ''Shimurugu'') is an [[archetype]] of [[DARK]] and [[WIND]] [[Winged Beast]] monsters with a focus on [[Normal Summon]]ing Winged Beast monsters and countering the opponent's use of Spells and Traps.  It debuted in ''[[Structure Deck: Lord of the Storm]]'', but did not receive its first support until ''[[Rising Rampage]]''.
  ==Etymology==
  The name "Simorgh" comes from the bird of legend known as [[wikipedia:Simurgh|Simurgh]], a benevolent deity from Persian mythology. "[[Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh]]" is named after [[wikipedia:Alborz|Alborz]], a mountain range in northern Iran.
  ==Playing style==
  "Simorgh" cards focus heavily on [[Normal Summon]]ing, [[Tribute Summon]]ing, and removal of the opponent's [[Spell]]/[[Trap Card]]s. All low-[[Level]] "Simorgh" monsters have an effect that activates only when Normal Summoned, either getting cards out of the [[Deck]] or, in the case of "[[Simorgh, Bird of Beginning]]", giving the player another Normal Summon. When combined with "[[Elborz, the Sacred Lands of Simorgh]]", which also grants an extra Normal Summon, a "Simorgh" Deck can feasibly Normal Summon three times in one turn. Both "Elborz" and "[[Simorgh, Bird of Ancestry]]" reduce the number of [[Tribute]]s of their monsters ([[Winged Beast]] or [[WIND]], respectively) to single-Tribute, making the Summoning of their stronger monsters far easier, especially as every low-Level "Simorgh" can Special Summon themselves from the [[Graveyard]] if the opponent controls no Spells or Traps.
  Once the high-Level "Simorgh" monsters are finally on the [[field]], their goal from there is to wreak havoc on the opponent's Spell and Trap Cards.  "[[Simorgh Repulsion]]" in particular immediately wipes their backrow clean for the cost of a single Winged Beast monster [[discard]] (which, as mentioned, the low-Levels can then capitalize on by immediately reviving themselves). Most high-Level "Simorgh" cards also have an effect that discourages the opponent's use of Spells/Traps, either via negation or further card removal, while the original "[[Simorgh, Bird of Divinity]]" preys on their lack of a backrow.
