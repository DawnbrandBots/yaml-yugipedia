  "'''Masked HERO'''" ({{Ruby|Ｍ・ＨＥＲＯ|マスクドヒーロー}} ''Masukudo Hīrō'' in Japan, written as {{Ruby|Ｍ|マスクド}}・{{Ruby|ＨＥＲＯ|ヒーロー}} or {{Ruby|Ｍ|マスクド}}・{{Ruby|Ｈ|ヒーロー}} in the Japanese manga) is a "[[HERO]]" sub-[[archetype]] used by [[Jaden Yuki (manga)|Jaden Yuki]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (manga)|''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' manga]]. Jaden started using this archetype after the tournament to [[Duel]] the [[Zane Truesdale (manga)|Kaiser]], when he decided to build an "all-his Deck", which would eventually grow into his ultimate Deck (since the "[[Elemental HERO]]" monsters he used previously were from [[Koyo Hibiki]]'s Deck).

  The [[Transformation Summon]] method is utilized by this archetype.

  == Design ==
  While the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype is said to be based off of American superheroes, it can also be assumed that the "Masked HERO" archetype is a salute to Japanese ''[[wikipedia:Kamen Rider|Kamen Rider]]'' heroes. In addition to "Kamen" meaning "Masked", there are several similarities between the two, such the recurring "form changing" and transformations of Kamen Riders. The Double Attacks are also similar to the original Kamen Riders' (1 and 2) "Rider Double" techniques.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Masked HERO" archetype centers on the "[[Change]]" archetype of [[Quick-Play Spell Card|Quick-Play Spells]], mainly "[[Mask Change]]", "[[Mask Change II]]" and "[[Form Change]]", which can "transform" a monster into a "Masked HERO" Fusion Monster, sending the monster on the field to the [[Graveyard|GY]] (or returning it to the Extra Deck in the case of "Form Change") and [[Special Summon]]ing the "Masked HERO" from the [[Extra Deck]] (rather than [[Fusion Summon]]ing like most [[Fusion Monster]]s do).

  In the manga, "Masked HERO" is an independent archetype featuring its own Main Deck monsters. In the ''[[TCG]]''/''[[OCG]]'' however, due to the lack of Main Deck "Masked HERO" monsters for over 14 years since the archetype's debut, the archetype had no de-facto "playing style", and instead primarily served as boss monsters for other "HERO" decks, such as "[[Elemental HERO]]" or "[[Destiny HERO]]" decks, or even a "HERO" cross-archetypal deck. As such, the "Change" Quick-Play Spells, which only worked on "Masked HERO" Main Deck monsters in the manga, were revamped to support all "[[HERO]]" monsters in the ''OCG''/''TCG''. 

  The most important Main Deck member is "[[Masked HERO Dusk Crow]]", which can Special Summon itself from the hand (by banishing a "HERO" monster from the GY), then upon its Normal or Special Summon, it lets the user add a "Masked HERO" monster from the Deck or GY to the hand, making it an important searcher and a recovery piece. Among the searchable monsters, "[[Masked HERO Furnace]]" lets the user search for a "Mask Change" or "[[Polymerization]]" then discard itself to be revived later whenever a non-FIRE "HERO" Fusion Monster is Special Summoned.

  All "Masked HERO" Fusion Monsters [[No Fusion Materials|do not list]] any [[Fusion Material]]s and share the condition that they must be Special Summoned by "Mask Change" (though "Mask Change II" and "Form Change" treats their effect's Special Summon as it were done with "Mask Change"). The "Masked HERO" Fusion Monsters all have a variety of battle-related, protective, recursion and/or disruptive effects. 

  * "[[Masked HERO Acid]]" and "[[Masked HERO Blast]]" can answer against Spell/[[Trap Card|Trap]]-heavy boards with their effects (destroying all Spells and Trap with "Acid" upon Special Summon or the Quick-Effect of "Blast" to return any Spell/Trap the opponent controls to their hand). Their on-Special Summon effects can also help weaken the ATK of an opponent's monster(s).

  * "[[Masked HERO Goka]]" and "[[Masked HERO Koga]]" serve as [[attack]]ing beatsticks, with the latter being able to weaken a monster's ATK by banishing a "HERO" monster.

  * "[[Masked HERO Atomic]]", "[[Masked HERO Divine Wind]]" and "[[Masked HERO Vapor]]" have protection to prevent themselves from being destroyed; A one-time protection for "Atomic", while "Divine Wind" and "Vapor" are immune to battle and effect destruction respectively. "Atomic" also can Special Summon any non-FIRE "Masked HERO" monster from the GY or [[banish]]ment upon its Special Summon, then it can also [[Set]] 1 "Change" Quick-Play Spell from the GY.

  * "[[Masked HERO Anki]]", "[[Masked HERO Dian]]" and "Masked HERO Divine Wind" can net card advantage for the user if they destroy a monster by battle, allowing a search of a "Change" Quick-Play Spell, a Special Summon of a "HERO" monster from the Deck, or a draw. 

  * The most prominent member of the archetype is "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]", having an oppressive one-sided "[[Macro Cosmos]]"-like effect while also punishing the opponent adding a card from their Deck to their [[hand]] by randomly banishing one card from their hand. Its [[DARK]]-Attribute makes it widely compatible with the entire DARK "HERO" arsennal including all "Destiny HEROs", all "[[Vision HERO]]s", "Dusk Crow" and "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]". 

  "[[Mask Change II]]" takes the splashability of "Masked HERO" monsters one step further, by allowing any monster with a [[Level]] to "transform" into a "Masked HERO" monster. However, some "Masked HERO" monsters still depend on "HERO" monsters to make use of their effects. 

  "Masked HERO" greatly benefits from generic "HERO" support cards such as "[[Elemental HERO Stratos]]" (an important searcher of any "HERO" monster while also being an ideal WIND "Mask Change"/"Mask Change II" target for "Masked HERO Blast" or "Divine Wind") and [[Vision HERO]]s "[[Vision HERO Vyon|Vyon]]" (along with "[[Vision HERO Faris|Faris]]" and "[[Vision HERO Increase|Increase]]"). "Elemental HERO Shadow Mist" is an important piece of support for the "Masked HERO" playstyle for either searching a "Change" Quick-Play Spell upon its Special Summon, or a "HERO" monster if it is sent to the GY. As such, "Shadow Mist" can search "Mask Change" or "Mask Change II", then be used as the target of that "Change" card to Summon "Dark Law" or "Anki", netting additional advantage through its second effect to search any "HERO" monster from the Deck whenever it is sent to the GY if done during the subsequent turn. "Masked HERO" also benefits from the following "Change" support cards: "[[Mask Charge]]", which can recur a "HERO" monster and a "Change" Quick-Play Spell from the GY, and "[[Xtra HERO Wonder Driver]]", which Sets a "Change" Quick-Play Spell from the GY whenever a "HERO" monster is Normal or Special Summoned to a [[Monster Zone]] it [[points to]], which combos very well with "Form Change".

  "Masked HERO" reinforces other general "HERO" decks by giving them a few additional boss monsters to make use of; multi-Attribute "HERO" decks ("Elemental HERO" and "[[Evil HERO]]") can use much of the main arsennal. In particular, "[[Elemental HERO Absolute Zero]]" pairs well with "Masked HERO Acid" to wipe the opponent's entire field while "Masked HERO Dark Law" is a welcome addition in most DARK-centric "HERO" decks. Meanwhile, most "HERO" Fusion Monsters' Levels are either Level 6 or 8, which align with those of the "Masked HERO" Fusion Monsters. "Change" Quick-Play Spells are also useful for allowing "HERO" monsters to "dodge" certain targeted disruptions (such as "[[Effect Veiler]]" and "[[Infinite Impermanence]]"), or being able to Summon more monsters during the [[Battle Phase]] for additional [[attack]]s. For typical "HERO" Fusion Summon tactics, "Furnace" is a "[[Polymerization]]" searcher and can revive itself, serving as an additional body for [[Link Monster|Link]] or Fusion plays. "Masked HERO" monsters can be used as [[Fusion Material]] to Fusion Summon "[[Contrast HERO Chaos]]" from the "Elemental HERO" archetype, which has a useful Quick Effect to negate a card's effects.
