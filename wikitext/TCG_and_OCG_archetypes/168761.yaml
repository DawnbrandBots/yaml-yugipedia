  "'''Masked HERO'''" ({{Ruby|Ｍ・ＨＥＲＯ|マスクドヒーロー}} ''Masukudo Hīrō'' in Japan, written as {{Ruby|Ｍ|マスクド}}・{{Ruby|ＨＥＲＯ|ヒーロー}} or {{Ruby|Ｍ|マスクド}}・{{Ruby|Ｈ|ヒーロー}} in the Japanese manga) is a "[[HERO]]" sub-[[archetype]] used by [[Jaden Yuki (manga)|Jaden Yuki]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX (manga)|''Yu-Gi-Oh! GX'' manga]]. Jaden started using this archetype after the tournament to [[Duel]] the [[Zane Truesdale (manga)|Kaiser]], when he decided to build an "all-his Deck", which would eventually grow into his ultimate Deck (since the "[[Elemental HERO]]" monsters he used previously were from [[Koyo Hibiki]]'s Deck).

  The [[Transformation Summon]] method is utilized by this archetype.

  == Design ==
  While the "[[Elemental HERO]]" archetype is said to be based off of American superheroes, it can also be assumed that the "Masked HERO" archetype is a salute to Japanese ''[[wikipedia:Kamen Rider|Kamen Rider]]'' heroes. In addition to "Kamen" meaning "Masked", there are several similarities between the two, such the recurring "form changing" and transformations of Kamen Riders. The Double Attacks are also similar to the original Kamen Riders' (1 and 2) "Rider Double" techniques.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Masked HERO" archetype centers on the "[[Change]]" archetype of [[Quick-Play Spell Card|Quick-Play Spells]], mainly "[[Mask Change]]", "[[Mask Change II]]" and "[[Form Change]]", which can "transform" a monster into a "Masked HERO" Fusion Monster, sending the monster on the field to the Graveyard (or returning it to the Extra Deck in the case of "Form Change") and [[Special Summon]]ing the "Masked HERO" from the [[Extra Deck]] (rather than [[Fusion Summon]]ing like most [[Fusion Monster]]s do).

  In the manga, "Masked HERO" is an independent archetype featuring its own Main Deck monsters. In the ''[[TCG]]''/''[[OCG]]'' however, they do not have any Main Deck monsters yet, and the "Change" Quick-Play Spells, which only worked on "Masked HERO" Main Deck monsters in the manga, were revamped to generally support "[[HERO]]" monsters. All "Masked HERO" Fusion Monsters [[No Fusion Materials|do not list]] any [[Fusion Material]]s and share the condition that they must be Special Summoned by "Mask Change" (though "Mask Change II" and "Form Change" treats their effect's Special Summon as it were done with "Mask Change"). Due to the lack of Main Deck monsters for over 14 years since the introduction of "Masked HERO", the archetype has no de-facto "playing style", and instead primarily served as boss monsters for other "HERO" decks, such as "[[Elemental HERO]]" or "[[Destiny HERO]]" decks, or even a cross-archetypal "HERO" archetypal deck. The most important support for the archetype's monsters is "[[Elemental HERO Shadow Mist]]", who can search out "Change" Spells when Special Summoned.

  The "Masked HERO" Fusion Monsters all have a variety of battle-related, protective and/or disruptive effects. "[[Masked HERO Acid]]" and "[[Masked HERO Blast]]" can answer against Spell/[[Trap Card|Trap]]-heavy boards. "[[Masked HERO Koga]]" and "[[Masked HERO Goka]]" serve as attacking beatsticks, "[[Masked HERO Divine Wind]]" and "[[Masked HERO Vapor]]" have protection to prevent themselves from being destroyed, while "[[Masked HERO Anki]]" and "[[Masked HERO Dian]]" (and "Divine Wind") can net card advantage for the user if they destroy a monster by battle. However, the most prominent member of the archetype is "[[Masked HERO Dark Law]]", having an oppressive one-sided "[[Macro Cosmos]]"-like effect while also punishing the opponent adding a card from their Deck to their hand by randomly banishing one card from their hand. Its [[DARK]]-Attribute makes it widely compatible with the entire DARK "HERO" arsennal including all "Destiny HEROs", all "[[Vision HERO]]s" and "Shadow Mist" (whom searches a "Change" card upon its Special Summon and can also be used as the target of the said card to Summon "Dark Law", netting additional advantage if done during the subsequent turn).

  "[[Mask Change II]]" takes the splashability of "Masked HERO" monsters one step further, by allowing any monster with a [[Level]] to "transform" into a "Masked HERO" monster. Netherless, some "Masked HERO" monsters still depend on "HERO" monsters to make use of their effects. Besides "Shadow Mist", "Masked HERO" also benefits from the following "Change" support cards: "[[Mask Charge]]", which can recur a "HERO" monster and a "Change" Quick-Play Spell from the GY, and "[[Xtra HERO Wonder Driver]]", which Sets a "Change" Quick-Play Spells from the GY whenever a "HERO" monster is Normal or Special Summoned to a zone it points to, which combos very well with "Form Change".
