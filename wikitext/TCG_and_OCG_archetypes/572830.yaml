  "'''Rose Dragon'''" (ローズ・ドラゴン ''Rōzu Doragon'') is an archetype of [[Dragon]] monsters based around "[[Black Rose Dragon]]", [[Akiza Izinski]]'s [[signature card]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]''. It is a sub-archetype of the "[[Rose]]" archetype.
  ==Design==
  "Rose Dragon" monsters appear as black serpentine creatures, whose bodies are (appropriately enough) covered in thorns, leaves, and flower petals. Every member has in the name a color that can occur in [[wikipedia:Rose|Rose]] flowers, which matches the hue of its own petals (except "Black Rose", which has crimson petals instead).
  ==Playing style==
  Despite being Dragons, "Rose Dragon" monsters are designed to synergize with [[Plant]] monsters. They focus on swarming the field and gaining advantage when used as Synchro Materials, as well as setting up the "[[Black Garden]]" [[Field Spell]].
  "[[White Rose Dragon]]" can Special Summon a "Rose Dragon" from the hand or GY when Normal Summoned, acting as a starter. It's second effect allows it to Special Summon itself from the hand if you control a Dragon or Plant [[Tuner monster]], allowing it to also act as an extender. It's third effect sends a level 4 or higher Plant monster from the deck to the GY when used as Synchro Material, setting up further plays with cards such as "[[World Carrotweight Champion]]". "[[Red Rose Dragon]]" Special Summons a "Rose Dragon" from hand or deck when used as Synchro Material, acting as an extender, but if you used it to Synchro Summon "Black Rose Dragon" or a Plant Synchro Monster, then you also get to search "[[Frozen Rose]]" or "[[Blooming of the Darkest Rose]]". "[[Blue Rose Dragon]]" acts as recovery from the mass destruction effect of "Black Rose Dragon", allowing you to still have a monster after wiping the board.
  The archetype also features a [[Link Monster]], "[[Crossrose Dragon]]", which has a [[Quick Effect]] to [[Tribute]] itself and a Plant monster to Special Summon a "Rose"/Plant Synchro Monster from the Extra Deck, treating it as a Synchro Summon, allowing you to trigger the effect of "Black Rose Dragon" on the opponent's turn. "Crossrose's" second effect allows you to banish it from the GY to Special Summon a "Rose Dragon" from the GY when a monster(s) you control is destroyed, allowing further recovery from the effect of your own "Black Rose Dragon".
  "[[Garden Rose Maiden]] is a level 5 Synchro Monster that can search "Black Garden" when Special Summoned, or banish itself from the GY to revive a "Rose Dragon" or Dragon Synchro Monster from the GY. "[[White Rose Cloister]]" is a Field Spell that lets you Special Summon a "Rose Dragon" or Plant monster from your hand if you control no monsters, acting as another play starter. It's also searchable by the effect of "[[Rose Princess]]" a Plant monster with an effect to Special Summon itself it only the opponent controls a monster, it  being treated as a Tuner while it is face-up on the field. "Frozen Rose" can act as a searcher or draw power for the deck, depending on the type of monster you send to the GY with it's effect; If you send a Non-Plant monster, you can add 1 level 4 or lower Plant Monster from your deck to your hand. If you send a Plant monster, you draw 2 cards, then discard 1 card. "Blooming of the Darkest Rose" is a Trap card designed to have synergy with Black Garden, allowing you to further fill the field with "[[Rose Token]]s".
