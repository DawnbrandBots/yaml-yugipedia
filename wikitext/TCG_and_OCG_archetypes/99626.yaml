  "'''Majestic'''", known as "'''Savior'''" (セイヴァー ''Seivā'') in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] of Level 10+ [[Dragon]] [[Synchro Monster]]s, all requiring "[[Majestic Dragon]]" as the [[Tuner monster]]. They are [[Card evolutions|upgraded]] forms of the [[Signer Dragon]]s, and in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, they are incarnations of the [[Crimson Dragon]] itself.

  Due to its Japanese name, "[[Avendread Savior]]" is also a member of this archetype. However, because ''[[TCG]]''/''[[OCG]]'' support for this archetype only specifies "Majestic" Synchro Monsters, this is not an issue.

  == Members ==
  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, when a Signer is about to Summon a "Majestic" monster, the [[Mark of the Dragon]] disappears from the Signers, only to re-appear on the back of that single Signer, who then [[Draw a card|draws]] "[[Majestic Dragon (anime)|Majestic Dragon]]" at the start of their turn. However, only two of the Signers, [[Yusei Fudo]] and [[Jack Atlas]], used this ability in the anime, so there are no "Majestic" forms of the other Signer Dragons.

  == Playing style ==
  The "Majestic" Synchro Monsters return to the [[Extra Deck]] during the [[End Phase]] and [[Special Summon]] the corresponding base [[Signer Dragon]] back from the [[Graveyard]]. Their effects are similar to their base forms, except they are more powerful; they can also negate the effect of an opponent's [[face-up]] monster and get an advantage from the negated card until the [[End Phase]]. One easy way to Summon the "Majestic" monsters is by Synchro Summoning "[[Malefic Paradox Dragon]]" without "[[Malefic World]]" on the [[field]], so it is destroyed, and then using "[[Shadow Impulse]]".
