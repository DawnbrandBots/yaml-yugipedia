  "'''Majestic'''", known as "'''Savior'''" (セイヴァー ''Seivā'') in Japanese, is an [[archetype]] of Level 10+ [[Dragon]] [[Synchro Monster]]s, all requiring "[[Majestic Dragon]]" as the [[Tuner monster]]. These monsters are [[Card evolutions|upgraded]] forms of the [[Signer Dragon]]s used by the [[Signer]]s in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime. They are granted to their users temporarily, by the power of the [[Crimson Dragon]]. In the anime, "[[Majestic Dragon (anime)|Majestic Dragon]]" is said to be the embodiment of the Crimson Dragon in the game. Due to its Japanese name, "[[Avendread Savior]]" is also a member of this archetype. However, because ''[[OCG]]''/''[[TCG]]'' support for this archetype only specifies "Majestic" Synchro Monsters, this is not an issue.

  == Members ==
  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, when a Signer is about to Summon a "Majestic" monster, the [[Mark of the Dragon]] disappears from the Signers, only to re-appear on the back of that single Signer, who then [[Draw a card|draws]] "[[Majestic Dragon (anime)|Majestic Dragon]]" at the start of their turn. However, only two of the Signers, [[Yusei Fudo]] and [[Jack Atlas]], used this ability in the anime, so there are no "Majestic" forms of the other Signer Dragons.

  == Playing style ==
  The original two "Majestic" Synchro Monsters return to the [[Extra Deck]] during the [[End Phase]] and [[Special Summon]] the corresponding base [[Signer Dragon]] back from the [[Graveyard]]. Their effects are similar to their base forms, except they are more powerful; they can also negate the effect of an opponent's [[face-up]] monster and get an advantage from the negated card until the [[End Phase]]. One easy way to Summon the "Majestic" monsters is through the second effect of [[Crimson Dragon (card)|Crimson Dragon]].
