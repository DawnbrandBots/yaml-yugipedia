  "'''End of the World'''", previously known as '''Ruin & Demise''' when it was a [[series]], is an [[archetype]] of cards based around two separate [[Ritual Monster]]s: "[[Demise, King of Armageddon]]" and "[[Ruin, Queen of Oblivion]]". They and their accompanying [[Ritual Spell]] (the eponymous "[[End of the World]]") were originally released in ''[[Shadow of Infinity]]'' and later received additional support in ''[[Cybernetic Horizon]]'', but this archetype was not supported by name until the release of ''[[Duelist Box: Prismatic Summon]]''.

  "End of the World" was particularly special for being the first Ritual Spell to be able to [[Ritual Summon]] one of two different Ritual Monsters. [[Demise, King of Armageddon (character)|Demise, King of Armageddon]] also appears as a character in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]''.

  ; The Two Gods Repeating the Cycle of the World's Destruction!
  ''"Demise", the one who destroys the world with all his might, and "Ruin", the one who brings about gentle destruction so that there may be rebirth. Their existences are two sides of the same coin – the moment one has finished their goal, the other appears to take their place, continuing the eternal cycle of the world's destruction.''<ref>[https://ygorganization.com/set-destroyers-to-gentle/ The Organization] - [VJUMP] Demise and Ruin Lore</ref>

  == Playstyle ==
  Regarding the original pair, "[[Demise, King of Armageddon]]" and "[[Ruin, Queen of Oblivion]]" were meant as board breakers capable of leading to [[OTK]]s. The latter did not see much play due to its effect being only usable in [[battle]], but the former was instead the protagonist of a Deck commonly known as ''Demise / Doom Dozer OTK'' around 2006-2007 which was so powerful that "Demise" itself was [[Semi-Limited]]. Such Deck revolved around [[Ritual Summon]]ing "Demise" with "[[Advanced Ritual Art]]" milling [[Insect]] monsters and using its effect to clear the board, then [[Special Summon]]ing "[[Doom Dozer]]" banishing those Insect monsters from the [[Graveyard]] and inflict exactly 8000 damage to the opponent if either "[[Megamorph]]" or another another copy of "Doom Dozer" was available.

  A whole series of new [[Ritual Monster]]s/[[Ritual Spell]]s (and the like) were released in ''[[Cybernetic Horizon]]'', offering more powerful effects and even more versatility. These cards were however underwhelming for their time and not worth the effort, thus they ended up seeing no competitive play. The theme could rely nonetheless on a boost in consistency thanks to the "[[Impcantation]]" archetype, which was introduced in the same set mentioned above, likely on purpose to support this theme since they revolves especially around Ritual Summoning [[Level 10]] Ritual Monsters (which this theme's boss monsters are).

  === Weaknesses ===
  * In the modern game, cards like "[[Lightning Storm]]" and "[[Evenly Matched]]" exist to offer board breaking effects similar to the "Demise" monsters, making the entire process to Ritual Summon them not worth the effort.
  * While Ritual Summoning strategies have received very good support throughout the years, this theme is inherently inconsistent due to its cards offering no consistency at all, with both Ritual Monsters and Ritual Spells having no use aside from their intended ones.
  ** The newer addition to the archetype, "[[End of the World Ruler]]", partially alleviated this flaw thanks to an almost unique interaction with the [[Main Deck]] that is immune to most [[List of unofficial terms|hand traps]].
