  "'''End of the World'''", previously known as "'''Ruin & Demise'''" when it was a [[series]], is an [[archetype]] of cards based around two separate [[Ritual Monster]]s: "[[Demise, King of Armageddon]]" and "[[Ruin, Queen of Oblivion]]". They and their accompanying [[Ritual Spell]] (the eponymous "[[End of the World]]") were originally released in ''[[Shadow of Infinity]]'' and later received additional support in ''[[Cybernetic Horizon]]'', but this archetype was not supported by name until the release of ''[[Duelist Box: Prismatic Summon]]''.

  "End of the World" was particularly special for being the first Ritual Spell to be able to [[Ritual Summon]] one of two different Ritual Monsters. [[Demise, King of Armageddon (character)|Demise, King of Armageddon]] also appears as a character in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]''.

  ; The Two Gods Repeating the Cycle of the World's Destruction!
  ''"Demise", the one who destroys the world with all his might, and "Ruin", the one who brings about gentle destruction so that there may be rebirth. Their existences are two sides of the same coin – the moment one has finished their goal, the other appears to take their place, continuing the eternal cycle of the world's destruction.''<ref>[https://ygorganization.com/set-destroyers-to-gentle/ The Organization] - [VJUMP] Demise and Ruin Lore</ref>

  == Playstyle ==
  The original "[[Demise, King of Armageddon]]" was used as a powerful board breaking and [[OTK]] tool.

  In competitive play, "Demise" would see the most play in ''Demise / Doom Dozer OTK'' around 2006-2007. These Decks would Ritual Summon "Demise" with "[[Advanced Ritual Art]]" (milling Insect monsters). The Insects would then be banished to Summon "[[Doom Dozer]]". "[[Megamorph]]" was used to gain enough ATK to OTK. Such Decks, while inconsistent, benefited from generic Ritual support, such as "[[Manju of the Ten Thousand Hands]]" and "[[Advanced Ritual Art]]".

  The newer series of cards released in ''[[Cybernetic Horizon]]'' offer more powerful effects than the originals, though their effects were underwhelming for their time, and did not have any in-theme consistency tools.

  === Weaknesses ===
  * In the modern game, cards like "[[Dark Hole]]", "[[Raigeki]]", "[[Lightning Storm]]", and "[[Evenly Matched]]" are legal, offering similar effects to "Demise" without needing to go through the effort to Ritual Summon.
  * Inconsistency. While Ritual support (especially modern cards like "[[Pre-Preparation of Rites]]") has alleviated this, Ritual cards are inherently multi-card combos.
