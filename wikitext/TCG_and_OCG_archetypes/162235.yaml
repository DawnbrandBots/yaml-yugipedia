They are the second stage of evolution, being evolved from [[Reptile]] "[[Evoltile]]s" and evolving into [[Dragon]] "[[Evolzar]]s".

  ==Trivia==
  * Their tails resemble a DNA strand.
  * Their pictures have some sort of molecule in the background.
  ** It is likely an artistic imagining of a [[wikipedia:nucleic acid|nucleic acid]], since it bears resemblance to [[wikipedia:Nucleobase|bases]] and a [[wikipedia:Sugar phosphates|sugar phosphate]]-like backbone. Interestingly, the bases don't correspond to any natural bases, the phosphate-like groups are not true phsophates and the many of the Nitrogen atoms have too many bonds, and would not be stable structures.
  * Their pictures also have a depiction of the evolution of man in the lower right corner.
  * Their Japanese name, Evolder is spelled in a way that sounds a lot like "Evoluder", a fictional term for a human being that's evolved beyond humanity from the anime "Yuusha-Oh GaoGaiGar".
  * So far, "[[Evolsaur Lios]]" is the only "Evolsaur" Monster that doesn't need to be Special Summoned by the effect of an "[[Evoltile]]" monster in order to activate its effects.
