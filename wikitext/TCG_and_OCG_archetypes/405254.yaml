  "'''Phantom Knights'''", known as "'''Phantom'''" (ファントム ''Fantomu'') in Japan, is an [[archetype]] used by [[Yuto]] in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]''. It contains one sub-archetype, "[[The Phantom Knights]]".
  Due to their Japanese names, a number of unrelated cards, such as "[[Grass Phantom]]" and "[[Odd-Eyes Phantom Dragon]]", also fall into this archetype. However, because ''OCG'' support for this archetype only works on [[Spell Card|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]]s, this is not an issue, unless one of the aforementioned monsters is converted into a Spell by another card.
