  "'''Rebellion'''" (リベリオン ''Riberion'') is an archetype of [[DARK]] [[Xyz Monsters]] used by [[Yuya Sakaki]], [[Yuto]], and [[Z-ARC]] in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'' anime. It is related to the "[[Odd-Eyes]]", "[[The Phantom Knights]]", "[[Raidraptor]]" and "[[Xyz Dragon]]" archetypes.

  The cards "[[Rebellion]]" and "[[Darklord Rebellion]]" are not members of the archetype, but since the support for this archetype only affects Xyz Monsters, this is not an issue.

  ==Playing style==
  Due to the varied Xyz Summoning requirements for each "Rebellion" monster, the archetype generally does not share a common playing style across all of their members.

  The Rank 4 and 5 "Rebellion" members ("[[Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]", "[[Supreme King Dragon Dark Rebellion]]" and "[[Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]") play identically to the "[[Xyz Dragon]]" archetype, having effects that can help them reach up to high ATK values and/or reduce opposing monsters' ATK to aid them in battle. While "Arc Rebellion Xyz Dragon" requires 3 Level 5 monsters, it can be alternatively be Xyz Summoned via "[[Raider's Knight]]" (whose Xyz Summon requirements are similar to the other two Rank 4 "Rebellion" monsters) and can be used in a variety of appropriate DARK and/or [[Pendulum Monster|Pendulum]] decks.

  The "Rebellion" members that are also "Odd-Eyes" members (ie. "[[Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon]]" and "[[Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon Overlord]]") focuses on being able to attack 3 times though it is difficult to set up the material requirements of Xyz Summoning "[[Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon]]" and getting its effect off. The introduction of the archetype's first support, "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon Overlord", gives this playstyle an alternate game plan. "Overlord" can be Xyz Summoned by using any "Rebellion" monster as material, and it too can attack 3 times like its original counterpart although it requires to be Xyz Summoned using a Rank 7 Xyz Monster as material to gain this effect. Thus, if "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon" is Summoned (Xyz Summoned or simply cheated out of the [[Extra Deck]] with an effect such as "[[Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon]]") and then simply Xyz Summoning its "Overlord" counterpart on top of it. If "Overlord" goes to the Pendulum Zone, its Pendulum Effect can be used to Special Summon itself from there, then Xyz Summon any "Rebellion" or "The Phantom Knights" monster using itself as material. If used to summon its original counterpart this way, this allows usage of its original counterpart with its effect being able to be activated. Meanwhile, "[[Odd-Eyes Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]" can selectively destroy up to two monsters. While it cannot be used as material for an Xyz Summon on the turn it is Xyz Summoned, Special Summoning it by other methods (such as the aformentioned "Odd-Eyes Absolute Dragon") will allow this card to be used as material to Xyz Summon "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon Overlord".

  The most practical use of "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon Overlord" is to be the "middle-man" for the other "Rebellion" members to [[Xyz Evolution|rank up]] to after they battle (or battling another Xyz Monster), before finally Xyz Summoning "[[Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder]]" on top of "Overlord" with enough materials to use its Quick Effect.

  "[[Raidraptor - Rising Rebellion Falcon]]" does not synergize with the other members of the archetype aside from "Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon Overlord".
