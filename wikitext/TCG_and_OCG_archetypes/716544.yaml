  "'''S-Force'''", known as "'''Security Force'''" ({{Ruby|Ｓ－Ｆｏｒｃｅ|セキュリティ・フォース}} ''Sekyuriti Fōsu'') in the ''[[OCG]]'', is an [[archetype]] debuting in ''[[Blazing Vortex]]'', comprised of [[LIGHT]] and [[DARK]] monsters with various [[Type]]s.

  ==Design==
  [[File:Crest S-Force.png|left|thumb|150px|The "S-Force" crest.]]
  The "S-Force" monsters are a futuristic security team, as the name implies, featuring a plethora of human and humanoid members. They have ties to the "[[Time Thief]]" and "[[PSY-Frame]]" archetypes in both design and lore, with members from the latter two appearing in [[S-Force Showdown|some]] [[S-Force Specimen|artworks]] of this archetype; they were initially alluded to within the flavor text of "[[PSY-Frame Driver]]".

  In addition, the "[[Evil★Twin]]" archetype can also be considered to be connected to "S-Force", as the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Game Art Works]]'' book contains a piece of concept art depicting Chiyomaru interviewing [[Evil★Twin's Trouble Sunny|Sunny and Luna]] while Masquerena hangs out with [[Evil★Twin Ki-sikil|Ki-sikil]] and [[Evil★Twin Lil-la|Lil-la]].

  ==Playing style==
  The archetype has a control-themed play-style similar to the [[Ice Barrier]] archetype, utilizing [[banish]]ing and [[Special Summon]]s to restrict the opponent's options via effects based on their monsters. Unlike Ice Barrier, however, the S-Force's effect works on monsters in the same column as the player's "S-Force" monsters, thus creating a theme of "arresting" the opponent. "[[S-Force Rappa Chiyomaru]]" is the main playmaker of the 
  archetype, bringing out other "S-Force" monsters from the deck. Some "S-Force" that can be brought out with this effect include "[[S-Force Gravitino]]" for its search effect and on-field banish, "[[S-Force Pla-Tina]]"and "[[S-Force Edge Razor]]" for extending. 

  The deck spell and traps give the deck extra swarming, removal and search, "[[S-Force Specimen]]" and "[[S-Force Showdown]]" provide extra swarming and revival. "[[S-Force Bridgehead]]" provide searching and "[[S-Force Chase]]" is the deck's strongest removal trap.  

  The main goal of the deck is to swarm the field with as many "S-Force" as possible in order to achieve complete lock down of the opponent's field. Their boss monster, "[[S-Force Justify]]", helps out with this strategy by restricting 3 zones, making it easier for your S-Force monsters to lock out the remaining 2 zones your opponent has.
