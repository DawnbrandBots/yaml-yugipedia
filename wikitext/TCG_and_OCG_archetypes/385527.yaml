  "'''Magician Girl'''" (マジシャン・ガール ''Majishan Gāru'') is an [[archetype]] of [[Spellcaster]] [[Monster Card|monsters]] used by [[Yugi Muto]], including the "[[Dark Magician Girl (archetype)|Dark Magician Girl]]" sub-archetype. It is centered on "[[Dark Magician Girl]]", its earliest member, which has existed since the [[Battle City (manga arc)|Battle City]] arc of the original series, although the archetype had no support until the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions Movie Pack]]''.

  == Members ==
  The archetype is composed of "[[Dark Magician Girl]]", her evolutions and counterparts, a quintet created for ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions]]'', and the thematically-unrelated "[[Performapal Sky Magician Girl]]".

  The movie quintet is clearly inspired by "Dark Magician Girl", which is a [[Level]] 6 [[DARK]] monster; each member of it has one of the other [[Attribute]]s and a Level from 1 to 5. They are named after fruits or sweets, and when sorted by Level ("Berry", "Lemon", "Apple", "Chocolate", "Kiwi"), their initials spell out the word "Black", referencing the the Japanese name of "Dark Magician Girl" ("Black Magician Girl"). Their [[effects]] either [[Special Summon]] Spellcaster monsters or manipulate [[ATK]]/[[DEF]].

  == Playing style ==
  The "Magician Girl" monsters' main feature is Special Summoning [[Spellcaster]] monsters from the player's hand or Graveyard when they are attacked, with "Apple" and "Lemon" in particular redirecting the attack to the Special Summoned monster while halving the attacking monster's ATK. This ability, together with cards like "[[Magical Dimension]]" and "[[Dark Renewal]]", allows them to easily Summon high-Level Spellcaster monsters while making it more difficult for the opponent to plan their [[Battle Phase]].

  With the multiple cards that cross-support "[[Dark Magician]]" and "[[Dark Magician Girl]]", and the multiple Special Summoning effects "Magician Girl" monsters have, "Dark Magician" is a possible tech for the Deck.

  Due to the many effects that only trigger when they are targeted for attacks however, the theme may become somewhat slow. Because of that, cards that force attacks like "[[Battle Mania]]", "[[All-Out Attacks]]", "[[Savage Colosseum]]", and "[[Yang Zing Unleashed]]" also become interesting options.
