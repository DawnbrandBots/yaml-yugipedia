  According to the lore, "Sinful Spoils" are human souls separated from their bodies by demons, with the bodies taken over and turned into the "[[Azamina]]" monsters. The exception to this is "[[Diabellstar Vengeance]]", which is "Diabellstar the Black Witch" willingly fusing herself with "Silvera" and "Rciela".

  "[[Snake-Eyes Doomed Dragon]]" is also described as the soul of "Diabellze the Original Sinkeeper" subjected to the same process, despite not being treated as a "Sinful Spoils" card.
