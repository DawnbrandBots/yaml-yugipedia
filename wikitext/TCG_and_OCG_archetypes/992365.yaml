  Mainly constisting of [[Spell]]s and [[Trap Card]]s, this archetype supports the "[[Azamina]]", "[[Snake-Eye]]", "[[Diabell]]" and "[[Diabellstar]]" archetypes. Additionally, the "[[Morganite]]" archetype is related to it by lore.

  ==Design==
  According to lore, "Sinful Spoils" are the souls of humans who have been deceived and cursed by the demon "[[Azamina (card)|Azamina]]". The demon's curse severs the soul from the body, transforming the soul into a cursed artifact that spreads disasters (the "Sinful Spoils"), while the body is transformed into a living puppet under the demon's control (the "[[Azamina]]" monsters). "[[Diabellstar Vengeance]]" is an exception, as it is the form taken by "Diabellstar the Black Witch" after using her attachment magic (which can counteract the curse) to fuse with "Silvera" and "Rciela".

  Most "Sinful Spoils" also have animal and color motifs.
