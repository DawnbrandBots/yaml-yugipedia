  | lore                  = While "[[Dark Necrofear]]" is [[face-up]] on your [[field]], "[[Destiny Board]]" and "[[Spirit Message]]" cards you [[control]] are [[unaffected]] by your opponent's card [[effect]]s. If a "Spirit Message" card would be placed on your field with "Destiny Board", you can [[Special Summon]] it as a [[Normal Monster]] ([[Fiend]]/[[DARK]]/[[Level]] 1/[[ATK]] 0/[[DEF]] 0) instead. It cannot be [[target]]ed for [[attack]]s, but does not prevent your opponent from attacking you directly. [[Once per turn]], you can [[reveal]] 1 "Spirit Message" card in your [[hand]] and place it on the bottom of the [[Main Deck|Deck]], then [[Draw a card|draw]] 1 card.
