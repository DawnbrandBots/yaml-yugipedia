You can [[banish]] this card and any number of "Cubic" monsters from your [[Graveyard]], then target face-up monsters your opponent controls equal to the number of those banished "Cubic" monsters; place 1 [[Cubic Counter]] on each of them. (Monsters with a Cubic Counter cannot [[attack]], also [[negate]] their [[effect]]s.)
