  | text         = If you [[control]] a "Cubic" monster: [[Activate]] this card by [[target]]ing any number of monsters that are in your opponent's [[Graveyard]] because they were [[destroy]]ed and [[sent]] there this [[turn]]; [[Special Summon]] them to your opponent's field, but each becomes [[ATK]] 0 and has 1 [[Cubic Counter]] placed on it. (Monsters with a Cubic Counter cannot [[attack]], also [[negate]] their effects.) While your opponent controls any of the monsters Summoned by this effect, negate any [[monster effect]]s your opponent activates. When the last of these monsters [[leaves the field]], destroy this card.
