  | lore             = [[Send]] the top card of your [[Main Deck|Deck]] to the [[Graveyard]]. If you [[sent]] a [[LIGHT]] [[Attribute]] [[Galaxy]] [[Type]] [[monster]] to the [[Graveyard]] by this [[effect]], you can choose up to 3 [[face-up]] monsters on your [[field]]. If you do, those monsters inflict [[piercing]] [[battle damage]] (if the [[ATK]] of the attacking monster exceeds the DEF of the attack target, inflict the difference), if they attack a [[Defense Position]] monster this [[turn]]. Then, if you chose "[[Transamu Rainac]]" by this effect, you can change all [[Attack Position]] monsters on your opponent's field to face-up Defense Position.
