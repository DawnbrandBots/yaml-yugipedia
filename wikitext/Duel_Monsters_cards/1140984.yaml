If you Synchro Summon a monster that mentions a "Synchron" Tuner as material, this card in your hand can also be used as material. If a monster(s) you control that mentions "Junk Warrior" and/or is a Synchro Monster with "Warrior" in its original name would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can banish this card from your field or GY instead.
