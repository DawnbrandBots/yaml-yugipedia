And while Mercurium has material, your opponent cannot activate any monster effects in their Graveyard, if you have a monster with that same Attribute in YOUR Graveyard. Mercurium needs to be kept fed with new materials to keep this effect going, but as long as you can keep him satisfied, you’ll be able to shut down your opponent’s key strategies!|source=Blurb from [https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/products/bpro/ yugioh-card.com]}}
