By installing a "Beef-Rifle" or other armaments, it can be used as medium and long range support for the "Steam Knights" and their operations. Also, "BULLauncher" can be combined with "WINGear" which specializes in high-speed aerial combat and "BOARms", which specializes in melee and assault combat, to cause the high calorie "Steam Jushin - BW" to descend upon this world.''
