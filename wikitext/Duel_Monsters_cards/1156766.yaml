[...] Okay, I'll keep reading. Hmmâ€¦AND it draws a card for every Call of the Haunted you control. That's new! [...] What if we draw it the first turn? Don't worry, it says you can also use this same card to get the Field Spell out of your Deck. [...] Hey, you're right! You can get the Field Spell, OR a Level 6 Zombie, like yourself. And it bumps up Zombies' Attack Points, and draws a card for every Call of the Haunted you control. That seems like a lot. It's good to be the King!|source=Blurb from [https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/products/mzmu/ yugioh-card.com]}}
