If your opponent [[Special Summon]]s a monster(s) and they activated [[monster effect]]s 4 or more times this [[turn]]: You can Special Summon 1 "[[Jurrac Meteor]]" from your [[Extra Deck]]. (This is treated as a [[Synchro Summon]].) If a "Jurrac" monster(s) you control would be destroyed by card [[effect]], you can [[banish]] 1 Dinosaur monster from your [[GY]] instead. You can only use each [[effect]] of "Jurrac Volcano" [[once per turn]].
