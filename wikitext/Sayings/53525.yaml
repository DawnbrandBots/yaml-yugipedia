  {{For|other users|Heart of the Cards (disambiguation)}}
  The '''Heart of the Cards''' (カードの心 ''Kādo no Kokoro'') is a philosophy in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (manga)|''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' manga]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|anime]] that maintains that by treating ''[[Duel Monsters]]'' cards as something precious they develop hearts of their own.<ref name="d 9">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|9|ref}}</ref><ref name="dm 1">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|1|ref}}</ref> It claims that understanding this and loving one's cards is necessary to find the true strength of the game.<ref name="d 9" /><ref name="d 10">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|10|ref}}</ref>

  The concept is briefly touched on the Japanese manga and not given a name. The Japanese anime slightly expands on it and introduces the name "Heart of the Cards". It is more frequently mentioned in the English anime, where it is used by players to help draw the right card at the right time. The English manga adopted the name "Heart of the Cards" after it had been used in the anime.

  == Manga ==
  As [[Sugoroku Mutou (manga)|Sugoroku Mutou]] explained to [[Seto Kaiba (manga)|Seto Kaiba]] why he would not trade his "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (manga)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]", he said that if you really treasure something it grows a heart of its own, like his card did, and you would never trade that card for anything. And advised Kaiba to take good care of each card in [[Duralumin case|his case]] in order to find the true strength of the game. The next day, Kaiba pretended to have taken Sugoroku's advice about loving cards for long enough for him to get a chance to steal the "Blue-Eyes White Dragon". When Yugi confronted him about the theft, he ridiculed the idea of cards having hearts.<ref name="d 9" />

  [[Dark Yugi (manga)|Dark Yugi]] faced Kaiba in a [[Shadow Game (manga)|Shadow Game]] of ''Duel Monsters'' and Kaiba attempted to cheat by slipping the stolen "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" from his pocket into his hand. However because Kaiba's soul was not in the card, it refused to attack and instead destroyed itself out of loyalty to Sugoroku. Kaba lost the Duel and as [[Penalty Game (manga)|Penalty Game]], Dark Yugi caused him to suffer a nightmare where became a card, residing in the [[World of Duel Monsters]] where he [[Experience of Death|experienced death]]. It was Dark Yugi's hope that by becoming a card Kaiba would gain a heart for the game. (In the English version, he hoped Kaiba would understand the Heart of the Cards.) And after doing that could become a true master of the game.<ref name="d 10" />

  Dark Yugi and Kaiba Dueled again in [[Death-T]], which ended with Dark Yugi Summoning "[[Exodia]]", an act Kaiba said would take a miracle. Dark Yugi replied that miracles happen when someone unites their hearth with their cards. (In the English version, he said that miracles happen when you remember the Heart of the Cards.)<ref name="d 40">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|40|ref}}</ref>

  == Anime ==
  As [[Solomon Muto]] explained to [[Seto Kaiba]] why he would not trade his "[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]", he said that your heart lives inside your most precious cards. Kaiba left and angrily thought to himself that the notion of cards having hearts is ridiculous.<ref name="dm 1" />

  Kaiba administered a challenge to Solomon and sent his men to deliver the message and use force if he declined. Solomon decided that he should take the opportunity to teach Kaiba about the Heart of the Cards. His grandson, [[Yugi Muto]], arrived after Solomon lost the Duel and Solomon handed him his Deck, pleading with him to teach Kaiba the Heart of the Cards, as he had failed to do so. [[Yami Yugi]] won the Duel using "[[Exodia]]", an act Kaiba said would take a miracle. Yami Yugi replied that miracles happen when someone unites their hearth with their cards.<ref name="dm 1" />

  Yugi refrained from entering tournaments, vowing that the next one he enters would be one where he faces Kaiba in a fair fight after he learned about the Heart of the Cards.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|2|ref}}</ref>

  During the [[Duelist Kingdom]] tournament, Yami Yugi told [[Mokuba Kaiba]] that Seto Kaiba was suffering in order to learn about the Heart of the Cards and win back his pride and that he would return when he learned about the Heart of the Cards.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|8|ref}}</ref> When Kaiba arrived on the island, Yugi returned his stolen Deck to him and asked if he had learned the Heart of the Cards. Kaiba replied that he does not have an answer yet.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|16|ref}}</ref>

  [[Yugi Muto]] often refers to the Heart of the Cards as helping him win Duels, as well as criticizing his opponents for not believing in it. His best friend [[Joey Wheeler]] is also a strong believer in the Heart of the Cards.

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'', the concept is referred to during [[Jaden Yuki]]'s Duel with [[Dimitri]]. [[Winged Kuriboh (character)|Winged Kuriboh]] points out that since Dimitri is not Yugi, the Heart of the Cards is not on his side. Although not stated directly, multiple characters remark on Jaden's ability to always draw the right card when he needs it;{{fact}} for example, he seemingly always draws "[[Elemental Hero Neos Knight (anime)|Elemental Hero Neos]]" despite only having a single copy. Jaden has stated that the reason he draws what he needs is because he believes in his Deck, and because his Deck also believes in him.{{fact}}

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'', the concept is referred to by [[Yusei Fudo]] several times during different Duels. He talks about believing in the cards and how the cards will always answer if you do.{{fact}} Though he does not explicitly state it, [[Crow Hogan]] seems to believe in this concept, believing that he Deck was sending him messages in the cards that he draws.{{fact}} In the Japanese version, there is a similar concept known as "possessing the soul of a duelist", which also relies on believing in one's cards.{{fact}}

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'', Astral seems to believe in this concept, as he tells Yuma to tap into his heart and believe in his cards.{{fact}} Some characters, including Yuma, actually have a visible power to draw exactly what they need (see [[Shining Draw]] and [[Seven Barian Emperors#Chaos Draw|Chaos Draw]]). Kaito also believes in this concept and uses it in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL - Episode 106|Episode 106]].

  In the dubbed version of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]'' [[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS - Episode 030|episode 30]], [[Ai]] shouts "Heart of the cards, guide me!" when attempting to draw a "cute" card from [[Emma|Ghost Gal's]] Deck.

  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS]]'', [[Lucidien Kallister|Luke]] claims that understanding the Heart of the Cards is the beginning of his Luke-style Dueling.

  == Video games ==
  Several video games include a [[Destiny Draw (rule)|Destiny Draw]] mechanic, allowing a character who is behind to draw a card to reverse the tide of the Duel, similar to the Heart of the Cards in the anime.
  * In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses]]'', the Destiny Draw has a chance of adding a card to the player's Deck that could potentially turn a losing Duel around.
  * In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links]]'', [[Yami Yugi (Duel Links)|Yami Yugi]] has access to a [[Skill]] called [[Destiny Draw (Skill)|Destiny Draw]], which allows him to draw the card of his choice after losing Life Points. In the English version, he has a unique quote when using this Skill: "Heart of the Cards, guide me! I draw!"
