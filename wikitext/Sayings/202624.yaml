  "'''Feeling the flow'''", called "'''Kattobing'''" (かっとビング ''Kattobingu'') in Japanese, is [[Yuma Tsukumo]]'s catchphrase and life philosophy in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|''Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL'' anime]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (manga)|manga]]. In the English dub, he also uses the phrase "'''Hi-Five the Sky'''" to refer to this concept, while in the English translation of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL'' manga, he instead uses the phrase "'''Jetting'''", in the sense of flying high.

  The phrase was coined by Yuma's father, [[Kazuma Tsukumo]], who passed it on to his son; Yuma considers it to be one of the most important things his father ever taught him. According to him, the meaning behind the term is to never give up even if something seems impossible; to always challenge, and to believe in oneself.<ref name="ep19>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|19|ref}}</ref> Yuma follows this thought firmly thanks to the [[Emperor's Key|pendant]] his father gave him, which makes him feel like his father is always with him and thus makes him able to "feel the flow", no matter how much other people may ridicule him for it.<ref name="ch1>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|1|ref}}</ref><ref name="ch2>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|2|ref}}</ref>

  "Kattobing" has no actual meaning in Japanese, and has many possible origins. It may come from ''katto'' (カッと), which means "to flare up" or "to act resolutely", or from ''kattobasu'' (かっ飛ばす), which means "to slam" or "to knock out"; and ''bing'' may simply be an onomatopoeia added to the end of the word to make it sound "cool". For many years before the release of the non-game card "[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL (card)|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]", the term was commonly romanized as "'''Kattobingu'''" by the community, due to a lack of an official translation. This term appears in the name of the card "[[Hi-Five the Sky]]" (''Kattobing Challenge''). The Field Spell "[[Onomatopia]]" uses "[[Hi-Five the Sky Counter]]s" (''Kattobing Counter''). The [[illegal]] card "[[Creator of Hope]]" requires the player to shout "''Kattobing! Ore!''" as a [[cost]] in order to [[activate]] its effect.

  == Variants ==
  In the Japanese anime, after hearing it from Yuma, other characters later go on to use their own variations of ''kattobing'', either with the same spirit of taking on great challenges or to make a joke.
