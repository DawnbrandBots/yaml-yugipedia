title: Summon chant

  {{Incomplete}}

  In various incarnations of ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' franchise, most notably starting with the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' anime, characters will recite a '''chant''' while Summoning a powerful monster.

  While most chants are unique or almost unique between specific monsters, a few series of cards are shown to use nearly identical chants (sometimes with the name of the monster being the only change), such as the [[Dark Synchro Monster]]s.

  For the first season of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's'' English dub, the chants of the main protagonists when [[Synchro Summon]]ing were removed in favor of catchphrases like "Let's rev it up!", with a few chants in some episodes. During Season 2, chants began to be used more often.

  The chants for each given character tend to have a common theme that reflects their personality. 

  '''NOTE:''' ''If you can locate the Japanese characters and romanizations for the chants, that would be much appreciated by those who prefer them over the English translations. That is not to say the translations should be removed, but rather the characters/romanizations should be provided for those who want them.''

  '''SIDE NOTE:''' ''Toonzaki has official subtitles of the episodes. If it is possible, please copy their versions of the chants as separate examples for those who prefer them over the fan translations. That is not to say the fan translations should be replaced with the official ones, but rather both translations should be provided for those who want either or.''

  ==Trivia==
  * Currently, only 8 Synchro Monsters have been Summoned without chants; "[[Goyo Guardian (anime)|Goyo Guardian]]", "[[Iron Chain Dragon (anime)|Iron Chain Dragon]]", "[[Dark Strike Fighter (anime)|Dark Strike Fighter]]", "[[Armory Arm (anime)|Armory Arm]]", "[[Turbo Cannon]]", "[[Stygian Sergeants (anime)|Stygian Sergeants]]", "[[X-Saber Wayne (anime)|X-Saber Wayne]]", and "[[D/D/D Gust High King Executive Alexander (anime)|D/D/D Gust High King Executive Alexander]]".

  * For the animation of most Summon chants from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 4]]'', ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 5|5]]'', and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Tag Force 6|6]]'', most characters close their eyes and put their fist on their chest/heart, then open their eyes and raise their palm of their hand skyward.

  * In ''Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V'', chants for Ritual (and some Synchro and Fusion) Monsters include the Level of the Monster, and chants for Xyz Monsters include their Rank.

  * Fusion Monster chants in ''Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V'' generally reference the Fusion Material Monsters in their chants, albeit in a more descriptive fashion. This means that on occasion, as seen with "[[Gem-Knight Master Diamond (anime)|Gem-Knight Master Diamond]]", the chants will change depending on the Fusion Material Monsters used.

  * When announcing the Summon Type in the Japanese anime, the Duelist simply states the Summoning Type, but in the English version, they declare "I (Type) Summon!" This is changed in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V]]'', where the Duelists sometimes use the Japanese format in declaring the Summon name.

  * Summon chants in ''Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V'' are usually divided into 2 parts: the first part depicts the trait of the monster, and the last part roughly explains how it's summoned.
