Then, add up to 2 [[Level 4]] or lower EARTH Machine-Type monsters from your Graveyard whose combined [[ATK]] is less than or equal to the ATK of the monster you sent to the Graveyard.
  This [[Skill]] will only activate if you begin the [[Duel]] with a [[Deck]] (excluding [[Extra Deck]]) that has 3 or more Level 10 EARTH Machine-Type monsters. This Skill can only be used once per Duel.
