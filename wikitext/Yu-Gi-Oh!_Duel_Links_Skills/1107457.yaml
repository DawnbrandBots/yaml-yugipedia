  1: Can be activated before your normal draw. One of the cards from your normal draw this turn will be 1 "[[Dragon of Pride and Soul]]" from your Deck. Send all other cards from your hand, Deck, Extra Deck, and field to the Graveyard, and return all of your banished cards to the Graveyard. Then, if you have 25 or more cards in your Graveyard, randomly send 25 cards with the same names as those in your Graveyard from outside of your Deck to your opponent's Graveyard. After using this Skill, you cannot Normal/Special Summon monsters, except "Dragon of Pride and Soul", nor activate card effects for the rest of this Duel.<br/>
  2: Place 1 "Dragon of Pride and Soul" from your hand on the bottom of your Deck, then draw 2 cards.
