[[Once per turn]], during the [[Battle Step]], if your [[monster]] battles an opponent's monster: You can change that opponent's monster's [[ATK]] to 0 (until the end of this [[turn]]), and if you do, neither monster can be destroyed by that battle, also neither player takes [[battle damage]] from that battle. When your opponent [[activate]]s a card or effect during the [[Damage Step]] while your "[[Code Talker (archetype)|Code Talker]]" monster is [[attack]]ing: You can [[banish]] this card from your [[GY]]; [[negate]] the activation, and if you do, the attacking monster gains 700 ATK.
