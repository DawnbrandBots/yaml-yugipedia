You can [[target]] any number of your "[[Visas]]" monsters that are [[banish]]ed, on your [[field]], and/or in your [[GY]]; [[shuffle]] those "Visas" monsters into the [[Main Deck|Deck]], and if you do, [[Special Summon]] this card from your [[hand]], and if you do that, it gains 400 [[ATK]] for each monster with different names shuffled by this effect. You can only use this [[effect]] of "Visas Samsara" [[once per turn]]. If this card you [[control]] would be used as [[Synchro Material]], you can treat it as a non-Tuner.
