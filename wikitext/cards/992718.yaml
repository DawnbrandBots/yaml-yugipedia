  | lore                  = While you [[control]] a "[[Memento]]" [[monster]], your opponent's monsters that can [[attack]] must attack the "Memento" monster you control with the highest [[ATK]] (their choice, if tied). When your opponent [[activate]]s a [[monster effect]] on the [[field]]: You can [[target]] 1 "[[Mementoral Tectolica, the Netherskull Dragon]]" you control; it loses exactly 1000 ATK/[[DEF]], and if it does, [[negate]] that activated effect. You can only [[activate]] this effect of "Memento Cranium Burst" once per Chain.
