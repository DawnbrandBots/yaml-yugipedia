  '''Tokens''' (Japanese: トークン ''Tōkun'') are a type of [[Monster Card|monster]] that can only be created by card [[effect]]s, certain [[Summoning condition]]s, or [[Skill]]s. They are not included in the [[Main Deck|Main]] or [[Extra Deck]], as stated as [[limitation text]] on each card.

  In the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|TCG]]'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game|OCG]]'', a Monster Token can be represented by an official, grey-colored Token card, but can also be represented by any object that can unambiguously indicate its own battle position. These can include proxy cards, coins (Heads is treated as [[Attack Position]] and Tails is treated as [[Defense Position]]), or a die.

  == Characteristics ==
  Tokens in a [[Monster Zone]] are always [[Normal Monster]]s, and never have effects. Some Monster Tokens have effects applied to them by the cards that Summon them, but these are not the effects of the Tokens themselves, so they cannot be negated by cards like "[[Skill Drain]]". Many video games include the restrictions from the effect or Skill that created it in the Token's [[card text]], but it is still not considered to be an effect of the Token itself.

  The [[owner]] of a Token is the player who [[Special Summon]]ed it. For example, "[[Owner's Seal]]" will change control of "[[Ojama Token]]s" Special Summoned by the effect of "[[Ojama Trio]]" to the player who activated "Ojama Trio".

  === Summoning Tokens ===
  Tokens can only be [[Special Summon]]ed by card effects, or [[Skill Card]]s, that specifically [[Mentions|mention]] their names. Due to this, if a Token becomes treated as a [[Spell Card]] by a card effect (e.g. "[[The Grand Jupiter]]" or "[[Sinful Spoils of Subversion - Snake-Eye]]"), it cannot be Special Summoned back from the [[Spell & Trap Zone]].

  As Tokens cannot be Normal Summoned or Set, they are considered [[Special Summon Monster]]s.

  === Can only exist on the field ===
  Tokens can only exist on the [[field]], and cannot exist anywhere else. They cannot be [[attach]]ed as [[Xyz Material]], because Xyz Materials [[attach]]ed to an [[Xyz Monster]] are not considered to be on the field; consequently, they cannot be used as Xyz Material for an [[Xyz Summon]] or be [[target]]ed or affected by effects that would attach them to an Xyz Monster (e.g. "[[Number 101: Silent Honor ARK]]").

  === Can only exist face-up ===
  Tokens can only exist [[face-up]], and cannot exist [[face-down]]. Thus, they cannot be [[target]]ed by, and are unaffected by, effects that would [[flip]] them face-down (e.g. "[[Book of Moon]]", "[[Swords of Concealing Light]]"). If an [[Attack Position]] Token would be affected by a card that would change it to face-down [[Defense Position]], such as "[[Swords of Concealing Light]]", its [[battle position]] is not changed.

  Tokens cannot be banished face-down, and are unaffected by card effects that would do so.

  === Leaving the field ===
  If a Token would [[leave the field]] (i.e. it would be moved to the [[hand]], [[Main Deck]], or [[Graveyard]], or is [[banish]]ed), it is removed from the game entirely. They are not considered to have been moved from the field to any other location.

  Tokens can be moved off the field to pay [[cost]]s or fulfill Summoning procedures, as long as the cost or Summoning procedure does not specify a destination other than the [[field]] for the cards needed to be moved. Banishing does not specify a destination, so a Token can be banished (except banished face-down) for a cost or Summoning procedure.

  Specific examples:
  * Tokens can be [[Tribute]]d for the Special Summon of "[[Destiny HERO - Plasma]]".
  * Tokens cannot be [[sent]] to the Graveyard for the Special Summon of "[[Arcana Force EX - The Dark Ruler]]".
  * Tokens can be banished for the effect cost of "[[Unibird]]".

  == Token card ==
  Official Token cards are grey. Most ''OCG'' cards from [[Series 8]] onward that correspond to specific Monster Tokens have that Monster Token's name printed as their own name, and sometimes also include the [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] of that Monster Token printed on the card (see [[Card layout#Series 8 layout|Card layout §&nbsp;Series 8 layout]]); the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|TCG]]'' started following this trend later.

  The first Token Card that did not correspond to a specific Monster Token was the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's National Championship 2009 promotional cards|National Championship 2009 Token]], which in 2009 was given to participants of United States and Canada's National Championships and participants of the European and South American Continental Championships.

  === Card text ===
  Prior to [[Series 8]] in the ''OCG'' and [[Series 9]] in the ''TCG'', all Token cards share the same [[card text]] and name ([[Token (card)|Token]]). From these series onward in the respective games, some Token cards have different names or card text.

  == Appearances ==
  === Anime ===
  Before ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL]]'', Monster Tokens did not appear as cards on the Duelists' Duel Disks, but rather the activated Spell/Trap or a monster left the field that Summoned them. In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS]]'', Token cards disappeared from Duel Disks, but they are rendered on field overviews.

  === Video games ===
  In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Joey the Passion]]'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos: Kaiba the Revenge]]'', Token cards are yellow like [[Normal Monster]]s, while their artwork is a golden-recolored international artwork of "[[Spellbinding Circle]]", making them distinguishable only by their names and stats. In other video games, Tokens are gray and mostly use the same artwork as the card that Summons them, with exceptions including all of those that have been printed with stats in the ''OCG''/''TCG'' (e.g. "[[Emissary of Darkness Token]]"), though a few that are not are given unique artworks too (e.g. "[[Vague Shadow Token]]").

  == Trivia ==
  * There are currently no [[Psychic]] or [[Sea Serpent]] Tokens.
