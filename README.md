The [YAML Yugi](https://github.com/DawnbrandBots/yaml-yugi) project aims to create a comprehensive, machine-readable,
human-editable database of the _Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game_ and _Official Card Game_. This is an automatically-updated
collection of wikitexts from Yugipedia of cards for intake and transformation into the final database.

All files under [`/wikitext`](/wikitext) are downloaded using the Mediawiki API and copyright belongs to their original
